#### Local Setup (Standard)

Assuming you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed on your system (*hint: for ease of managing ruby gems, consider using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)*), first click [Use this template](https://docs.github.com/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) above the file list, create a new repository at `github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>` from `github.com:alshedivat/al-folio` and do the following:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
$ cd <your-repo-name>
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --lsi
```

Now, feel free to customize the theme however you like (don't forget to change the name!).
After you are done, **commit** your final changes.

#### Deployment

Deploying your website to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is the most popular option.
Starting version [v0.3.5](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/releases/tag/v0.3.5), **al-folio** will automatically re-deploy your webpage each time you push new changes to your repository! :sparkles:

**For personal and organization webpages:**
1. Rename your repository to `<your-github-username>.github.io` or `<your-github-orgname>.github.io`.
2. In `_config.yml`, set `url` to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io` and leave `baseurl` empty.
3. Set up automatic deployment of your webpage (see instructions below).
4. Make changes, commit, and push!
5. After deployment, the webpage will become available at `<your-github-username>.github.io`.

**For project pages:**
1. In `_config.yml`, set `url` to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io` and `baseurl` to `/<your-repository-name>/`.
2. Set up automatic deployment of your webpage (see instructions below).
3. Make changes, commit, and push!
4. After deployment, the webpage will become available at `<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/`.

**To enable automatic deployment:**
1. Click on **Actions** tab and **Enable GitHub Actions**; do not worry about creating any workflows as everything has already been set for you.
2. Go to Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions, and give **Read and write permissions** to GitHub Actions
3. Make any other changes to your webpage, commit, and push. This will automatically trigger the **Deploy** action.
4. Wait for a few minutes and let the action complete. You can see the progress in the **Actions** tab. If completed successfully, in addition to the `master` branch, your repository should now have a newly built `gh-pages` branch.
5. Finally, in the **Settings** of your repository, in the Pages section, set the branch to `gh-pages` (**NOT** to `master`). For more details, see [Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source).


<details><summary>(click to expand) <strong>Manual deployment to GitHub Pages:</strong></summary>

If you need to manually re-deploy your website to GitHub pages, run the deploy script from the root directory of your repository:
```bash
$ ./bin/deploy
```
uses the `master` branch for the source code and deploys the webpage to `gh-pages`.

 
## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/master/LICENSE).

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](https://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).
Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
