  ABSTRACT =	 {Joint Species Distribution Models (JSDM) provide a
                  general multivariate framework to study the joint
                  abundances of all species from a community. JSDM
                  account for both structuring factors (environmental
                  characteristics or gradients, such as habitat type
                  or nutrient availability) and potential interactions
                  between the species (competition, mutualism,
                  parasitism, etc.), which is instrumental in
                  disentangling meaningful ecological interactions
                  from mere statistical associations. Modeling the
                  dependency between the species is challenging
                  because of the count-valued nature of abundance data
                  and most JSDM rely on Gaussian latent layer to
                  encode the dependencies between species in a
                  covariance matrix. The multivariate
                  Poisson-lognormal (PLN) model is one such model,
                  which can be viewed as a multivariate mixed Poisson
                  regression model. Inferring such models raises both
                  statistical and computational issues, many of which
                  were solved in recent contributions using
                  variational techniques and convex optimization
                  tools. The PLN model turns out to be a versatile
                  framework, within which a variety of analyses can be
                  performed, including multivariate sample comparison,
                  clustering of sites or samples, dimension reduction
                  (ordination) for visualization purposes, or
                  inferring interaction networks. This paper presents
                  the general PLN framework and illustrates its use on
                  a series a typical experimental datasets. All the
                  models and methods are implemented in the

  abstract =	 {In many cancers, mechanisms of gene regulation can
                  be severely altered. Identification of deregulated
                  genes, which do not follow the regulation processes
                  that exist between transcription factors and their
                  target genes, is of importance to better understand
                  the development of the disease. We propose a
                  methodology to detect deregulation mechanisms with a
                  particular focus on cancer subtypes. This strategy
                  is based on the comparison between tumoral and
                  healthy cells. First, we use gene expression data
                  from healthy cells to infer a reference gene
                  regulatory network. Then, we compare it with gene
                  expression levels in tumor samples to detect
                  deregulated target genes. We finally measure the
                  ability of each transcription factor to explain
                  these deregulations. We apply our method on a public
                  bladder cancer data set derived from The Cancer
                  Genome Atlas project and confirm that it captures
                  hallmarks of cancer subtypes. We also show that it
                  enables the discovery of new potential biomarkers. }
