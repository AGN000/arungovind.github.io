	abstract = {Background Ticks transmit pathogens of medical and veterinary importance, and represent an increasing threat for human and animal health. Important steps in assessing disease risk and developing possible new future control strategies involve identifying tick-borne microbes, their temporal dynamics and interactions.Methods Using high throughput sequencing, we studied the microbiota dynamics of Ixodes ricinus from 371 nymphs collected monthly over three consecutive years in a peri-urban forest. After adjusting a Poisson Log Normal model to our data set, the implementation of a principal component analysis as well as sparse network reconstruction and differential analysis allowed us to assess inter-annual, seasonal and monthly variability of I. ricinus microbial communities as well as their interactions.Results Around 75\% of the detected sequences belonged to five genera known to be maternally inherited bacteria in arthropods and potentially circulating in ticks: Candidatus Midichloria, Rickettsia, Spiroplasma, Arsenophonus and Wolbachia. The structure of the I. ricinus microbiota was temporally variable with interannual recurrence and seemed to be mainly driven by OTUs belonging to environmental genera. The total network analysis revealed a majority of positive (partial) correlations. We identified strong relationships between OTUs belonging to Wolbachia and Arsenophonus, betraying the presence of the parasitoid wasp Ixodiphagus hookeri in ticks, and the well known arthropod symbiont Spiroplasma, previously documented to be involved in the defense against parasitoid wasp in Drosophila melanogaster. Other associations were observed between the tick symbiont Candidatus Midichloria and pathogens belonging to Rickettsia, probably Rickettsia helvetica. More specific network analysis finally suggested that the presence of pathogens belonging to genera Borrelia, Anaplasma and Rickettsia might disrupt microbial interactions in I. ricinus.Conclusions Here, we identified the I. ricinus microbiota and documented for the first time the existence and recurrence of marked temporal shifts in the tick microbial community dynamics. We statistically showed strong relationships between the presence of some pathogens and the structure of the I. ricinus non-pathogenic microbes. We interestingly detected close links between some tick symbionts and the potential presence of either pathogenic Rickettsia or a parasitoid in ticks. All these new findings might be very promising for the future development of new control strategies of ticks and tick-borne diseases.Competing Interest StatementAuthor Cedric Midoux was employed by the company Irstea.

Using field abundances of eight sympatric Tephritid fruit flies on 21 host plants, we inferred flies{\textquoteright} realized niches using joint species distribution modelling and network inference, on the community as a whole and separately on three groups of host plants. These inferences were then confronted to flies{\textquoteright} fundamental niches estimated through laboratory-measured fitnesses on host plants. Species abundances were mainly determined by host plants followed by climatic factors, with a minor role for competition between species sharing host plants. The relative importance of these factors mildly changed when we focused on particular host plant groups. Despite overlapping fundamental niches, specialists and generalists had almost distinct realized niches, with possible competitive exclusion of generalists by specialists on Cucurbitaceae and different assembly rules: specialists were mainly influenced by their adaptation to host plants while generalist abundances varied regardless of their fundamental host use.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.}

	abstract = {Interactions between plant pathogens and other plant-associated microorganisms regulate disease. Deciphering the networks formed by these interactions, termed pathobiomes, is crucial to disease management. Our aim was to investigate whether microbial association networks inferred from metabarcoding data give relevant insights into pathobiomes, by testing whether inferred associations contain signals of ecological interactions. We used Poisson Lognormal Models to construct microbial association networks from metabarcoding data and then investigated whether some of these associations corresponded to interactions measurable in co-cultures or known in the literature, by using grapevine (Vitis vinifera) and the fungal pathogen causing powdery mildew (Erysiphe necator) as a model system. Our model suggested that the pathogen species was associated with 23 other fungal species, forming its putative pathobiome. These associations were not known as interactions in the literature, but one of them was confirmed by our co-culture experiments. The yeast Buckleyzyma aurantiaca impeded pathogen growth and reproduction, in line with the negative association found in the microbial network. Co-cultures also supported another association involving two yeast species. Together, these findings indicate that microbial networks can provide plausible hypotheses of ecological interactions that could be used to develop microbiome-based strategies for crop protection.}
