	abstract = {This chapter explores the intersection of white and male supremacy, both of which misrepresent women as genetically and intellectually inferior and reduce them to reproductive and/or sexual functions. The white power movement historically has been characterized by sexism and misogyny, as evidenced by the movement’s attempts to retain European heritage and maintain whiteness by policing the behavior and controlling the bodies of white women. However, the influence of white supremacist discourses on physically violent manifestations of the male supremacist movement remains largely understudied. Using supervised machine learning, we compare a corpus of violent male supremacist manifestos and other multimodal content with highly influential white nationalist texts and the manifestos of violent white supremacists to identify the shared beliefs, tropes and justifications for violence deployed within.},

They investigate how ISIS consolidated stable economic practices by way of illicit activities, while simultaneously justifying traditional monetary economics in an attempt to appeal to the organization’s performance and effectiveness as means of legitimation. These economic appeals of legitimation were not solely attempts to mobilize popular support, but also to assert the portrayal of sovereignty to an international audience.},

It also highlights that religion and ideology, whilst interwoven throughout posts on both platforms, they were more explicitly discussed within Women Dawah data.Originality/Value – This research uses a unique data set which was collected over one year to conduct a cross-ideological and multi-linguistic thematic analysis, a relatively uncommon approach.},

It identifies future areas of needed communication research related to both terrorism and counterterrorism efforts. To illustrate terrorism-related communication studies, it concludes with a content analysis examining how ISIS changed the quantity and nature of online visual messaging campaign in response to intensified battlefield operations for recapturing East Mosul in 2016–2017. The findings indicate that initially ISIS significantly increased its photographic output and relied more heavily on the about to die trope in response to heightened on-the-ground military actions.},
