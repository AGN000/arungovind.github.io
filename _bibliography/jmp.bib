  title={A Macro-Finance model with Realistic Crisis Dynamics},
  author={Goutham, Gopalakrishna},
  abstract={Financial recessions are characterized by a large risk premium and slow recovery. However, macro-finance models have trouble matching these empirical features. In this paper, I build a macro-finance model with stochastic productivity and state-dependent exit of experts that quantitatively explains salient features of a financial crisis. I calibrate my model to the executive turnover and efficiency data in financial institutions and show that it resolves a tension between the amplification and persistence of a financial recession, and generates realistic crisis dynamics. High exit at the onset of a crisis creates a net worth trap with long-lasting economic consequences.},
