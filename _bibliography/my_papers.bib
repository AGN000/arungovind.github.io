  abstract      = {Motivated by applications from ride-sharing and kidney exchange, we study the problem of matching agents who arrive at a marketplace over time and leave after $d$ time periods. Agents can only be matched while they are present in the marketplace. Each pair of agents can yield a different match value, and the planner's goal is to maximize the total value over a finite time horizon.
  First we study the case in which vertices arrive in an adversarial order. We provide  a randomized (1/4)-competitive algorithm building on a  result by Feldman et al. (WINE 2009) and Lehmann et al. (Games Econ Behav 2006). We extend the model to the case in which  departure times are drawn independently from a distribution with non-decreasing hazard rate, for which we establish a (1/8)-competitive algorithm.
  When the arrival order is chosen uniformly at random, we show that a batching algorithm, which computes a maximum-weighted matching every (d+1) periods, is 0.279-competitive.}

  abstract      = {Carpooling, or sharing a ride with other passengers, holds immense potential for urban transportation. Ridesharing platforms enable such sharing of rides using real-time data. Finding ride matches in real-time at urban scale is a difficult combinatorial optimization task and mostly heuristic approaches are applied. In this work, we mathematically model the problem as that of finding near-neighbors and devise a novel efficient spatio-temporal search algorithm based on the theory of locality sensitive hashing for Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS). The proposed algorithm can find k near-optimal potential matches for every ride from a pool of n rides in time O(n^(1 + \rho) (k + log n) log k)$ and space $O(n^(1 + \rho) log k)$ for a small \rho < 1. Our algorithm can be extended in several useful and interesting ways increasing its practical appeal. Experiments with large NY yellow taxi trip datasets show that our algorithm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heuristic methods thereby proving its practical applicability.}
