  abstract={Using real walking to control the playback of the 360째 videos is a natural and immersive way to match visual and self-motion perception. Redirected walking can enable users to walk in limited physical tracking space but experience larger scenes. Environment size may affect user perception in 360째 videos. We conducted a user study about the detection thresholds (DTs) for translation and rotation gains in 360째 video-based virtual environments in three scenes with different widths. Results show that environment size of the scene increases the DTs for both lower and upper translation gains but doesn't affect the DTs for rotation gains.},
