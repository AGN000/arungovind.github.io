  abstract = {In the airway network of a human lung, the airway diameter gradually decreases through multiple branching. The diameter reduction ratio of the conducting airways that transport gases without gas exchange is 0.79, but this reduction ratio changes to 0.94 in acinar airways beyond transitional bronchioles. While the reduction in the conducting airways was previously rationalized on the basis of Murray's law, our understanding of the design principle behind the acinar airways has been far from clear. Here we elucidate that the change in gas transfer mode is responsible for the transition in the diameter reduction ratio. The oxygen transfer rate per unit surface area is maximized at the observed geometry of acinar airways, which suggests the minimum cost for the construction and maintenance of the acinar airways. The results revitalize and extend the framework of Murray's law over an entire human lung.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
