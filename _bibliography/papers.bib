  title={Multiple Sex- and Circuit-Specific Mechanisms Underlie Exercise-Induced Stress Resistance},

  abstract={Prior physical activity reduces the risk of future stress-related mental health disorders including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Rodents allowed to engage in voluntary wheel running are similarly protected from behavioral consequences of stress. The present review summarizes current knowledge on mechanisms underlying exercise-induced stress resistance. A conceptual framework involving the development (during exercise) and expression (during stress) of stress resistance from exercise is proposed. During the development of stress resistance, adaptations involving multiple exercise signals and molecular mediators occur within neural circuits orchestrating various components of the stress response, which then respond differently to stress during the expression of stress resistance. Recent data indicate that the development and expression of stress resistance from exercise involve multiple independent mechanisms that depend on sex, stressor severity, and behavioral outcome. Recent insight into the role of the prefrontal cortex in exercise-induced stress resistance illustrates these multiple mechanisms. This knowledge has important implications for the design of future experiments aimed at identifying the mechanisms underlying exercise-induced stress resistance.},

  title={The role of the parafascicular thalamic nucleus in action initiation and steering},
  author={Fallon IP, Hughes RN, Severino FPU, Kim N, Lawry CM, Watson GDR, Roschina M, Yin HH},
  abstract={The parafascicular (Pf) nucleus of the thalamus has been implicated in arousal and attention, but its contributions to behavior remain poorly characterized. Here, using in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology, optogenetics, and 3D motion capture, we studied the role of the Pf nucleus in behavior using a continuous reward-tracking task in freely moving mice. We found that many Pf neurons precisely represent vector components of velocity, with a strong preference for ipsiversive movements. Their activity usually leads velocity, suggesting that Pf output is critical for self-initiated orienting behavior. To test this hypothesis, we expressed excitatory or inhibitory opsins in VGlut2+ Pf neurons to manipulate neural activity bidirectionally. We found that selective optogenetic stimulation of these neurons consistently produced ipsiversive head turning, whereas inhibition stopped turning and produced downward movements. Taken together, our results suggest that the Pf nucleus can send continuous top-down commands that specify detailed action parameters (e.g., direction and speed of the head), thus providing guidance for orienting and steering during behavior.},

  title={Force tuning explains changes in phasic dopamine signaling during stimulus-reward learning.},
  author={Bakhurin K, Hughes, RN, Jiang Q, Fallon IP Yin, HH},
  abstract={According to a popular hypothesis, phasic dopamine (DA) activity encodes a reward prediction error (RPE) necessary for reinforcement learning. However, recent work showed that DA neurons are necessary for performance rather than learning. One limitation of previous work on phasic DA signaling and RPE is the limited behavioral measures. Here, we measured subtle force exertion while recording and manipulating DA activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) during stimulus-reward learning. We found two major populations of DA neurons that increased firing before forward and backward force exertion. Force tuning is the same regardless of learning, reward predictability, or outcome valence. Changes in the pattern of force exertion can explain results traditionally used to support the RPE hypothesis, such as modulation by reward magnitude, probability, and unpredicted reward delivery or omission. Thus VTA DA neurons are not used to signal RPE but to regulate force exertion during motivated behavior.},
