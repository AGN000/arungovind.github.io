  abstract={This book presents maps and discussion of changing settlement patterns through seven thousand years across an intensively surveyed area of 765 square kilometers in northeastern China that lies near the traditional frontier between the large settled agricultural zone of the Yellow River basin and the varied, sometimes mobile, pastoral, and agricultural adaptations of Eurasia. Attention is focused on field and analytical methods for reconstructing ancient populations and their distributions.},

  year={2011},
  abstract={This volume and the accompanying online dataset provide the complete results of a regional settlement study of 1,234 square kilometers in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of northeastern China. Results of systematic study of the relationship between surface and subsurface remains are presented, based on sites that were surveyed as part of the regional survey, and subsequently intensively surface collected and test excavated. The volume concludes with a comprehensive synthesis of the regional trajectory of social change from 6000 BCE to 1300 CE, offered as a basis for comparison with those of other regions where complex societies developed.},

  abstract = {Archaeological analysis at the regional scale investigates the past by studying how people distributed themselves and their activities across a landscape of hundreds or thousands of square kilometers. Archaeological field survey methods developed over half a century combine with powerful new quantitative tools for spatial analysis (including GIS) to unleash new potential for identifying and studying ancient local communities and regional polities. Varied approaches to estimating regional population sizes in both relative and absolute terms are synthesized and their advantages and disadvantages assessed. Tools for quantitative analysis of regional demographic data are presented. Field survey methods developed around the world are compiled from widely scattered sources and best practices for collecting archaeological data to sustain demographic analysis are delineated. Concepts for improved sampling design in regional survey work are derived from fundamental statistical principles. In conclusion, promising directions for future methodological development are identified.},

  abstract={A detailed report on regional-, local-, and household-scale research on Hongshan societies (4500-3000 BCE) in northeastern China. Regional demography and community patterns are analyzed for an area of 200 square kilometers surrounding the excavated ceremonial site of Dongshanzui. More intensive study of Hongshan residential remains through surface collection, magnetometer survey, and stratigraphic tests informs the interpretation of the results of regional-scale survey. Dongshanzui's public architecture, along with additional unexcavated ceremonial platforms, are shown to be at the heart of a regional-scale concentration of Hongshan residential occupation that represents an independent small chiefly polity with no more than 1,000 inhabitants. Its neighbors were other similar small polities related to each other through peaceful interaction but without larger-scale political integration. Complete text in English and Chinese.},

  abstract={Archaeological research has by now revealed a great deal of variation in the way early complex societies, or chiefdoms, developed. This variation is widely recognized, but our understanding of the forces that produced it remains relatively undeveloped. This paper takes aim at such understanding by exploring variation in the local economies of six early chiefdoms; it considers what implications this variation had for trajectories of chiefdom development, as well as the source of that variation. Economic exchange is a primary form of local interaction in all societies. Because of distance-interaction principles, closer household spacing within local communities facilitated more frequent interaction and thus encouraged productive differentiation, economic interdependence, and the development of well-integrated local economies. Well-integrated local economies, in turn, provided ready opportunities for aspiring leaders to accumulate wealth and fund political economies, and pursuit of these opportunities led to societies with leaders whose power had a direct economic base. Wider household spacing, on the other hand, impeded interaction and the development of well-integrated local economies. In such contexts, aspiring leaders were able to turn to ritual and religion as a base of social power. Even when well-integrated local economies offered opportunities for wealth accumulation and a ready source of funding for political economies, these opportunities were not always taken advantage of. That variation in the shapes of early chiefdoms can be traced back to patterns of household spacing highlights the importance of settlement and interaction in explaining not just chiefdom development, but societal change more generally.},

  abstract={A longstanding theme in Chinese archaeology is the emergence of “Chinese civilization”. Hongshan societies represent the first clear steps toward complex social, political, and economic organization in this part of the world. And yet, it is Hongshan symbolism and ideology that has most captivated archaeologists, with many pinpointing Hongshan society as the originator of some quintessentially Han Chinese cultural elements. This chapter lays the groundwork for a fuller understanding of Hongshan period social dynamics in northeast China by focusing instead on ceremonialism and social hierarchy, settlements and communities, and household productive differentiation. In so doing, it seeks to better position Hongshan society within the broader field of comparative analysis by achieving finer chronological control within the Hongshan period. Concrete suggestions are offered for the shape that future research should take.},
