      author={Hongjie Wu and Linchao He and Mingqin Zhang and Dongdong Chen and Kunming Luo and Mengting Luo and Ji-Zhe Zhou and Hu Chen and Jiancheng Lv},
      abstract={Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in generating high-quality samples. Existing diffusion-based image restoration algorithms exploit pre-trained diffusion models to leverage data priors, yet they still preserve elements inherited from the unconditional generation paradigm. These strategies initiate the denoising process with pure white noise and incorporate random noise at each generative step, leading to over-smoothed results. In this paper, we introduce a refined paradigm for diffusion-based image restoration. Specifically, we opt for a sample consistent with the measurement identity at each generative step, exploiting the sampling selection as an avenue for output stability and enhancement. Besides, we start the restoration process with an initialization combined with the measurement signal, providing supplementary information to better align the generative process. Extensive experimental results and analyses validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach across diverse image restoration tasks.},

      title={Fast and Stable Diffusion Inverse Solver with History Gradient Update}, 
      author={Linchao He and Hongyu Yan and Mengting Luo and Hongjie Wu and Kunming Luo and Wang Wang and Wenchao Du and Hu Chen and Hongyu Yang and Yi Zhang and Jiancheng Lv},
      abstract={Diffusion models have recently been recognised as efficient inverse problem solvers due to their ability to produce high-quality reconstruction results without relying on pairwise data training. Existing diffusion-based solvers utilize Gradient Descent strategy to get a optimal sample solution. However, these solvers only calculate the current gradient and have not utilized any history information of sampling process, thus resulting in unstable optimization progresses and suboptimal solutions. To address this issue, we propose to utilize the history information of the diffusion-based inverse solvers. In this paper, we first prove that, in previous work, using the gradient descent method to optimize the data fidelity term is convergent. Building on this, we introduce the incorporation of historical gradients into this optimization process, termed History Gradient Update (HGU). We also provide theoretical evidence that HGU ensures the convergence of the entire algorithm. It's worth noting that HGU is applicable to both pixel-based and latent-based diffusion model solvers. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to previous sampling algorithms, sampling algorithms with HGU achieves state-of-the-art results in medical image reconstruction, surpassing even supervised learning methods. Additionally, it achieves competitive results on natural images.},
