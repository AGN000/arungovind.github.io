  abstract={Style transfer is a subset of image transformation problem in which the output is a combination of the style of a reference image and the content of an input image. Despite recent advances in image processing, video style transfer is still a challenging problem. One can implement such methods on a video, considering each frame independently. However, an unpleasant flickering effect will be observable in the output. Here, we propose a method to properly transfer a reference style to the input frames while preserving the temporal consistency. Thus, the flickering effect will be considerably mitigated. The proposed method is compared to two video style transfer methods using Sintel dataset. Results show that the proposed method keeps a better trade-off between temporal consistency and spatial losses.},
