The working group considered 17 venues, including CER conferences and journals, as well as overlapping conferences in Software Engineering and Human Factors. In this presentation, we consider some of the common review criteria observed across venues as well as some of the ethical concerns that emerge in peer-review and the process itself. These elements are considered through the lens of excerpts and vignettes drawn from conference chairs and journal editors interviewed by the working group that reflect aspects of the conversations and debates that have happened during the week at the present seminar.}

Leading into that is a collection of ideas and misconceptions which are drawn on in defining and motivating ?ground rules?, which are hints and guidance on the need for various often neglected categories. These are also helpful in justifying some additional categories which make the set as a whole more useful in combination.

These are followed by some suggested uses for the categories, and a discussion assessing how the success of the paper might be judged.

This entails deciding the order of topics, and explaining that to students. Sequence in the course is only one kind of relationship between topics in the module; relevance to work is another. Such explaining is a neglected educational issue. This paper addresses how to convey these relationships to learners. Because of the WBL context, it is inevitable that questions about how pieces of academic learning relate to the work context (which these students are already experiencing) arise immediately and vividly for them. This is important because it affects learner motivation, sometimes greatly, and also whether they are likely to learn in a surface or a deep mode. A given learner's grasp of these relationships is both individual and changes over time. Because of this, the general pedagogical approach discussed here is ?little and often?: raising it a number of times, with an emphasis not on one exhaustive and rigid view but on how different students often see it differently, and encouraging each to gradually develop their own view. The concept map diagram in this paper illustrates only one example of how the web of connections might be represented and conveyed during the course.},

We examine peer review from three viewpoints, those of community, process, and expectations:

The community of reviewers How are reviewers recruited and selected? How are they trained? What feedback do they get? What roles are there in the review process? What titles correspond to these roles?

Process: from review to decision How are reviewers matched to papers? How are the reviews used in making accept/reject decisions? What are the possible decisions? Are there multi- ple rounds of reviewing? What information is shared among reviewers, program chairs, and authors?

Expectations What is a reviewer expected to do when review- ing a paper? What are the reviews intended to accomplish, and who is the intended audience? What are the ethical rules associated with reviewing? How is a reviewer supposed to deal with issues of broken anonymity (if applicable)?

This examination is based on multiple data sources: published standards and descriptions from computing education conferences and journals; interviews with people who have served in various edito- rial and reviewing roles; papers and stated review principles from other disciplines. The working group report will present the compiled standards and guidance for mentoring reviewers.},

It considers four key components of peer review in some depth: criteria, the review process, roles and responsibilities, and ethics and etiquette. To do so, it draws on relevant literature, guidance and forms associated with peer review, interviews with journal editors and conference chairs, and a limited survey of the computing education research community.

At the same time, the cybersecurity field is broadening, not only in technical concepts but also in human factors, business processes, and international law. The field has not become culturally diversified, however. Professionals hired in 2018 included only 24.9\% women, 12.3\% African Americans, and 6.8\% Latinos.

New and integrated methods of attracting student populations in the field of cybersecurity are needed.

        abstract = {Many UK higher education institutions offer software engineering programmes, but the purpose and relevance of these programmes within computing science departments is not always obvious. The reality is that while advanced economies require many more skilled software engineers, universities are not delivering them. This is at least true in the context of the United Kingdom, where there are high numbers of software engineering vacancies and unemployed software engineering graduates. A possible explanation could be that curriculum content of software engineering programmes in universities needs to be reconsidered to meet the needs of industry. However, reconsidering curriculum content alone is unlikely to be transformative as there is little to be gained from changing to an emerging methodology, language or framework. Instead, an alternative direction could be to reconsider curriculum delivery and the identity of software engineering within computing science itself. In this paper, we contextualise the challenge by considering the history of software engineering education and some of its key developments. We then consider some of the alternative delivery approaches, before arguing cooperative programmes provide a opportunity for institutions to reconsider software engineering education.},

        abstract = {Cooperative programmes are principally partnerships between academia and industry to deliver education partly on campus and partly in the workplace. Mentors in the workplace are crucial in such cooperative programmes as they scaffold appropriate development activities for students. A workplace mentor in this situation is important not only for the development of detailed technical knowledge, but also in the development of software engineering skills that are almost never in fact taught in higher education, e.g. navigating large, neglected code bases. Consequently, workplace mentors are a key component of any high-quality education programme delivered in partnership with industry. However, higher education institutions and enterprises not only need to appreciate the importance of mentors in such schemes, but also ensure such staff are supported to use their experience to increase their skill as a mentor. Mentors need the space and support to reflect on their own practice, develop skills and attain new knowledge. In this sense, the challenge is not dissimilar to that faced by computing science school teachers that need to continually consider their own practice as well as have the time to consider emerging programming languages and frameworks.  Many of the structures and existing research on how to support computing science school teachers could be adapted to support these workplace mentors, e.g. support groups.

In this poster, we present initial research and models for mentoring mentors in cooperative software engineering programmes. The aim is to share initial work, receive feedback and to connect with potential collaborators.},

The first strategy prompts recording, the second reuse, but the third merits further investigation. It seemed promising to explore whether users could be subtly nudged towards stronger passwords.

Aim. The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of visual nudges on self-chosen password length and/or strength.

Method. A university application, enabling students to check course dates and review grades, was used to support two consecutive empirical studies over the course of two academic years. In total, 497 and 776 participants, respectively, were randomly assigned either to a control or an experimental group. Whereas the control group received no intervention, the experimental groups were presented with different visual nudges on the registration page of the web application whenever passwords were created. The experimental groups? password strengths and lengths were then compared that of the control group.

Results. No impact of the visual nudges could be detected, neither in terms of password strength nor length. The ordinal score metric used to calculate password strength led to a decrease in variance and test power, so that the inability to detect an effect size does not definitively indicate that such an effect does not exist.

Conclusion. We cannot conclude that the nudges had no effect on password strength. It might well be that an actual effect was not detected due to the experimental design choices. Another possible explanation for our result is that password choice is influenced by the user?s task, cognitive budget, goals and pre-existing routines. A simple visual nudge might not have the power to overcome these forces. Our lessons learned therefore recommend the use of a richer password strength quantification measure, and the acknowledgement of the user?s context, in future studies.}

The reconfigurable spaces with particular focus on technology, empower students in participative learning.

The challenge for educators is to recognise that such devices are not just generic pieces of plastic, but rather, highly personal devices. They are more than just a familiar tool. Smartphones share more similarities with a personal diary than a traditional desktop, they are pocket computers that contain countless conversations, notes and photographs.

The concern is that students may share more than they would like with the rest of the class. Smartphone sharing in an active learning space is little more than pushing pixels from a single small screen to several larger ones. It is an all or nothing experience. The potential result is that a student?s shared creation could be interrupted with a message from mum, balance notification from their bank or an invite to play a game. The brief experience not only serves to embarrass the student, but dissuade others from sharing in class.

Practically preserving the privacy of computing science students in active spaces has prompted my own thoughts on the challenges of sharing. These problems will be faced by students in varied domains as such spaces become prevalent. However, the solution should not been seen through a technical lens, but rather as an opportunity to reconsider the requirements of sharing and what it actually means in active learning spaces. The talk will consider solutions to preserving privacy as well as privacy challenges of in higher education before attempting to reconceptualising sharing for active learning. The aspiration is that reconsidering sharing might not only spare the blushes of students it could also produce stronger outcomes from active spaces.}

Practically preserving the privacy of computing science students in active spaces has prompted my own thoughts on the challenges of sharing. These problems will be faced by students in varied domains as such spaces become prevalent. However, the solution should not been seen through a technical lens, but rather as an opportunity to reconsider the requirements of sharing and what it actually means in active learning spaces. The talk will consider solutions to preserving privacy as well as privacy challenges of in higher education before attempting to reconceptualising sharing for active learning. The aspiration is that reconsidering sharing might not only spare the blushes of students it could also produce stronger outcomes from active spaces.}}

TEAL spaces support students in projecting presentations (e.g. from smart-phones) and sharing notes (e.g. from smart-watches) with peers. Importantly, this sharing is partly amongst their co-present small group but sometimes to the whole class. However, plugging personal things into smart spaces whose first requirement is to accept as many devices as possible is not without consequence. A projected notification of a political conversation, for example, has the potential to harm the individual both within the space and beyond, opening them to unwanted judgment, criticism and assessment.

The traditional argument from the usable security community is that of intervention prior to any use whatever: users need to be trained, taught and/or nudged to avoid such problems. We conducted an informal focus group with students in a pilot TEAL space, exploring issues around the privacy and security of using personal devices in such spaces. The reality is that it is hard to perceive the privacy and security challenges prior to using the space. We argue that such prior interventions are not only a significant barrier to student adoption of smart spaces, but ineffective in ensuring the safety of individuals in the long-term.

We argue that in designing smart spaces, both on-campus and off, designers need to adopt an approach of individually evolved privacy requirements to ensure an on-going safe, creative space for students. Two important features are: (a) as a small group develops bonds, its privacy level needs to be reduced over time and (b) the best privacy level depends on the whether the screen is currently shared with the small group or the large class.}, doi= {10.1145/3137003.3137009}}

channels involved in the process to be trustworthy; otherwise
authentication secrets can easily be compromised. Given the
unceasing efforts of attackers worldwide such trustworthiness
is increasingly not a given. A variety of technical solutions,
such as utilising multiple devices/channels and verification
protocols, has the potential to mitigate the threat of untrusted
communications to a certain extent. Yet such technical solutions
make two assumptions: (1) users have access to multiple
devices and (2) attackers will not resort to hacking the human,
using social engineering techniques. In this paper, we propose
and explore the potential of using human-based computation
instead of solely technical solutions to mitigate the threat of
untrusted devices and channels. ZeTA (Zero Trust Authentication
on untrusted channels) has the potential to allow people to
authenticate despite compromised channels or communications
and easily observed usage. Our contributions are threefold:
(1) We propose the ZeTA protocol with a formal definition
and security analysis that utilises semantics and human-based
computation to ameliorate the problem of untrusted devices
and channels. (2) We outline a security analysis to assess
the envisaged performance of the proposed authentication
protocol. (3) We report on a usability study that explores the

        abstract = {Research into graphical authentication has yet to be meaningfully transferred into industry. This is the case globally, but is concerning in Scotland as considerable research into the area has been published and presented by academics in SICSA universities (e.g. University of Glasgow, Glasgow Caledonian University, Napier University). The lack of knowledge transfer is particularly perplexing given the interest of industry in improving digital security. There are several explanations for the lack of progress, but a prominent issue is the inconsistency in reporting scientific data pertaining to graphical authentication. There is no framework for the reporting of field investigations into graphical authentication solutions. This situation not only hinders knowledge transfer into industry but the progress of research into alternative authentication solutions. Industry and researchers require metrics and strong qualitative data to utilise and progress research in the area. Consequently, the Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance (SICSA) has provided financial support for a research exchange for me to visit and work with Prof. Melanie Volkamer. The primary aim of the proposed exchange is to develop a field evaluation framework for graphical authentication solutions to ensure consistent reporting of scientific data. The Center for Advanced Security Research at Technische Universit{\"a}t Darmstadt has an established track record of transferring knowledge into industry. Notably, Prof. Melanie Volkamer from the Technische Universit{\"a}t Darmstadt, along with Dr Karen Renaud and myself at the University of Glasgow have collaborated and made progress in transferring knowledge of graphical authentication research into industry.}

Initial deployment did not reveal the problems of passwords, deep and profound flaws only emerged once passwords were deployed in the wild. The need for a replacement is widely acknowledged yet despite over a decade of research into knowledge-based alternatives, few, if any, have been adopted by industry. Alternatives are unconvincing for three primary reasons. The first is that alternatives are rarely investigated beyond the initial proposal, with only the results from a constrained lab test provided to convince adopters of their viability. The second is that alternatives are seldom tested realistically where the authenticator mediates access to something of value. The third is that the testing rarely varies the device or context beyond that initially targeted. In the modern world different devices are used across a variety of contexts. What works well in one context may easily fail in another. Consequently, the contribution of this paper is an "in the wild" evaluation of an alternative authentication mechanism that had demonstrated promise in its lab evaluation. In the field test the mechanism was deployed to actual users to regulate access to an application in a context beyond that initially proposed. The performance of the mechanism is reported and discussed. We conclude by reflecting on the value of field evaluations of alternative authentication mechanisms.}, doi= {10.1109/STAST.2015.13}}

In the virtual world this is generally replaced by self declaration. Some service providers resort to using heavy-weight identification mechanisms, judging adulthood as a side effect thereof. Collection of identification data arguably constitutes an unwarranted privacy invasion in this context, if carried out merely to perform adulthood estimation. This paper presents a mechanism that exploits the adult's more extensive exposure to public media, relying on the likelihood that they will be able to recall details if cued by a carefully chosen picture. We conducted an online study to gauge the viability of this scheme. With our prototype we were able to predict that the user was a child 99\% of the time. Unfortunately the scheme also misclassified too many adults. We discuss our results and suggest directions for future research.}, doi= {10.1145/2702123.2702456}}

This focus is misguided, since the alternatives do nothing to reduce the authentication footprint. The reality is that developers overuse authentication. The problem is not the authentication step, but rather its position in the path. Authentication is sometimes used even when there is no real need for it.

Is it at all possible to improve authentication? As researchers, we have primarily addressed this problem in one of three ways: (1) by trying to find a password replacement, (2) by formulating rules and regulations to coerce users into choosing stronger passwords, or (3) fostering a security culture within the organisation, hoping that the social pressure will induce people to behave more securely. These endeavours have met with limited success. Alternatives have not been embraced by the developer community, rules and regulations are often ignored, subverted or deliberately flouted. Fostering a security culture has had more success, in relative terms, but still has not really addressed the ?authentication problem?. The one thing these approaches have in common is their focus on the human agent: the end user.

Consider a related problem in the physical world: locks on doors. These have not changed in centuries and the doors themselves are probably weaker than they were a hundred years ago. Yet do locks really prevent intrusion? A determined intruder finds the average lock an minor deterrent, and the door itself is sometimes even made of glass, allowing the thief to subvert the lock entirely.

of fragments and discourage the destruction of them. However, there are potentially unforeseen costs, in

Where it has been done, it has mainly been for students where the technology itself was also relevant to their studies (e.g. computing science or media studies courses). Here however we report on one of these on a course for ?non-technical? students from the faculty of Arts. These students were required to produce a single video podcast for their third-year philosophy course. The requirements to present something useful to fellow students and to master a new and fashionable technology are well designed to augment self-confidence and self-efficacy, to engage students, to equip them with a skill that may enhance their employability, and to foster deeper learning. However a basic reason for student generated content of this kind is that authoring for other students (rather than for marking by a staff member) should give impetus to deeper thought about the content. This would not only cement existing knowledge but also supplement it with new perspectives and considerations. Sceptics might argue differently, claiming it to be a gimmick to boost course numbers. However, crafting a report, essay or regurgitating facts on exam day involve different learning experiences and skills to that of giving a persuasive presentation to a large audience.}

However, it is clearly inadequate in a world where increasing numbers of systems and services require people to authenticate in a shared space, while being actively observed. This new reality places pressure on a password mechanism never intended for use in such a context. Asterisks may obfuscate alphanumeric characters on entry but popular systems, e.g. Apple iPhone and Nintendo Wii, regularly require users to use an on-screen keyboard for character input. This may not be a real concern within the context of secluded space but inadvertly reveals a secret within shared space. Such a secret has an economic cost in terms of replacement, recall and revenue, all of which affect the financial return of the offending systems and services.\&lt;/p\&gt;

\&lt;p\&gt;In this paper, we present and evaluate a graphical authentication mechanism, Tetrad, which appears to have the potential to address these specific concerns.\&lt;/p\&gt;}
