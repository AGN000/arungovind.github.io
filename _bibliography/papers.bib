  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={"Consider a repeated single item auction with a single buyer who has a value for the item randomly drawn from known distribution $\mathcal{D}$ each round and bids according to an online learning algorithm. ``Selling to a No-Regret Buyer" by Braverman et al. presents a strategy for the seller which, whenever the buyer bids according to a mean-based learning algorithm, extracts revenue that is arbitrarily close to the expected welfare. We extend these results to two settings where the bidder does not use a simple mean-based learning algorithm. First, we consider a bidder using a mean-based learning algorithm with recency bias, where the results of recent rounds are weighed more strongly. We show how much revenue the strategy yields as a function of the recency bias factor $\beta$. Next, we consider a bidder using a $k$-switching learning algorithm, where what we define as a \textit{g-mean-based} learning algorithm is given as options all ``meta-strategies" which switch bids at most $k$ times. We present a new strategy and show how much revenue it yields as a function of the $g$ for which the learning algorithm is $g$-mean-based. In both settings, we also determine which parameter values allow the algorithm to be no-regret, and which yield revenue that is arbitrarily close to the welfare."}
