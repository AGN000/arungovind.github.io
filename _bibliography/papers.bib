	abstract = {Event camera is bio-inspired vision sensors that output pixel-level brightness changes asynchronously. Compared to the conventional frame-based camera, it is with high dynamic range, low latency and high sensitivity, and thus can be exploited in SLAM to tackle the problem of occasions with high-speed camera moving and low-light scenes. In this demo, we implement the visual-inerial SLAM in real time with the recently released event camera, namely, CeleX-V. With the feature of high spatial resolution (1280×800) and low latency ({\textless} 0.5µs), the proposed method can provide frames with abundant textures and high time response, which leads to more stable tracking ability and better performance in SLAM system.},

	abstract = {Lane extraction is a basic yet necessary task for autonomous driving. Although past years have witnessed major advances in lane extraction with deep learning models, they all aim at ordinary RGB images generated by framebased cameras, which limits their performance in nature. To tackle this problem, we introduce Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS), a type of event-based sensor to lane extraction task and build a high-resolution DVS dataset for lane extraction (DET). We collect the raw event data and generate 5,424 event-based sensor images with a resolution of 1280×800, the highest one among all DVS datasets available now. These images include complex trafﬁc scenes and various lane types. All images of DET are annotated with multi-class segmentation format. The fully annotated DET images contains 17,103 lane instances, each of which is labeled pixel by pixel manually. We evaluate state-of-the-art lane extraction models on DET to build a benchmark for lane extraction task with event-based sensor images. Experimental results demonstrate that DET is quite challenging for even state-of-the-art lane extraction methods. DET is made publicly available, including the raw event data, accumulated images and labels1.},

Different from the numerical methods realized by iterative algorithm, the recent continuous approach is realized through analog circuit, which takes advantage of short time-delay and fast convergence. However, the existing continuous method for SR still has the space to further improve the convergence speed. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a new dynamical continuous system to solve the sparse signal recovery problem with fixed-time convergence property.},

	doi = {10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2890417},
	abstract = {The nuclear norm minimization method emerged from a patch-based low-rank model leads to an excellent image denoising performance, where the non-local self-similarity over image patches is exploited. However, natural images are normally with complex and irregular image patches, which cannot be well represented using only a low-rank model, and thus most of them suffer from the over-penalty problem especially for images with lots of local irregular structures (e.g., fine details or sharp edges), and then results in over-smoothing problem after denoising. On the other hand, in order to represent the irregular components, edges defined over pixel level are often exploited. While the total variation (TV) is a well-known prior to remove noises and preserve edges, it might yield undesired staircase artifacts. The total generalized variation (TGV), a generalization of TV, can largely alleviate such staircase artifacts. Consequently, in order to deal with the over-smoothing problem aroused by a low-rank model, we propose a re-weighted TGV regularized nuclear norm minimization model for local structure preserving image denoising. Thanks to the split Bregman method, our proposed model can be effectively solved. A re-weighted strategy is developed to adaptively update the weight parameters of TGV regularization. The encouraging experimental results on noisy images demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the problem of recovering sparse signals with cluster structure of unknown sizes and locations. A hybrid prior is proposed by introducing a local continuity indicator, which adaptively imposes cluster information on the sparse coefficients according to the inherent data structure. The local continuity indicator flexibly switches the prior for a sparse coefficient between a fully pattern-coupled one and an independent one, so that the estimation of the sparse coefficient can selectively use the statistical information of its neighbors. Variational Bayesian inference is used to estimate the hidden variables based on the constructed probabilistic modeling. Numerical results of comprehensive simulations and real data experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively avoid the problem of structural mismatch and outperform other recently reported clustered sparse signal recovery algorithms in noisy environments.},

An extension to nonlinear systems with inputs has then been deduced.},
