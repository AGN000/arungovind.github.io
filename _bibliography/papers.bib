  abstract = {We model the uncorrelated production of double quarkonium ({$\gamma$} and J/{$\psi$} mesons) in Pb+Pb collisions at {$\surd$}sNN= 5.02 TeV through implementation of a standard Monte Carlo Glauber model and a Monte Carlo particle production simulation, PYTHIA 8.306. A multinomial model, using probabilities obtained from relevant literature as well as from a PYTHIA simulation, was used to obtain estimates of double quarkonium yields corresponding to an integrated luminosity of L =1.7nb-1 collected by CMS in the 2018 PbPb run. Distributions from PYTHIA for the {$\gamma$} and J/{$\psi$} mesons and their daughter muons were used to calculate acceptance, and muon efficiencies were obtained from studies done in CMS. Estimates of the probability of production for the {$\gamma$} and J/{$\psi$} mesons were made from these values. The estimates of double quarkonium production can be used for comparison to future measurements to be performed at the CMS detector. Funded by the NSF through the REU program.},
