At the same time, timbre and the crossmodal metaphors that dominate its conceptualization can provide a test case for better understanding the neural basis of crossmodal correspondences and human semantic processing in general.},

  abstract = {In this study, we aim to better understand the cognitive-emotional experience of visually impaired people when navigating in unfamiliar urban environments, both outdoor and indoor. We propose a multimodal framework based on random forest classifiers, which predict the actual environment among predefined generic classes of urban settings, inferring on real-time, non-invasive, ambulatory monitoring of brain and peripheral biosignals. Model performance reached 93% for the outdoor and 87% for the indoor environments (expressed in weighted AUROC), demonstrating the potential of the approach. Estimating the density distributions of the most predictive biomarkers, we present a series of geographic and temporal visualizations depicting the environmental contexts in which the most intense affective and cognitive reactions take place. A linear mixed model analysis revealed significant differences between categories of vision impairment, but not between normal and impaired vision. Despite the limited size of our cohort, these findings pave the way to emotionally intelligent mobility-enhancing systems, capable of implicit adaptation not only to changing environments but also to shifts in the affective state of the user in relation to different environmental and situational factors.},

  abstract = {Academic disciplines spanning cognitive science, art, and music have made strides in understanding how humans sense and experience the world. We now have a better scientific understanding of how human sensation and perception function both in the brain and in interaction than ever before. However, there is little research on how this high level scientific understanding is translated into knowledge for the public more widely. We present descriptive results from a simple survey and compare how public understanding and perception of sensory experience lines up with scientific understanding. Results show that even in a sample with fairly high educational attainment, many respondents were unaware of fairly common forms of sensory variation. In line with the well-documented under representation of sign languages within linguistics, respondents tended to under-estimate the number of sign languages in the world. We outline how our results represent gaps in public understanding of sensory variation, and argue that filling these gaps can form an important early intervention, acting as a basic foundation for improving acceptance, inclusivity, and accessibility for cognitively diverse populations.},

As a result, the extent to which spectral modifications due to the outer ear interact with timbre perception is not fully understood. As a first step towards investigating this research question, we examine here whether timbre descriptors calculated using HRTF filtered instrumental sounds deviate across ears and from values obtained from the same sounds without HRTF filtering for different listeners. The sound set comprised isolated notes played at the same fundamental frequency and dynamic from a database of anechoic recordings of modern orchestral instruments and some of their classical and baroque precursors. These were convolved with anechoic high spatial resolution HRTFs of human listeners. We present results and discuss implications for research on timbre perception and cognition.},

We extract a set of lyrical features related to each song's overarching narrative, moral valence, sentiment, and emotion. A machine learning framework was designed to exploit regression approaches and evaluate the predictive power of lyrical features for inferring moral values. Results suggest that lyrics from top songs of artists people like inform their morality. Virtues of hierarchy and tradition achieve higher prediction scores (between .20 and .30) than values of empathy and equality (between .08 and .11), while basic demographic variables only account for a small part in the models' explainability. This shows the importance of music listening behaviours, as assessed via lyrical preferences, alone in capturing moral values.

We exploit both classification and regression approaches to assess the predictive power of music preferences for the prediction of demographic attributes as well as the moral values of the participants. Our findings point out that moral values are hard to predict (.62 AUROC_avg) solely by the music listening behaviours, while if basic sociodemographic information is provided the prediction score rises to 4% on average (.66 AUROC_avg), with the Purity foundation to be the one that is steadily the one with the highest accuracy scores. Similar results are obtained from the regression analysis.

However, both preference and richness ratings varied widely between individual violinists, likely because musicians conceptualize the same attribute in different ways. To better understand how richness is conceptualized by violinists and how it contributes to the perceived quality of a violin, we analyzed free verbal descriptions collected during a carefully controlled playing task (involving 16 violinists) and in an online survey where no sound examples or other contextual information was present (involving 34 violinists). The analysis was based on a psycholinguistic method, whereby semantic categories are inferred from the verbal data itself through syntactic context and linguistic markers. The main sensory property related to violin sound richness was expressed through words such as full, complex, and dense versus thin and small, referring to the perceived number of partials present in the sound. Another sensory property was expressed through words such as warm, velvety, and smooth versus strident, harsh, and tinny, alluding to spectral energy distribution cues. Haptic cues were also implicated in the conceptualization of violin sound richness.},

We present Seeing Music, a digital interactive exhibition and audiovisual game that translates high-level scientific understanding of sensory variation and cross-modality into knowledge for the public. Using a narrative-driven gamified approach, players are tasked with communicating human music to an extraterrestrial intelligence through visual shape, color and texture using two-dimensional selector panels. Music snippets (12–24 s long) are played continuously in a loop, taken from three custom instrumental compositions designed to vary systematically in terms of timbre, melody, and rhythm. Players can “level-up” to unlock new visual features and musical snippets, and explore and evaluate collaborative visualizations made by others. Outside the game, a series of interactive slideshows help visitors learn more about sensory experience, sensory diversity, and how our senses make us human. The exhibition debuted at the 2021 Edinburgh Science Festival, where it was visited by 197 users coming from 21 countries (134 visitors from the UK) over 16 days. As it continues running online, a further 596 visitors from 35 countries (164 from the UK) have engaged. To date, 169 players of Seeing Music have produced more than 42,500 audiovisual mapping datapoints for scientific research purposes. Preliminary analysis suggests that music with less high-frequency energy was mapped to less complex and rounder shapes, bluer and less bright hues, and less dense textures. These trends confirm auditory-visual correspondences previously reported in more controlled laboratory studies, while also offering new insight into how different auditory-visual associations interact with each other. Future work includes improving user motivation and interaction, refining data collection, a full open-source release, and adding new games and informational material about research on the senses.},

However, little work has been done in examining the affective impact of these commercials on the audience. It has been proven that repeated exposure to gender-stereotyped messages has the capacity to influence behaviours, beliefs and attitudes. In particular, media can influence emotion socialization, and gender differences in emotion expression might emerge (Scherr 2018). In this study, we investigated whether commercials elicit emotions at different intensities with respect to the gender of their target audience. Furthermore, we evaluated whether such emotions follow distinct underlying latent structures. A total of 1081 ratings of 10 unipolar aesthetic emotion scales were collected for 135 commercials (45 for each masculine, feminine, and mixed target audience) from 80 UK nationals (35 F, 45 M) aged 18 to 76. The main reason for collecting our ratings from adults was that, already by age 11, children exhibit adult-like emotion recognition capabilities (Hunter 2011). Seven scales showed significant differences between commercials for distinct audiences; with five, in particular, revealing a strong polarization (happiness, amusement, beauty, calm, and anger). In addition, parallel analysis showed that a minimum of three factors are needed to explain the ratings for masculine and mixed targeted commercials, while only two are needed for the feminine ones, thereby indicating that the latter elicit emotions following a simpler underlying structure. Both results reflect larger issues in toy marketing, where gender essentialism is still dominant, and prompt further discussion and research.},

It was found that a many-to-many approach supersedes a one-to-one approach in terms of reconstructive capabilities, while one-to-one showed better results in terms of adversarial translation. The adoption of a basic over a bottleneck residual block design is more suitable for enriching content information about a latent space, and the decision on whether cyclic loss takes on a variational autoencoder or vanilla autoencoder approach does not have a significant impact on reconstructive and adversarial translation aspects of the model.},

It is unclear whether insights from these studies generalise to electronic sounds, nor is it obvious how these relate to the creation of such sounds. In this work, we present an experiment on the semantic associations of sounds produced by FM synthesis with the aim of identifying whether existing models of timbre semantics are appropriate for such sounds. We applied a novel experimental paradigm in which experienced sound designers responded to semantic prompts by programming a synthesiser, and provided semantic ratings on the sounds they created. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a ﬁve-dimensional semantic space. The ﬁrst two factors mapped well to the concepts of luminance, texture, and mass. The remaining three factors did not have clear parallels, but correlation analysis with acoustic descriptors suggested an acoustical relationship to luminance and texture. Our results suggest that further enquiry into the timbres of disembodied electronic sounds, their synthesis, and their semantic associations would be worthwhile, and that this could beneﬁt research into auditory perception and cognition, as well as synthesis control and audio engineering.},

The NEWT uses time-distributed multilayer perceptrons with periodic activations to implicitly learn nonlinear transfer functions that encode the characteristics of a target timbre. Once trained, a NEWT can produce complex timbral evolutions by simple affine transformations of its input and output signals. We paired the NEWT with a differentiable noise synthesiser and reverb and found it capable of generating realistic musical instrument performances with only 260k total model parameters, conditioned on F0 and loudness features. We compared our method to state-of-the-art benchmarks with a multi-stimulus listening test and the Fréchet Audio Distance and found it performed competitively across the tested timbral domains. Our method significantly outperformed the benchmarks in terms of generation speed, and achieved real-time performance on a consumer CPU, both with and without FastNEWT, suggesting it is a viable basis for future creative sound design tools.},

  abstract  = {Research on timbre perception is typically conducted under controlled laboratory conditions where every effort is made to maintain stimulus presentation conditions fixed (McAdams, 2019). This conforms with the ANSI (1973) definition of timbre suggesting that in order to judge the timbre differences between a pair of sounds the rest perceptual attributes (i.e., pitch, duration and loudness) should remain unchanged. Therefore, especially in pairwise dissimilarity studies, particular care is taken to ensure that loudness is not used by participants as a criterion for judgements by equalising it across experimental stimuli. On the other hand, conducting online experiments is an increasingly favoured practice in the music perception and cognition field as targeting relevant communities can potentially provide a large number of suitable participants with relatively little time investment from the side of the experimenters (e.g., Woods et al., 2015). However, the strict requirements for stimuli preparation and presentation prevents timbre studies from conducting online experimentation. Despite the obvious difficulties in imposing equal loudness on online experiments, the different playback equipment chain (DACs, pre-amplifiers, headphones) will also almost inevitably ‘colour’ the sonic outcome in a different way. Despite the above limitations, in a social distancing time like this, it would be of major importance to be able to lift some of the physical requirements in order to carry on conducting behavioural research on timbre perception. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the extent to which an uncontrolled online replication of a past laboratory-conducted pairwise dissimilarity task will distort the findings.},

  abstract  = {The imitation of non-vocal sounds using the human voice is a resource we sometimes rely on when communicating sound concepts to other people. Query by Vocal Percussion (QVP) is a subfield in Music Information Retrieval (MIR) that explores techniques to query percussive sounds using vocal imitations as input, usually plosive consonant sounds. The goal of this work was to investigate timbral relationships between real drum sounds and their vocal imitations. We believe these insights could shed light on how to select timbre descriptors for extraction when designing offline and online QVP systems. In particular, we studied a dataset composed of 30 acoustic and electronic drum sound recordings and vocal imitations of each sound performed by 14 musicians. Our approach was to study the correlation of audio content descriptors of timbre extracted from the drum samples with the same descriptors taken from vocal imitations. Three timbral descriptors were selected: the Log Attack Time (LAT), the Spectral Centroid (SC), and the Derivative After Maximum of the sound envelope (DAM). LAT and SC have been shown to represent salient dimensions of timbre across different types of sounds including percussion. In this sense, one intriguing question would be to what extent listeners can communicate these salient timbral cues in vocal imitations. The third descriptor, DAM, was selected for its role in describing the sound’s tail, which we considered to be a relevant part of percussive utterances.},

From a psychoacoustic perspective, brightness ratings of instrumental timbres as well as music excerpts systematically correlate with the centre of gravity of the spectral envelope and thus brightness as a semantic descriptor of musical sound has come to denote a prevalence of high-frequency over low-frequency energy. However, relatively little is known about the higher-level cognitive processes underpinning musical brightness ratings. Psycholinguistic investigations of verbal descriptions of timbre suggest a more complex, polysemic picture (Saitis & Weinzierl 2019) that warrants further research. To better understand how musical brightness is conceptualised by listeners, here we analysed free verbal descriptions collected along brightness ratings of short music snippets (involving 69 listeners) and brightness ratings of orchestral instrument notes (involving 68 listeners). Such knowledge can help delineate the intrinsic structure of brightness as a perceptual attribute of musical sounds, and has broad implications and applications in orchestration, audio engineering, and music psychology.},

   abstract = {Timbre dissimilarity of orchestral sounds is well-known to be multidimensional, with attack time and spectral centroid representing its two most robust acoustical correlates. The centroid dimension is traditionally considered as reflecting timbral brightness. However, the question of whether multiple continuous acoustical and/or categorical cues influence brightness perception has not been addressed comprehensively. A triangulation approach was used to examine the dimensionality of timbral brightness, its robustness across different psychoacoustical contexts, and relation to perception of the sounds' source-cause. Listeners compared 14 acoustic instrument sounds in three distinct tasks that collected general dissimilarity, brightness dissimilarity, and direct multi-stimulus brightness ratings. Results confirmed that brightness is a robust unitary auditory dimension, with direct ratings recovering the centroid dimension of general dissimilarity. When a two-dimensional space of brightness dissimilarity was considered, its second dimension correlated with the attack-time dimension of general dissimilarity, which was interpreted as reflecting a potential infiltration of the latter into brightness dissimilarity. Dissimilarity data were further modeled using partial least-squares regression with audio descriptors as predictors. Adding predictors derived from instrument family and the type of resonator and excitation did not improve the model fit, indicating that brightness perception is underpinned primarily by acoustical rather than source-cause cues.},

The problem can be approached by using either engineered time-frequency features or raw audio as input. Modulation filter bank representations that have been actively researched as a basis for timbre perception have the potential to facilitate the extraction of perceptually salient features. We explore end-to-end learned front-ends for audio representation learning, ModNet and SincModNet, that incorporate a temporal modulation processing block. The structure is effectively analogous to a modulation filter bank, where the FIR filter center frequencies are learned in a data-driven manner. The expectation is that a perceptually motivated filter bank can provide a useful representation for identifying music features. Our experimental results provide a fully visualisable and interpretable front-end temporal modulation decomposition of raw audio. We evaluate the performance of our model against the state-of-the-art of music tagging on the MagnaTagATune dataset. We analyse the impact on performance for particular tags when time-frequency bands are subsampled by the modulation filters at a progressively reduced rate. We demonstrate that modulation filtering provides promising results for music tagging and feature representation, without using extensive musical domain knowledge in the design of this frontend.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate which phoneme-to-instrument mappings are the most robust for online transcription purposes. We used three different evaluation criteria to base our decision upon: frequency of use of phonemes among different performers, spectral similarity to reference drum sounds, and classification separability. With these criteria applied, the recommended mappings would potentially feel natural for performers to articulate while enabling the classification algorithms to achieve the best performance possible. Given the final results, we provided a detailed discussion on which phonemes to choose given different contexts and applications.},

The samples, from an extensive dataset of several timbre families, were rms normalized in order to eliminate the loudness information and force the network to focus on timbre attributes of musical dynamics that are shared across different instrument families. The proposed CNN architecture obtained competitive results in three classification tasks with all three input representations. In order to compare the different input representations, the test sets in three experiments were partitioned in order to promote or avoid selection bias. When selection bias was avoided, models trained on MPS were outperformed by those trained on time-frequency representations, conversely, those trained on MPS achieved the best results when selection bias was promoted. Low-temporal modulations emerged in classspecific MPS saliency maps as markers of musical dynamics. This led to the implementation of a MPS-based scalar descriptor of timbre that largely outperformed the chosen baseline (44.8{\%} error reduction).},

VPT classifiers usually learn best from small user-specific datasets, which usually restrict modelling to small input feature sets to avoid model overfitting. This study explores several deep supervised learning strategies to obtain informative feature sets for amateur VPT classification. We evaluated their performance on regular VPT classification tasks and compared them with several baseline approaches including feature selection methods and a state-of-the-art speech recognition engine. These proposed learning models were supervised with several label sets containing information from four different levels of abstraction: instrument-level, syllable-level, phoneme-level, and boxeme-level. Results suggest that convolutional neural networks supervised with syllable-level annotations produced the most informative embeddings for VPT systems, which can be used as input representations to fit classifiers with. Finally, we used back-propagation-based saliency maps to investigate the importance of difference spectrogram regions for feature learning.},

The analysis of the linguistic description of timbre, or timbre semantics, can be considered as one way to study its perceptual representation empirically. In the most commonly adopted approach, timbre is considered as a set of verbally defined perceptual attributes that represent the dimensions of a semantic timbre space. Previous studies have identified three salient semantic dimensions for timbre along with related acoustic properties. Comparisons with similarity-based multidimensional models confirm the strong link between perceiving timbre and talking about it. Still, the cognitive and neural mechanisms of timbre semantics remain largely unknown and underexplored, especially when one looks beyond the case of acoustic musical instruments.},

Roughly defined, timbre is thought of as any property other than pitch, duration, and loudness that allows two sounds to be distinguished. Current research unfolds along three main fronts: (1) principal perceptual and cognitive processes; (2) the role of timbre in human voice perception, perception through cochlear implants, music perception, sound quality, and sound design; and (3) computational acoustic modeling. Along these three scientific fronts, significant breakthroughs have been achieved during the decade prior to the production of this volume.

Auditory models of both temporal and spectral information can be related to aspects of timbre perception, whereas the excitation-filter model of sound production provides links to the acoustics of sound production. A brief review of the most common representations of audio signals used to extract audio descriptors related to timbre is followed by a discussion of the audio descriptor extraction process using those representations. This chapter covers traditional temporal and spectral descriptors, including harmonic description, time-varying descriptors, and techniques for descriptor selection and descriptor decomposition. The discussion is focused on conceptual aspects of the acoustic modeling of timbre and the relationship between the descriptors and timbre perception, semantics, and cognition, including illustrative examples. The applications covered in this chapter range from timbre psychoacoustics and multimedia descriptions to computer-aided orchestration and sound morphing.

  abstract = {Brightness is among the most studied aspects of timbre perception. Psychoacoustically, sounds described as ''bright'' vs ''dark'' typically exhibit a high vs low frequency emphasis in the spectrum. However, relatively little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms that facilitate these “metaphors we listen with.” Do they originate in universal mental representations common to more than one sensory modality? Triangulating three different interaction paradigms, we investigated using speeded identification whether unimodal and crossmodal interference occurs when timbral brightness, as modelled by the centroid of the spectral envelope, and 1) pitch height, 2) visual brightness, 3) numerical value processing are semantically incongruent. In three online pilot tasks, 58 participants were presented a baseline stimulus (a pitch, gray square, or numeral) then asked to quickly identify a target stimulus that is higher/lower, brighter/darker, or greater/less than the baseline, respectively, after being primed with a bright or dark synthetic harmonic tone. Additionally, in the pitch and visual tasks, a deceptive same-target condition was included. Results suggest that timbral brightness modulates the perception of pitch and visual brightness, but not numerical value. Semantically incongruent pitch height-timbral brightness shifts produced significantly slower choice reaction time and higher error compared to congruent pairs; timbral brightness also had a strong biasing effect in the same-target condition (i.e., people heard the same pitch as higher when the target tone was timbrally brighter than the baseline, and vice versa with darker tones). In the visual task, incongruent pairings of gray squares and tones elicited slower choice reaction times than congruent pairings. No interference was observed in the number comparison task. We are currently following up on these results with a larger online replication sample, and an fMRI study to investigate the relevant neural mechanisms. Our findings shed light on the multisensory nature of experiencing timbre.},
