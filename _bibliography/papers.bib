  Abstract={A Cramér-type moderate deviation theorem quantifies the relative errorof the tail probability approximation. It provides a criterion whether the lim-iting tail probability can be used to estimate the tail probability under study.Chen, Fang and Shao (2013) obtained a general Cramér-type moderate resultusing Stein’s method when the limiting was a normal distribution. In this pa-per, Cramér-type moderate deviation theorems are established for nonnormalapproximation under a general Stein identity, which is satisfied via the ex-changeable pair approach and Stein’s coupling. In particular, a Cramér-typemoderate deviation theorem is obtained for the general Curie–Weiss modeland the imitative monomer-dimer mean-field model.}

  Abstract={
      An exchangeable pair approach is commonly taken in the normal and nonnormal approximation using Stein’s method. It has been successfully used to identify the limiting distribution and provide an error of approximation. However, when the difference of the exchangeable pair is not bounded by a small deterministic constant, the error bound is often not optimal. In this paper, using the exchangeable pair approach of Stein’s method, a new Berry–Esseen bound for an arbitrary random variable is established without a bound on the difference of the exchangeable pair. An optimal convergence rate for normal and nonnormal approximation is achieved when the result is applied to various examples including the quadratic forms, general Curie–Weiss model, mean field Heisenberg model and colored graph model.

  Abstract = {A general exchange pair approach is developed to identify the limiting distribution for any sequence of random variables, by calculating the conditional mean and the conditional second moments. The error of approximation is also studied. In particular, a Berry-Esseen type bound of O(n (-3/4)) is obtained for the Curie-Weiss model at the critical temperature.}
