  title={Heterogeneous Beliefs, Risk Amplification, and Asset Returns},
  author={Goutham, Gopalakrishna and Seung Joo, Lee and Theofanis, Papamichalis},
  abstract={How do heterogeneous beliefs about growth prospects affect the macroeconomyâ€™s endogenous volatility and transition dynamics? We first set out a tractable framework that incorporates heterogeneous beliefs about technological growth, and assess their impact on the amplification of risks during crises. When productive experts become more optimistic about their growth prospects, trade is facilitated, raising investment, asset prices, and leverage ratio considerably. However, when the economy transitions into a crisis, belief heterogeneity exacerbates aggregate risk, resulting in excess volatility and higher risk-premium. The economy ends up spending a longer time in crises on average. Finally, our model generates the excess conditional asset return momentum which is empirically observed during crises and raises the pricing power in the cross-section of asset returns significantly, beyond the conventional factors proposed by the literature.},

  title={ALIENs and Continuous Time Economies},
  author={Goutham, Gopalakrishna},
  abstract={I develop a new computational framework called Actively Learned and Informed Equilibrium Nets (ALIENs) to solve continuous time economic models with endogenous state variables and highly non-linear policy functions. I employ neural networks that are trained to solve supervised learning problems that respect the laws governed by the economic system in the form of general parabolic partial differential equations. The economic information is encoded as regularizers that disciplines the deep neural network in the learning process. The sub-domain of the high dimensional state space that carries the most economic information is learned actively in an iterative loop, enforcing the random training points to be sampled from areas that matter the most to ensure convergence. I utilize a state-of-the art distributed framework to train the network that speeds up computation time significantly. The method is applied to successfully solve a model of macro-finance that is notoriously difficult to handle using traditional finite difference schemes.},

	title={A Macro-Finance model with Realistic Crisis Dynamics},
	author={Goutham, Gopalakrishna},
	abstract={Financial recessions are typically characterized by a large risk premium and a slow recovery. However, macro-finance models have trouble quantitatively explaining these empirical features, especially when they are calibrated to simultaneously match both the observed unconditional and conditional macroeconomic and asset pricing moments. In this paper, I build a macro-finance model that quantitatively explains the salient features of a financial crisis, such as a large drop in output, a spike in the risk premium, reduced financial intermediation, and a long duration of economic distress. The model has leveraged intermediaries with stochastic productivity and a state-dependent exit rate that governs the transition into and out of a crisis. A model without these two features suffers from a trade-off between the amplification and persistence of crisis. I show that my model resolves this tension and generates realistic crisis dynamics.},
