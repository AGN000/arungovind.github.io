  title={Power Decarbonization in a Global Energy Market: The Climate Effect of U.S. LNG Exports},
  abstract={Investment in clean power depends on the price of internationally traded fossil fuels. To what extent can major fossil fuel exporters like the U.S. influence global electricity decarbonization through their trade policy? To answer this question, I build and estimate a multi-country dynamic model of investment in power assets.  In the model, the carbon intensity of electricity production is determined by the entry and exit of power plants using alternative fuels (coal, natural gas, or renewables), and the local price of fossil fuel inputs is determined in a global trade equilibrium. I use the model to analyze the climate effects of building all U.S. liquified natural gas (LNG) export terminals currently seeking federal approval, which would double U.S. export capacity by 2030.  Preliminary results show an absolute decrease in comulative emissions up to 2060 in response to the shock, driven by an increase in the local price of natural gas in the U.S. that incentivizes lower gas generation capacity build-out and higher long-term adoption of renewable energy sources. In the rest of the world, the shock exhibits varying effects across space and time: initial short-term emission reductions in coal-intensive power markets are later offset by a widespread reduction in renewable adoption. By 2055, annual emission reductions in the U.S. are almost completely offset by the increase in emissions in the rest of the world.},

  title={Firm-to-firm Barganing in Domestic Networks (3rd year paper, joint with Anhua Chen and Federico Huneeus)},
  abstract={How do foreign input shocks affect the prices and markups negotiated within a network of domestic firms? We study this question by combining detailed firm transaction data from Chile with an industry equilibrium model of price-setting in the presence of two-sided market power. We first document patterns on the relationship between bilateral supplier and buyer shares and prices in firm-to-firm transaction networks. Suppliers charge lower prices to their largest buyers, and input buyers receive higher prices from their key suppliers. To understand the equilibrium effects of an international trade shock on a domestic network, we perform empirical simulations on a network that replicates the main features of the Chilean economy and behaves under the price-setting assumptions of our model. We find that, in the face of a 16% simulated increase in foreign input costs, the markups of domestic inputs increase by 1.2% on average. This average increase masks significant heterogeneity across input suppliers, with small but dedicated input domestic suppliers increasing their markups by almost twice as much as the average response.},

  title = {Does it matter where and what I study? Evidence from the oil price crash in Canada (joint with Pascuel Plotkin)},
  abstract = {We estimate the impact of a labour demand shock on Canadian recently graduated bachelor students. We leverage a unique Canadian administrative data that features links between individuals post-secondary education and their tax-files. We estimate that a standard deviation increase in school-major specific labour demand, increased earnings immediately in a magnitude between 2.3 and 2.6 log points, with persistent and increasing effects throughout the oil shock. Additionally, the labour demand shock had effects on other labour market outcomes such as unemployment or self-employment. In terms of schooling, school-major specific labour demand had a positive effect on dropouts, which remarks the importance of considering the outside option of students when studying school enrollment.},
