  title={Effects of radiative heat and magnetic field on blood flow in an inclined tapered stenosed porous artery},
  author={Abubakar, JU and Adeoye, AD},
  abstract={A porous tapered inclined stenosed artery under the influence of magnetic field with radiation was considered. The momentum and energy equations with thin radiation governing the blood flow in the inclined artery were obtained taking the flow to be Newtonian. These equations were simplified under assumptions of mild stenosis, non-dimensionalized and solved using Differential Transform Method (DTM). The DTM were coded on Mathematica software to obtain expressions for velocity, temperature and the volumetric flow rate of the blood. The results presented graphically show that the velocity of the blood flow and the blood temperature decreases as the radiation parameter (N) increases.},
