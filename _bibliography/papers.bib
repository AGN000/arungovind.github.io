  abstract={Quantum Dot Cellular Automata (QCA) technology is one of the emerging next-generation nano-scale technologies, to subdue the limitations of existing CMOS technologies. As researchers continue to work hard to find an alternative to CMOS technology, QCA provides a solution for a faster computer with a smaller size and low power consumption. This paper implements an operation-rich “HACK ALU”, capable of performing many operations. Hack AL U is a versatile design that implements 64 op-erations with just 6 control bits along with novel implementations of adders and multiplexers. This ALU has been designed using a bottom-up approach by beginning the design by constructing the basic gates and progressing to the construction of adders, and multiplexers. The scope of the research is to provide an efficient ALU design that can be integrated in the CPU design. The present work has been implemented and tested on the QCA designer software. Experimental evaluation shows that logical and arithmetic operations are consistent in the proposed design.},

  title={Prospects of NFMD for Power System Frequency
and Amplitude Estimation},
 author={Aadharsh Aadhithya A, Neethu Mohan, Sachin Kumar S, Soman K.P, Prabhaharan Poornachandran},
  abstract={ Power quality monitoring and parameter estima-
tion are essential for the proper functioning of modern power
grids. Various techniques have been proposed to estimate the
characteristics of power signals and to gain insight into their
dynamics. Non-stationary Fourier mode decomposition (NFMD)
is a new interpretable time-frequency analysis framework for
non-stationary and nonlinear signals. This work investigates
the prospects of NFMD in the estimation of power-system
characteristics such as fundamental frequency, amplitude and
presence of disturbance components. Usage of NFMD as a noise
removal technique is also explored in the current work. Results
show that NFMD is robust to noisy disturbances and can perform
well in noisy environments. The proposed methodology can be
used for real-time analysis and interpretation of large volume of
data from advanced smart metering techniques such as micro-
phasor measurement units in microgrids},
