	abstract = {Background and Objectives People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are a vulnerable group for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), particularly those taking immunosuppressive disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). We examined the characteristics of COVID-19 severity in an international sample of people with MS.Methods Data from 12 data sources in 28 countries were aggregated (sources could include patients from 1{\textendash}12 countries). Demographic (age, sex), clinical (MS phenotype, disability), and DMT (untreated, alemtuzumab, cladribine, dimethyl fumarate, glatiramer acetate, interferon, natalizumab, ocrelizumab, rituximab, siponimod, other DMTs) covariates were queried, along with COVID-19 severity outcomes, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need for artificial ventilation, and death. Characteristics of outcomes were assessed in patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, MS phenotype, and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score.Results Six hundred fifty-seven (28.1\%) with suspected and 1,683 (61.9\%) with confirmed COVID-19 were analyzed. Among suspected plus confirmed and confirmed-only COVID-19, 20.9\% and 26.9\% were hospitalized, 5.4\% and 7.2\% were admitted to ICU, 4.1\% and 5.4\% required artificial ventilation, and 3.2\% and 3.9\% died. Older age, progressive MS phenotype, and higher disability were associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. Compared to dimethyl fumarate, ocrelizumab and rituximab were associated with hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.56, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.01{\textendash}2.41; aOR 2.43, 95\% CI 1.48{\textendash}4.02) and ICU admission (aOR 2.30, 95\% CI 0.98{\textendash}5.39; aOR 3.93, 95\% CI 1.56{\textendash}9.89), although only rituximab was associated with higher risk of artificial ventilation (aOR 4.00, 95\% CI 1.54{\textendash}10.39). Compared to pooled other DMTs, ocrelizumab and rituximab were associated with hospitalization (aOR 1.75, 95\% CI 1.29{\textendash}2.38; aOR 2.76, 95\% CI 1.87{\textendash}4.07) and ICU admission (aOR 2.55, 95\% CI 1.49{\textendash}4.36; aOR 4.32, 95\% CI 2.27{\textendash}8.23), but only rituximab was associated with artificial ventilation (aOR 6.15, 95\% CI 3.09{\textendash}12.27). Compared to natalizumab, ocrelizumab and rituximab were associated with hospitalization (aOR 1.86, 95\% CI 1.13{\textendash}3.07; aOR 2.88, 95\% CI 1.68{\textendash}4.92) and ICU admission (aOR 2.13, 95\% CI 0.85{\textendash}5.35; aOR 3.23, 95\% CI 1.17{\textendash}8.91), but only rituximab was associated with ventilation (aOR 5.52, 95\% CI 1.71{\textendash}17.84). Associations persisted on restriction to confirmed COVID-19 cases. No associations were observed between DMTs and death. Stratification by age, MS phenotype, and EDSS score found no indications that DMT associations with COVID-19 severity reflected differential DMT allocation by underlying COVID-19 severity.Discussion Using the largest cohort of people with MS and COVID-19 available, we demonstrated consistent associations of rituximab with increased risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, and need for artificial ventilation and of ocrelizumab with hospitalization and ICU admission. Despite the cross-sectional design of the study, the internal and external consistency of these results with prior studies suggests that rituximab/ocrelizumab use may be a risk factor for more severe COVID-19.aOR=adjusted OR; BMI=body mass index; CI=confidence interval; COVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019; DMT=disease-modifying therapy; EDSS=Expanded Disability Status Scale; ICU=intensive care unit; MS=multiple sclerosis; MSDA=MS Data Alliance; OR=odds ratio; RRMS=relapsing-remitting MS; SARS-CoV-2=severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2},

Small dedicated interdisciplinary task forces were created to speed-up the formulation of the study design and work plan. First step was to agree upon a COVID-19 MS core data set. Second, we worked on providing a user-friendly and rapid pipeline to share COVID-19 data at a global scale.Results:The COVID-19 MS core data set was agreed within 48 hours. To date, 23 data collection partners are involved and the first data imports have been performed successfully. Data processing and analysis is an on-going process.Conclusions:We reached a consensus on a core data set and established data sharing processes with multiple partners to address an urgent need for information to guide clinical practice. First results show that partners are motivated to share data to attain the ultimate joint goal: better understand the effect of COVID-19 in PwMS. }

  abstract = {Background: As the COVID-19 pandemic amplifies, efforts to minimise the risk on vulnerable people are essential. People with multiple sclerosis (MS) may be a vulnerable group due to the high proportion taking long-term immunosuppressive disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). Studies from Italy and France suggest older age, higher disability and progressive MS are associated with severe COVID-19, yet there remains uncertainty around the influence of DMTs.
  Objectives: Given the many approved MS DMTs and the relatively low frequency of COVID-19 in MS patients per country, international data sharing is desirable to examine the impact of DMTs on COVID-19 severity. Here, we present the first results of the COVID-19 in MS global data sharing initiative of the MS International Federation and MS Data Alliance and many other data partners to inform MS clinical management during the COVID-19 pandemic.
  Methods: Clinician-reported data from 21 countries were aggregated into a dataset of 1540 patients. Characteristics of admission to hospital, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), need for artificial ventilation, and death, were assessed in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection using log-binomial regression. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) were calculated adjusting for age, sex, MS type, and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).
  Results: Of 1540 patients, 476 (30.9%) with suspected and 776 (50.4%) with confirmed COVID-19 were included in the analysis. Older age, progressive MS and higher EDSS were associated with higher frequencies of severe outcomes. Anti-CD20 DMTs, ocrelizumab and rituximab, were positively associated with hospital admission (aPRs=1.19 & 1.58), ICU admission (aPRs=3.53 & 4.12), and the need for artificial ventilation (aPRs=3.17 & 7.27) compared to dimethyl fumarate. Higher frequencies of all three outcomes were associated with combined anti-CD20 DMT use compared to all other DMTs (hospitalisation aPR=1.49; ICU aPR=2.55; ventilation aPR=3.05) and compared to natalizumab (hospitalisation aPR=1.99; ICU aPR=2.39; ventilation aPR=2.84). Importantly, associations persisted on restriction to confirmed COVID-19 cases and upon exclusion of each contributing data source in turn. No associations were observed between DMTs and death.
  Conclusions: This study used the largest federated international cohort of people with MS and COVID19 currently available. We demonstrate a consistent association of anti-CD20 DMTs with hospitalisation, ICU admission and use of artificial ventilation suggesting their use among MS patients at risk for COVID-19 exposure may be a risk factor for more severe COVID-19 disease. To address study limitations, further research incorporating comorbidities, smoking and body mass index is required. Alternative study designs are needed to address questions on COVID-19 susceptibility among people with MS.},

  abstract = {Background:
  As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, evidencebased clinical guidance for managing the care of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) is an ongoing concern. In recent months, data from cohorts of people with MS has indicated that certain demographic and clinical characteristics, including use of some disease- modifying therapies (DMTs), leads to worse outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection. The COVID-19 in MS global data sharing initiative, which now includes over 4,500 confirmed COVID- 19 cases in people with MS, gives the opportunity to corroborate previous findings with greater certainty.
  Methods:
  Clinician-reported data from 32 countries were aggregated into a dataset of 5,543 patients who had suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Demographic and clinical covariates were queried, alongside COVID-19 clinical severity outcomes. These outcomes (hospitalisation, admission to ICU, requiring artificial ventilation, and death) were assessed in patients with suspected/ confirmed COVID-19 using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression. All models were corrected for age, sex, EDSS, and MS type. DMTs were individually compared to glatiramer acetate (GA), as well as to pooled other DMTs and natalizumab.
  Results:
  Of 5,543 patients in the clinician-reported dataset, 909 with suspected and 4,634 with confirmed COVID-19 were included in the analysis. Previous demographic findings were confirmed male sex, older age, progressive MS, and higher disability were associated with worse outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Use of anti-CD20 DMTs (ocrelizumab and rituximab) was associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. Compared to GA, ocrelizumab and rituximab were associated with increased risk of hospitalisation (aOR=1.61(95%CI=1.06-2.43);aOR=2.42(95%CI=1.54-3.81) and ICU admission (aOR=3.13(95%CI=1.22-8.00);aOR=4.46 (95%CI=1.64-12.09)). Rituximab was associated with increased risk of artificial ventilation (aOR=3.57(95%CI=1.38-9.20));ocrelizumab showed a positive trend (aOR=1.86(95%CI=0.76-4.55). Rituximab showed a positive trend with increased risk of death (aOR=2.74(95%CI=0.68-11.09). Associations persisted on restriction to confirmed COVID-19 cases.
  Conclusions:
  Analysing the largest international real world dataset of people with MS who have suspected or confirmed COVID- 19 confirms previous findings that male sex, older age, progressive MS, higher disability, the use of anti-CD20 medication (ocrelizumab and rituximab) are associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes.

  abstract = {Background:
  One of the major objectives of the Multiple Sclerosis Data Alliance (MSDA) is to enable better discovery of multiple sclerosis (MS) real-world data (RWD).
  Methods:
  We implemented the MSDA Catalogue, which is available worldwide. The current version of the MSDA Catalogue collects descriptive information on governance, purpose, inclusion criteria, procedures for data quality control, and how and which data are collected, including the use of e-health technologies and data on collection of COVID-19 variables. The current cataloguing procedure is performed in several manual steps, securing an effective catalogue.
  Results:
  Herein we summarize the status of the MSDA Catalogue as of January 6, 2021. To date, 38 data sources across five continents are included in the MSDA Catalogue. These data sources differ in purpose, maturity, and variables collected, but this landscaping effort shows that there is substantial alignment on some domains. The MSDA Catalogue shows that personal data and basic disease data are the most collected categories of variables, whereas data on fatigue measurements and cognition scales are the least collected in MS registries/cohorts.
  Conclusions:The Web-based MSDA Catalogue provides strategic overview and allows authorized end users to browse metadata profiles of data cohorts and data sources. There are many existing and arising RWD sources in MS. Detailed cataloguing of MS RWD is a first and useful step toward reducing the time needed to discover MS RWD sets and promoting collaboration.},

Interferon-β, a disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for MS, may be associated with less severe COVID-19 in people with MS.
Results
Among 5,568 patients (83.4% confirmed COVID-19), interferon-treated patients had lower risk of severe COVID-19 compared to untreated, but not to glatiramer-acetate, dimethyl-fumarate, or pooled other DMTs.
Conclusions
In comparison to other DMTs, we did not find evidence of protective effects of interferon-β on the severity of COVID-19, though compared to the untreated, the course of COVID19 was milder among those on interferon-β. This study does not support the use of interferon-β as a treatment to reduce COVID-19 severity in MS.}
