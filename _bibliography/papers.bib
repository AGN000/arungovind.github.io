  abstract={Theory suggests that new market entrants play a special role for the creation of new technological pathways required for the development and diffusion of more sustainable forms of
  production, consumption, mobility and housing. Unconstrained by past technological investments, entrants can introduce more radical environmental innovations than incumbent firms
  whose past R&D decisions make them locked into path-dependent trajectories of outdated
  technologies. Yet, little research exists which provides empirical evidence on new ventures’
  role in the technological transition towards decarbonization and dematerialization. This is
  mainly because patenting is rare among start-ups and also no historical track record about
  their R&D investments exists, both data sources commonly used to determine a company’s
  technological footprint. To enable the identification of clean technology-oriented market entrants and to better understand their role as adopters and innovators for sustainable market
  solutions, this paper presents a framework that systematically maps new ventures’ business
  models to a set of well-defined clean technologies. For this purpose, the framework leverages
  textual descriptions of new entrants’ business summaries that are typically available upon
  business registration and allow for a good indication of their technological orientation. Furthermore, the framework uses textual information from patenting activities of established
  innovators to model semantic representations of technologies. Mapping company and technology descriptions into a common vector space enables the derivation of a fine-granular measure of entrants’ technological orientation. Applying the framework to a survey of German
  start-up firms suggests that clean technology-oriented market entrants act as accelerators of
  technical change: both by virtue of their existing products and services and through a high
  propensity to introduce additional environmental innovations.},

  abstract={Usually, official and survey-based statistics guide policymakers in their choice of response instruments to economic crises. However, in an early phase, after a sudden and unforeseen shock has caused unexpected and fast-changing dynamics, data from traditional statistics are only available with non-negligible time delays. This leaves policymakers uncertain about how to most effectively manage their economic countermeasures to support businesses, especially when they need to respond quickly, as in the COVID-19 pandemic. Given this information deficit, we propose a framework that guided policymakers throughout all stages of this unforeseen economic shock by providing timely and reliable sources of firm-level data as a basis to make informed policy decisions. We do so by combining early stage ‘ad hoc' web analyses, ‘follow-up' business surveys, and ‘retrospective' analyses of firm outcomes. A particular focus of our framework is on assessing the early effects of the pandemic, using highly dynamic and large-scale data from corporate websites. Most notably, we show that textual references to the coronavirus pandemic published on a large sample of company websites and state-of-the-art text analysis methods allowed to capture the heterogeneity of the pandemic's effects at a very early stage and entailed a leading indication on later movements in firm credit ratings. While the proposed framework is specific to the COVID-19 pandemic, the integration of results obtained from real-time online sources in the design of subsequent surveys and their value in forecasting firm-level outcomes typically targeted by policy measures, is a first step towards a more timely and holistic approach for policy guidance in times of economic shocks.},

  abstract={COVID-19 placed a special role on fiscal policy in rescuing companies short of liquidity from insolvency. In the first months of the crisis, SMEs as the backbone of Germany's economy benefited from large and mainly indiscriminate aid measures. Avoiding business failures in a whatever-it-takes fashion contrasts, however, with the cleansing mechanism of economic crises: a mechanism which forces unviable firms out of the market, thereby reallocating resources efficiently. By focusing on firms' pre-crisis financial standing, we estimate the extent to which the policy response induced an insolvency gap and analyze whether the gap is characterized by firms which were already struggling before the pandemic. With the policy measures being focused on smaller firms, we also examine whether this insolvency gap differs with respect to firm size. Our results show that the COVID-19 policy response in Germany has triggered a backlog of insolvencies that is particularly pronounced among financially weak, small firms, having potential long-term implications on entrepreneurship and economic recovery.},
