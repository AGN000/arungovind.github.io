  abstract = {We model the uncorrelated production of double quarkonium ({$\gamma$} and J/{$\psi$} mesons) in Pb+Pb collisions at {\textsurd}sNN= 5.02 TeV through implementation of a standard Monte Carlo Glauber model and a Monte Carlo particle production simulation, PYTHIA 8.306. A multinomial model, using probabilities obtained from relevant literature as well as from a PYTHIA simulation, was used to obtain estimates of double quarkonium yields corresponding to an integrated luminosity of L =1.7nb-1 collected by CMS in the 2018 PbPb run. Distributions from PYTHIA for the {$\gamma$} and J/{$\psi$} mesons and their daughter muons were used to calculate acceptance, and muon efficiencies were obtained from studies done in CMS. Estimates of the probability of production for the {$\gamma$} and J/{$\psi$} mesons were made from these values. The estimates of double quarkonium production can be used for comparison to future measurements to be performed at the CMS detector. Funded by the NSF through the REU program.},

  abstract     = {Differential measurements of Higgs boson production in the \( \tau \)-lepton-pair decay channel are presented in the gluon fusion, vector-boson fusion (VBF), \( VH \) and \( t\bar{t}H \) associated production modes, with particular focus on the VBF production mode. The data used to perform the measurements correspond to 140 fb\(^{-1}\) of proton-proton collisions collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. Two methods are used to perform the measurements: the Simplified Template Cross-Section (STXS) approach and an Unfolded Fiducial Differential measurement considering only the VBF phase space. For the STXS measurement, events are categorized by their production mode and kinematic properties such as the Higgs boson's transverse momentum (\( p_\text{T}^\text{H} \)), the number of jets produced in association with the Higgs boson, or the invariant mass of the two leading jets (\( m_{jj} \)). For the VBF production mode, the ratio of the measured cross-section to the Standard Model prediction for \( m_{jj} > 1.5 \) TeV and \( p_\text{T}^\text{H} > 200 \) GeV (\( p_\text{T}^\text{H} < 200 \) GeV) is \( 1.29^{+0.39}_{-0.34} \) (\( 0.12^{+0.34}_{-0.33} \)). This is the first VBF measurement for the higher-\( p_\text{T}^\text{H} \) criteria, and the most precise for the lower-\( p_\text{T}^\text{H} \) criteria. The fiducial cross-section measurements, which only consider the kinematic properties of the event, are performed as functions of variables characterizing the VBF topology, such as the signed \( \Delta\phi_{jj} \) between the two leading jets. The measurements have a precision of 30\%-50\% and agree well with the Standard Model predictions. These results are interpreted in the SMEFT framework, and place the strongest constraints to date on the CP-odd Wilson coefficient \( c_{H\tilde{W}} \).},
