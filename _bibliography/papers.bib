  title={Estimating Nursing Home Quality with Selection},
  author={Olenski, Andrew and Sacher, Szymon},
  journal={Available at SSRN},
  note={Revise and Resubmit at Review of Economics and Statistics},
  year={2022},
  abstract={We estimate a mortality-based Bayesian model of nursing home quality accounting for selection. We then conduct three exercises. First, we examine the correlates of quality, and find that public report cards have near-zero correlation. Second, we show that higher quality nursing homes fared better during the pandemic: a one standard deviation increase in quality corresponds to 2.5% fewer Covid-19 cases. Finally, we show that a 10% increase in the Medicaid reimbursement rate raises quality, leading to a 1.85 percentage point increase in 90-day survival. Such a reform would be cost-effective under conservative estimates of the quality-adjusted statistical value of life.},

    Verse 1:
In a nursing home, where the old folks stay
There's a quality that's hard to measure
But Olenski and Sacher found a way
To estimate it with a Bayesian treasure

Chorus:
Estimating nursing home quality,
Accounting for selection,
With a mortality-based model,
It's a statistical sensation

Verse 2:
They examined the correlates of quality,
And found that public report cards were poor
But higher quality homes did well in the pandemic,
With fewer Covid cases, oh what a score!

Chorus:
Estimating nursing home quality,
Accounting for selection,
With a mortality-based model,
It's a statistical sensation

Bridge:
A 10% increase in Medicaid reimbursement,
Raises quality, and improves survival,
It's cost-effective, and a life-saver,
Thanks to Olenski and Sacher.

Chorus:
Estimating nursing home quality,
Accounting for selection,
With a mortality-based model,
It's a statistical sensation.},

  title={Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for Regression with High-Dimensional Categorical Data},
  author={Sacher, Szymon and Battaglia, Laura and Hansen, Stephen},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.08112},
  year={2021},
  note={},
  published={false},
  abstract={Latent variable models are becoming increasingly popular in economics for high-dimensional categorical data such as text and surveys. Often the resulting low-dimensional representations are plugged into downstream econometric models that ignore the statistical structure of the upstream model, which presents serious challenges for valid inference. We show how Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) implemented with parallelized automatic differentiation provides a computationally efficient, easy-to-code, and statistically robust solution for this problem. Via a series of applications, we show that modeling integrated structure can non-trivially affect inference and that HMC appears to markedly outperform current approaches to inference in integrated models.},

    Verse 1:
Modeling high-dimensional data,
It's a challenge that we must embrace,
But with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo,
We can find a better place

Chorus:
HMC for regression,
With high-dimensional data,
It's computationally efficient,
And statistically robust, oh mate-a

Verse 2:
Ignoring the statistical structure,
Can lead to faulty inference,
But with HMC, we can model integrated structure,
And improve our confidence

Chorus:
HMC for regression,
With high-dimensional data,
It's computationally efficient,
And statistically robust, oh mate-a

Bridge:
Thanks to Sacher, Battaglia, and Hansen,
For showing us the way,
With their research on HMC,
We can learn more every day.

Chorus:
HMC for regression,
With high-dimensional data,
It's computationally efficient,
And statistically robust, oh mate-a.

  title={Frontiers: The Persuasive Effect of Fox News: Noncompliance with Social Distancing During the COVID-19 Pandemic},
  author={Simonov, Andrey and Sacher, Szymon and Dube, Jean-Pierre and Biswas, Shirsho},
  journal={Marketing Science},
  abstract={To what extent do mass media outlets influence viewers' trust in scientific evidence and compliance with behavior recommended by scientific experts? Exploiting the U.S. lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, we analyze a large longitudinal database that combines daily stay-at-home behavior from approximately 8 million mobile phones and local viewership of cable news networks. Early in the pandemic, several of Fox News' hosts downplayed the severity of the pandemic and the risks associated with the transmission of the virus. A combination of regression analysis and a natural experiment finds that a 10% increase in viewership of Fox News in a zip code causes a 0.76-percentage-point reduction in compliance with stay-at-home behavior. The results imply a media persuasion rate that is larger than typical advertising persuasion rates on consumer behavior. Similar analyses using viewership of MSNBC and CNN, which supported lockdown measures, were inconclusive but suggested a smaller, positive effect on compliance with social distancing regulations.},

    Verse 1:
    Fox News is on the air
    Spreading fear and doubt everywhere
    Ignoring the facts, turning science upside down
    Peddling lies to keep the people in a bind

    Chorus:
    The persuasive effect of Fox News
    Manipulating minds and causing chaos
    Noncompliance with social distancing rules
    Spreading the virus, breaking the rules

    Verse 2:
    Simonov, Andrey, and Sacher, Szymon
    Exposing the truth with their research on
    The power of media to influence trust
    In the face of a pandemic, it's a must

    Chorus:
    The persuasive effect of Fox News
    Manipulating minds and causing chaos
    Noncompliance with social distancing rules
    Spreading the virus, breaking the rules

    Bridge:

    Fox News's downplaying of the pandemic
    Causing a decrease in compliance with the rules

    Chorus:
    The persuasive effect of Fox News
    Manipulating minds and causing chaos
    Noncompliance with social distancing rules
    Spreading the virus, breaking the rules

    Outro:
    Fox News, a dangerous force
    Ignoring science, making things worse
    But we won't be swayed by their lies
    We'll follow the rules and stay alive.
