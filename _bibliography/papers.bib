  title={Multiple Sex- and Circuit-Specific Mechanisms Underlie Exercise-Induced Stress Resistance},
  author={Tanner MK, Mellert SM, Fallon IP, Baratta MV, Greenwood BN},
  abstract={Prior physical activity reduces the risk of future stress-related mental health disorders including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Rodents allowed to engage in voluntary wheel running are similarly protected from behavioral consequences of stress. The present review summarizes current knowledge on mechanisms underlying exercise-induced stress resistance. A conceptual framework involving the development (during exercise) and expression (during stress) of stress resistance from exercise is proposed. During the development of stress resistance, adaptations involving multiple exercise signals and molecular mediators occur within neural circuits orchestrating various components of the stress response, which then respond differently to stress during the expression of stress resistance. Recent data indicate that the development and expression of stress resistance from exercise involve multiple independent mechanisms that depend on sex, stressor severity, and behavioral outcome. Recent insight into the role of the prefrontal cortex in exercise-induced stress resistance illustrates these multiple mechanisms. This knowledge has important implications for the design of future experiments aimed at identifying the mechanisms underlying exercise-induced stress resistance.},

  title={The role of the parafascicular thalamic nucleus in action initiation and steering},
  author={Fallon IP, Hughes RN, Severino FPU, Kim N, Lawry CM, Watson GDR, Roschina M, Yin HH},
  abstract={The parafascicular (Pf) nucleus of the thalamus has been implicated in arousal and attention, but its contributions to behavior remain poorly characterized. Here, using in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology, optogenetics, and 3D motion capture, we studied the role of the Pf nucleus in behavior using a continuous reward-tracking task in freely moving mice. We found that many Pf neurons precisely represent vector components of velocity, with a strong preference for ipsiversive movements. Their activity usually leads velocity, suggesting that Pf output is critical for self-initiated orienting behavior. To test this hypothesis, we expressed excitatory or inhibitory opsins in VGlut2+ Pf neurons to manipulate neural activity bidirectionally. We found that selective optogenetic stimulation of these neurons consistently produced ipsiversive head turning, whereas inhibition stopped turning and produced downward movements. Taken together, our results suggest that the Pf nucleus can send continuous top-down commands that specify detailed action parameters (e.g., direction and speed of the head), thus providing guidance for orienting and steering during behavior.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
