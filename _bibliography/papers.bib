	abstract = {Background Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) via colonoscopy or enema has become a commonly used treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection (CDI).   Aims To compare the safety and preliminary efficacy of orally administered lyophilized microbiota product compared with frozen product by enema.   Methods In a single center, adults with ≥ 3 episodes of recurrent CDI were randomized to receive encapsulated lyophilized fecal microbiota from 100–200 g of donor feces (n = 31) or frozen FMT from 100 g of donor feces (n = 34) by enema. Safety during the three months post FMT was the primary study objective. Prevention of CDI recurrence during the 60 days after FMT was a secondary objective. Fecal microbiome changes were examined in first 39 subjects studied.   Results Adverse experiences were commonly seen in equal frequency in both groups and did not appear to relate to the route of delivery of FMT. CDI recurrence was prevented in 26 of 31 (84%) subjects randomized to capsules and in 30 of 34 (88%) receiving FMT by enema (p = 0.76). Both products normalized fecal microbiota diversity while the lyophilized orally administered product was less effective in repleting Bacteroidia and Verrucomicrobia classes compared to frozen product via enema.   Conclusions The route of delivery, oral or rectal, did not influence adverse experiences in FMT. In preliminary evaluation, both routes appeared to show equivalent efficacy, although the dose may need to be higher for lyophilized product. Spore-forming bacteria appear to be the most important engrafting organisms in FMT by the oral route using lyophilized product.   Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02449174},

	abstract = "{The majority of studies providing insights on the influence of the microbiome on the health of hematologic malignancy patients have concentrated on the transplant setting. Herein, we sought to assess the predictive capacity of the gastrointestinal microbiome and its relationship to clinical outcomes, with a specific focus on infection, in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).16s rRNA based analysis was performed on oral swabs and stool samples obtained biweekly from baseline until neutrophil recovery following induction chemotherapy (IC) in 97 AML patients. Microbiome characteristics were correlated with clinical outcomes both during and after IC completion.At the start of IC, higher stool Shannon diversity (HR, 0.36; 95\\% CI, 0.18-0.74) and higher relative abundance of Porphyromonadaceae (HR, 0.36; 95\\% CI, 0.18-0.73) were associated with increased probability of remaining infection-free during neutropenia. A baseline stool Shannon diversity cut-off of \\&lt;2 had optimal operating characteristics for predicting infectious complications during neutropenia. Although 56 patients received therapy \\&gt;72 hours with a carbapenem, none of the patients had an infection with an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing organism. Patients receiving carbapenems for \\&gt;72hrs prior to neutrophil recovery had significantly lower α-diversity at neutrophil recovery (P=0.001) and were approximately 4 times more likely to have infection in the 90 days following neutrophil recovery (HR, 4.55; 95\\% CI, 1.73-11.93).Our results suggest that gut microbiome evaluation could assist with infectious risk stratification and that improved targeting of antibiotic administration during IC could decrease subsequent infectious complications of AML patients.}",

	abstract = {Background Theoretically, the estrogen deprivation induced by aromatase inhibitors (AIs) might cause ischemic heart disease, but empiric studies have shown mixed results. We aimed to compare AIs and tamoxifen with regard to cardiovascular events among older breast cancer patients outside of clinical trials. We hypothesized that AIs increase the risk of myocardial infarction. Methods We identified women age ≥67 years diagnosed with breast cancer from June 30, 2006 to June 1, 2008 in the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER)-Medicare database, treated with either tamoxifen or an AI, and followed through December 31, 2012. To compare myocardial infarction (MI) risk for the treatment groups of AIs vs tamoxifen, we developed and assigned stabilized probability of treatment weights and used the Fine and Gray model for time to MI with death not related to MI as a competing risk. Results Of the cohort of 5648 women, 4690 were treated with AIs and 958 with tamoxifen; a total of 251 patients developed MI, and 22 patients died of MI during the study period while 476 died of other causes. The hazard for MI was not significantly different between AI vs tamoxifen groups (HR = 1.01, 95\% CI 0.72-1.42), after adjusting for the following known MI risk factors at the start of adjuvant therapy: diabetes, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, MI, and peripheral vascular disease. Conclusions In this SEER-Medicare-based population study, there were no significant differences in the risk of MI between AI and tamoxifen users after adjustment for known risk factors.},
