  abstract={This study shows how soil aridity (proxied with a measure of soil potential evapotranspiration) impacts child wellbeing in Sub-Saharan Africa. Using climate and infant health data from a grid of approximately 4,000 cells in 34 African countries, we find that infants born in arid areas are comparatively more likely to die under the age of 5 and be systematically underweight at birth. In addition, we show how the aridity measure in this study reduces the effect of rainfall on child wellbeing and how aridification drives substantial heterogeneity in the estimated response to increasing precipitation. The findings are combined with model projections of future climate conditions to emphasize the importance of accounting for aridity alongside precipitations when assessing the economic impact of climate.},

  title={"A Spreading Malaise: Manure Management, Air Pollution, and Hospital Admissions in Italy"},
  author={Lunghi, J.},
  abstract={Manure management is a widespread soil fertilization practice in agriculture. Yet, little is known about the environmental and health threats posed by manure application. I estimate the causal effect of manure spreading on fine particulate matter concentrations, as well as respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations, mortality rate at discharge, and treatment costs using air quality and hospital discharge data from the Lombardy region in Italy. I exploit exogenous variation in spreading prohibitions to design a repeated event-study framework. I estimate an increase of around 27% in PM2.5 concentrations in the five days following a ban lift. I detect an increase in urgent hospitalizations, and higher hospital mortality rate during spreading events. Conversely, it is found no significant difference in the cost per hospitalization. Under these premises, I estimate the yearly financial burden of manure spreading to range between 17.22 and 37.14 million euros. Finally, I test the implications of a fully flexible regulatory framework to redistribute emissions over calendar days, which allows to reduce winter days in which PM exceeds hazard levels by 8%.
