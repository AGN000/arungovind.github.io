  abstract = {We present STELAR (Species Tree Estimation by maximizing tripLet AgReement), a new fast and highly accurate statistically consistent coalescent-based method for estimating species trees from a collection of gene trees. We formalized the constrained triplet consensus (CTC) problem and showed that the solution to the CTC problem is a statistically consistent estimate of the species tree under the multi-species coalescent (MSC) model. STELAR is an efficient dynamic programming based solution to the CTC problem which is highly accurate and scalable. We evaluated the accuracy of STELAR in comparison with SuperTriplets, which is an alternate fast and highly accurate triplet-based supertree method, and with MP-EST and ASTRAL – two of the most popular and accurate coalescent-based methods. Experimental results suggest that STELAR matches the accuracy of ASTRAL and improves on MP-EST and SuperTriplets.},

  abstract = {Demand for fast data sharing among smart devices is rapidly increasing. This trend creates challenges towards ensuring essential security for online shared data while maintaining the resource usage at a reasonable level. Existing research studies attempt to leverage compression based encryption for enabling such secure and fast data transmission replacing the traditional resource-heavy encryption schemes. Current compression-based encryption methods mainly focus on error insensitive digital data formats and prone to be vulnerable to different attacks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose and implement a new Huffman compression based Encryption scheme using lightweight dynamic Order Statistic tree (HEliOS) for digital data transmission. The core idea of HEliOS involves around finding a secure encoding method based on a novel notion of Huffman coding, which compresses the given digital data using a small sized "secret" (called as secret_intelligence in our study). HEliOS does this in such a way that, without the possession of the secret intelligence, an attacker will not be able to decode the encoded compressed data. Hence, by encrypting only the small-sized intelligence, we can secure the whole compressed data. Moreover, our rigorous real experimental evaluation for downloading and uploading digital data to and from a personal cloud storage Dropbox server validates efficacy and lightweight nature of HEliOS.}

  title={A Sweet Recipe for Consolidated Vulnerabilities: Attacking a Live Website by Harnessing a Killer Combination of Vulnerabilities for Greater Harm},
  year={2018},
  pages={1-9},
  abstract={Recent emergence of new vulnerabilities is an epoch-making problem in the complex world of website security. Most of the websites are failing to keep updating to tackle their websites from these new vulnerabilities leaving without realizing the weakness of the websites. As a result, when cyber-criminals scour such vulnerable old version websites, the scanner will represent a set of vulnerabilities. Once found, these vulnerabilities are then exploited to steal data, distribute malicious content, or inject defacement and spam content into the vulnerable websites. Furthermore, a combination of different vulnerabilities is able to cause more damages than anticipation. Therefore, in this paper, we endeavor to find connections among various vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting, local file inclusion, remote file inclusion, buffer overflow CSRF, etc. To do so, we develop a Finite State Machine (FSM) attacking model, which analyzes a set of vulnerabilities towards the road to finding connections. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model by applying it to the set of vulnerabilities found on two live websites.},
