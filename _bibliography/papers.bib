	title={Supply Chain Finance and Firm Capital Structure},
	author={Goutham Gopalakrishna, and Laura Bottazzi, and Claudio Tebaldi},
	abstract={We model the joint financial decisions of a bank, a supplier, and their customers when firms have access to a factoring service to support a trade credit agreement. To explore the nexus between firms’ capital structure and the intensity of their financial and productive inter- linkages we develop a structural model that integrates a ’supply chain of credit’ with a model of `downstream competition’ for customers and rationalizes the emergence of the granular networks that shape firms risk exposure. We exploit information from a proprietary dataset to identify a number of empirical regularities that correlate the use of factoring services offered by the bank with customers’ and suppliers’ capital structure determinants.},

  title={Optimism, Net Worth Trap, and Asset Returns},
  author={Goutham Gopalakrishna, and Seung Joo Lee, and Theofanis Papamichalis},
  abstract={How does optimism about growth prospects affect the stability of the macroeconomy and its transition dynamics? We set out a tractable framework that incorporates optimism about long-run growth, and assess its impact on the amplification of boom-bust cycles. When experts become more optimistic about technological growth, trade gets facilitated, raising investment, asset prices, and leverage considerably. However, when the economy transitions into a crisis, optimism exacerbates aggregate risk, resulting in excess volatility and higher risk-premium. In some cases, the experts' expectation error stemming from their optimism generates a  net worth trap, a situation in which the net worth of optimistic experts is trapped at very low levels indefinitely. Our model explains the excess conditional momentum in asset returns, which is empirically observed in crises, and raises the pricing power in the cross-section of asset returns significantly, beyond the conventional factors proposed by the literature.},

  title={ALIENs and Continuous Time Economies},
  author={Goutham Gopalakrishna},
  abstract={I develop a new computational framework called Actively Learned and Informed Equilibrium Nets (ALIENs) to solve continuous time economic models with endogenous state variables and highly non-linear policy functions. I employ neural networks that are trained to solve supervised learning problems that respect the laws governed by the economic system in the form of general parabolic partial differential equations. The economic information is encoded as regularizers that disciplines the deep neural network in the learning process. The sub-domain of the high dimensional state space that carries the most economic information is learned actively in an iterative loop, enforcing the random training points to be sampled from areas that matter the most to ensure convergence. I utilize a state-of-the art distributed framework to train the network that speeds up computation time significantly. The method is applied to successfully solve a model of macro-finance that is notoriously difficult to handle using traditional finite difference schemes.},

	title={A Macro-Finance model with Realistic Crisis Dynamics},
	author={Goutham Gopalakrishna},
	abstract={Financial recessions are typically characterized by a large risk premium and a slow recovery. However, macro-finance models have trouble quantitatively explaining these empirical features, especially when they are calibrated to simultaneously match both the observed unconditional and conditional macroeconomic and asset pricing moments. In this paper, I build a macro-finance model that quantitatively explains the salient features of a financial crisis, such as a large drop in output, a spike in the risk premium, reduced financial intermediation, and a long duration of economic distress. The model has leveraged intermediaries with stochastic productivity and a state-dependent exit rate that governs the transition into and out of a crisis. A model without these two features suffers from a trade-off between the amplification and persistence of crisis. I show that my model resolves this tension and generates realistic crisis dynamics.},
