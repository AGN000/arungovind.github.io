  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={Consider a repeated single item auction with a single buyer who has a value for the item randomly drawn from known distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) each round and bids according to an online learning algorithm. "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09176">Selling to a No-Regret Buyer</a>" by Braverman et al. presents a strategy for the seller which, whenever the buyer bids according to a mean-based learning algorithm, extracts revenue that is arbitrarily close to the expected welfare. We extend these results to two settings where the bidder does not use a simple mean-based learning algorithm. First, we consider a bidder using a mean-based learning algorithm with recency bias, where the results of recent rounds are weighed more strongly. We show how much revenue the strategy yields as a function of the recency bias factor \(\beta\). Next, we consider a bidder using a <i>k</i>-switching learning algorithm, where what we define as a <i>g-mean-based</i> learning algorithm is given as options all "meta-strategies" which switch bids at most <i>k</i> times. We present a new strategy and show how much revenue it yields as a function of the <i>g</i> for which the learning algorithm is <i>g</i>-mean-based. In both settings, we also determine which parameter values allow the algorithm to be no-regret, and which yield revenue that is arbitrarily close to the welfare.},

  abstract={We extend <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09733">Randomized Single Elimination Bracket (RSEB)</a> to tournaments with multiple prizes, creating two new tournament ranking rules: <i>Randomized Complete Bracket (RCB)</i> and <i>Randomized Recursive Bracket (RRC)</i>. We prove various guarantees for manipulability and fairness under these rules. We first show that Randomized Complete Bracket is \(2\)-SNM-\(\frac{1}{2}\) and that both RCB and RRB are \(2\)-SNM-\(\frac{1}{3}\) for a subclass of prize vectors we call <i>Binary Power-of-Two Prize Vectors</i>. We then show that both rules are manipulable under the Borda vector presented in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3490486.3538242">Dale et al.</a> and that neither is cover-consistent or consistent under expectation. Finally, we provide a promising partial proof and empirical results towards showing that Randomized Complete Bracket is \(2\)-SNM-\(\frac{1}{3}\) for all prize vectors.},

  pdf={Exploring the Role of Contextualization in Dynamic Contextualized Word Embeddings.pdf},
  abstract={Contemporary natural language tasks often use embeddings to extract information from text, especially for downstream applications. However, many embedding techniques are non-dynamic, meaning they do not capture extralinguistic context like time and social space. There are techniques that incorporate linguistic context (e.g., large language models like BERT and GPT), and dynamic embeddings can partially incorporate time and social space. We seek to replicate the findings of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12684">Hofmann et al.</a>, who propose Dynamic Contextualized Word Embeddings (DCWEs) as a technique for incorporating both linguistic and extralinguistic context by combining a pretrained contextual language model and a joint model of time and social space. After replicating their findings, we extend their work to a downstream sentiment analysis task in two ways: we consider multiple contextual models (e.g. GPT), and we explore the effect of a dynamic component on non-contextual embeddings created by traditional embeddings systems (e.g. Word2Vec). While we replicate the baseline findings, we find that the addition of DCWE is not beneficial for the other contextual embeddings. Furthermore, non-contextual embeddings performed substantially worse than the baseline.},

We find that popular strains do not have distinct lexical distributions or sentiment values, strains’ parents account for their popularity, and strains named like their parents actually tend to differ in popularity from their parents.},

  abstract={We develop a novel automatic playlist continuation system. We establish a new method of featurizing songs based on vocabulary, structure, orientation, style, and semantics, which we validate using dimensionality reduction (t-SNE). We then train a neural network to determine a pair of songs’ compatibility using Spotify’s 1M playlist dataset, which we compare to cosine similarity. Our final system was 4x more accurate than our benchmark in both recommending one song and in recommending five songs.},
