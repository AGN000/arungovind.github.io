  abstract        = {Cryptocurrency conjures a new form of medium of exchange since the initiation from Nakamoto (2008). However, the unregulated nature of its market, as compared to the norms of traditional money markets, has often made it challenging to shift from hype to hope. This study proposes an empirical framework with 33 time series factors under three major components: functional characteristics, market dynamics, and economic attributes. We assess the definition and evolution of each factor under consideration. With an example of Ethereum, we investigate how these factors relate causally to one another and visualize it by using a Granger causal network.
  In addition, the utilization of Beta-t-EGARCH provides a different resolution to the causal dynamics with long-run and short-run volatility components. Essentially, we note that functional characteristics often serve as the root cause of the  economic attributes. ETH whales, as large holders of the ETH, may potentially benefit from the current inequality in distribution, thus exerting a significant impact on its economic performance.},

  abstract        = {NFTs, or Non Fungible Tokens, have been in the focus of emerging digital asset transactions, have gained a lot of attention of art investors and are among the fastest growing Web 3.0 and crypto products.  The popularity of NFTs has started with a generative art collection —CryptoPunks from Larva Lab in 2017 and the total market capitalization has been over USD 41 billion since 2021.
  We present a short history sketch of this NFT art phenomenon and investigate the properties of CryptoPunks via their flattened pixel vector.  This leads to very high dimensional data, that we represent via modern visualisation techniques, in order to detect clusters and similarities among the digital assets.  Employing the UMAP technique, we are able to attach prices to pictures and pattern elements. The UMAP Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection is explained in detail and compared with other localising techniques like t-SNE. Given the 2-dimensional data from the UMAP, we observe the clusters among these CryptoPunks and then associate them with their prices and traits.},

  abstract        = {Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), blockchain-based digital tokens whose units are designed to be unique, have skyrocketed in popularity since 2021, particularly for contemporary art. Owing to digital proof of ownership on digital artwork but lacking physical collectibles and copyright, one may raise a concern over an acceleration of NFT markets. This study extracts high-dimensional art image patterns and associates the identified image features with the NFT prices to exploit speculative activities. Speculating NFTs leads to a disconnection between the extracted features and the NFT prices. Our approach involves a multi-class classification model on NFTs' price ranges by means of multilayered neural networks. The methodology is functional to the application of existing pixel-wise decomposition techniques of non-linear classifiers. The resulting decomposition provides heatmap visualization of pixels that are the most relevant in the classification decisions and creates a wide room for interpretation of domain experts.},

  abstract        = {Cross-exchange trading induces risk spillover in the crypto market, especially for centralized exchanges, which compound crypto volatility and counterparty risk. We propose a Multivariate Heterogeneous AutoRegression for Crypto Market (MHAR-CM) to specifically investigate interconnectedness among 9 different exchanges on Bitcoin in a high-frequency resolution via dynamic partial correlation networks. MHAR-CM accommodates the stylized facts of Bitcoin, such as trading 24/7 and the long-memory effect on returns. The monthly dependence coefficients of MHAR-CM reflect the evo- lution of Bitcoin returns and the persistent influence of events. We find that the scale of an exchange determines its influence towards the others, and the interconnectedness among these exchanges is stronger during a crisis. We also conclude with some remarks on FTX due to its recent bankruptcy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a portfolio considering the dynamics of partial correlation networks offers a promising result in terms of risk diversification.},

  abstract        = {The big bang of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has caused the birth of a brand new era for digital art. NFTs, driven by blockchain and smart contracts, provide both artists and art collectors an unprece- dented marketplace equipped with more security, flexibility, publicity, and freedom to monetize. Unlike the conventional art market, NFT art market trades works of art in rapid succession and has no sluggish business cycle. Yet, the emergence of such a market has been considered to be packed with speculation and economic uncertainty, given the limited understanding towards this market. To precisely depict the NFT art market and offer a gauge for market volatility, we construct the price index – Digital Art Index (DAI) – using hedonic regression on the top 10 liquid NFT art collections and provide an empirical overview. Due to the common phenomenon of outlying price observations, we propose two innovative alternative procedures – Huberization and DCS-t filtering to create a robust index. Moreover, by considering each artwork’s time-variant and time-invariant characteristics, we are able to investigate price determinants and access the intrinsic value of the market.},

We use distributional charac- teristics such as fourier power spectrum, moments, quantiles, global we optimums, as well as the measures for long term dependencies, risk and noise to summarise the information from crypto time series. With the hypothesis that the blockchain structure explains the distribu- tional characteristics of cryptos, we use characteristic based spectral clustering to cluster the selected cryptos into five groups. We scrutinise these clusters and find that indeed, the clus- ters of cryptos share similar mechanism such as origin of fork, difficulty adjustment frequency, and the nature of block size. This paper provides crypto creators and users with a better un- derstanding toward the connection between the blockchain protocol design and distributional characteristics of cryptos.},

Usually various resources are required to conduct operations and the required resources are usually limited in numbers and availability. Business process models supporting operations management should aid in effectively using available resources, identifying process inefficiencies, and enabling appropriate action if resources are unavailable or cannot operate as required. In this contribution we show how typical resource requirements found in operations management can be included in business process models and propose BPMN 2.0 compatible modelling patterns for describing resource requirements based on the concepts of requests and releases. We discuss various modelling requirements from an operations management perspective and discuss how request-release modelling patterns can be used for different application cases.},

Rule-based allocations can lead to unnecessarily low resource utilization rates, high costs, and large delays. In this paper, we present a framework allowing for optimized resource allocations by extending a traditional Business Process Management System by a new component that we call the Resource Manager. Our framework allows a process designer to specify resource requirements which are used by the Resource Manager to decide on allocations of resources to process activities. We describe the functionality of the Resource Manager, its interaction with the process engine, and the data needed. The framework is implemented by extending an open-source process modeler and engine, and applied to a use case concerning the last mile delivery.},
