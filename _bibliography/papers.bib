  abstract = 	 {We introduce MosAIc, an interactive web app that allows users to find pairs of semantically related artworks that span different cultures, media, and millennia. To create this application, we introduce Conditional Image Retrieval (CIR) which combines visual similarity search with user supplied filters or “conditions”. This technique allows one to find pairs of similar images that span distinct subsets of the image corpus. We provide a generic way to adapt existing image retrieval data-structures to this new domain and provide theoretical bounds on our approach’s efficiency. To quantify the performance of CIR systems, we introduce new datasets for evaluating CIR methods and show that CIR performs non-parametric style transfer. Finally, we demonstrate that our CIR data-structures can identify “blind spots” in Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) where they fail to properly model the true data distribution.},

abstract={Digital devices are the essential building blocks of any modern electronic system. Fibres containing digital devices could enable fabrics with digital system capabilities for applications in physiological monitoring, human-computer interfaces, and on-body machine-learning. Here, a scalable preform-to-fibre approach is used to produce tens of metres of flexible fibre containing hundreds of interspersed, digital temperature sensors and memory devices with a memory density of {\textasciitilde}7.6{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}105 bits per metre. The entire ensemble of devices are individually addressable and independently operated through a single connection at the fibre edge, overcoming the perennial single-fibre single-device limitation and increasing system reliability. The digital fibre, when incorporated within a shirt, collects and stores body temperature data over multiple days, and enables real-time inference of wearer activity with an accuracy of 96{\%} through a trained neural network with 1650 neuronal connections stored within the fibre. The ability to realise digital devices within a fibre strand which can not only measure and store physiological parameters, but also harbour the neural networks required to infer sensory data, presents intriguing opportunities for worn fabrics that sense, memorise, learn, and infer situational context.},
