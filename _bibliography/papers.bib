  abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) has seen a great potential to solve many power system problems along with its transition into Smart Grid. Specifically, electric distribution systems have witnessed a rapid integration of distributed energy resources (DERs), including photovoltaic (PV) panels, electric vehicles (EV), and smart appliances, etc. Electricity consumers, equipped with such DERs and advanced metering/sensing/computing devices, are becoming self-interested prosumers who can behave more actively for their electric energy consumption. In this paper, the potential of distributed ML in solving the energy trading problem among prosumers of a future electric distribution system - building DC grid cell, is explored, while considering the limited computation, communication, and data privacy issues of the edge entities. A fully distributed energy trading framework based on ML is proposed to optimize the load and price prediction accuracy and energy trading efficiency. Computation resource allocation, communication schemes, ML task scheduling, as well as user sensitive data preserving issues in the distributed ML framework are addressed with consideration of all the economic and physical constraints of the electric distribution systems.}

  title={Location Privacy Protection in Vehicle-Based Spatial Crowdsourcing via Geo-Indistinguishability}, 
  abstract={Nowadays, vehicles have been increasingly adopted in many spatial crowdsourcing (SC) applications. Similar to other SC applications, location privacy is of great concern to vehicle workers as they are required to disclose their own location to servers to facilitate the service utilities. Traditional location privacy protection mechanisms cannot be applied to vehicle-based SC since they assume workers mobility on a 2-dimensional plane without considering the network-constrained mobility features of vehicles. Accordingly, in this paper, we aim at addressing issues related to Vehicle-based spatial crowdsourcing Location Privacy (VLP) over road networks. Our objective is to design a location obfuscation strategy to minimize the quality loss due to obfuscation with geo-indistinguishability satisfied. Considering the computational complexity of VLP, by resorting to discretization, we first approximate VLP to a linear programming problem that can be solved by well-developed approaches. To further improve the time efficiency, we conduct constraint reduction for VLP by exploiting key features of geo-indistinguishability in road networks and problem decomposition based on VLPs constraint structure. Finally, we carry out both trace-driven simulation and real-world experiments, where our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over a known state-of-the-art location obfuscation strategy in terms of both QoS and privacy.},

  abstract = {To promote cost-effective task assignment in Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC), workers are required to report their location to servers, which raises serious privacy concerns. As a solution, geo-obfuscation has been widely used to protect the location privacy of SC workers, where workers are allowed to report perturbed location instead of the true location. Yet, most existing geo-obfuscation methods consider workers' mobility on a 2 dimensional (2D) plane, wherein workers can move in arbitrary directions. Unfortunately, 2D-based geo-obfuscation is likely to generate high traveling cost for task assignment over roads, as it cannot accurately estimate the traveling costs distortion caused by location obfuscation. In this paper, we tackle the SC worker location privacy problem over road networks. Considering the network-constrained mobility features of workers, we describe workers? mobility by a weighted directed graph, which considers the dynamic traffic condition and road network topology. Based on the graph model, we design a geo-obfuscation (GO) function for workers to maximize the workers? overall location privacy without compromising the task assignment efficiency. We formulate the problem of deriving the optimal GO function as a linear programming (LP) problem. By using the angular block structure of the LP's constraint matrix, we apply Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition to improve the time-efficiency of the GO function generation. Our experimental results in the real-trace driven simulation and the real-world experiment demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of both privacy and task assignment efficiency.},

  abstract = {Always keeping a certain distance between vehicles in a platoon system is important for collision avoidance. Centralized platoon systems let the leader vehicle determine and notify the velocities of all the vehicles in the platoon. Unfortunately, such a centralized method generates high packet drop rate and communication delay due to the leader vehicle's limited communication capability. Therefore, we propose a decentralized platoon network, in which each vehicle determines its velocity by only communicating with the vehicles in a short range. However, the multiple simultaneous transmissions between different pairs of vehicles may interfere with each other. By leveraging a typical feature of a platoon, we devise a channel allocation algorithm, called the Fast and Lightweight Autonomous channel selection algorithm (FLA), in which each vehicle determines its channel simply based on its distance to the leader vehicle. We also devise a strategy, in which a succeeding vehicle uses its stored common velocity profile when it is disconnected from its preceding vehicle and then adjusts its velocity once the connection is built. We conduct experiments on NS-3 and Matlab to evaluate the performance of our proposed methods and implement a real-world prototype by equipping vehicles with Android mobile devices. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our decentralized platoon network over the previous centralized platoon networks.},

  abstract={Many usage-based automotive insurance programs do not directly use any GPS-based location tracking devices. Instead, CAN-bus data, such as brake signal data, can be collected by these programs to evaluate drivers' driving habits and vehicle usage policies. In this paper, we demonstrate that by using a temporal sequence of applied brake signals collected from a vehicle, attackers can still possibly infer the vehicle's route over the period, even though brake signal data does not reveal any specific location information. Our route inference is basically composed of three steps: At first, we categorize brake signal subsequences into four different driving maneuvers (i.e., stopping from a certain speed, reducing speed to adjust with the traffic flow, and taking left and right turns). Second, we estimate the number of intersections traversed by the vehicle using the applied brake signals and their corresponding maneuvers. Particularly, we also estimate the overall speed profile based on the magnitude and interval of different brake signals. From the estimated speed profile, we infer the distances, traveling time, and traffic signs corresponding to the candidate edges. Finally, we design a graph-based route-selection algorithm to find a list of (paths) routes from the regional map using the predicted driving maneuvers and the speed profile. We use a score function based on three factors (i.e., distance, traveling time, and traffic signs) to identify a candidate edge. We evaluate our approach using over 450km of transportation data, which has been collected from 24 individuals. The experimental results demonstrate that, by resorting to our solution, 89% of the original drivers' trajectory can be successfully recovered from their brake data regardless of driver and vehicle models.},

  abstract = {Crowdsourcing leverages the diverse skill sets of large collections of individual contributors to solve problems and execute projects, where contributors may vary significantly in experience, expertise, and interest in completing tasks. Hence, to ensure the satisfaction of its task requesters, most existing crowdsourcing platforms focus primarily on supervisingcontributors' behavior. This lopsided approach to supervision negatively impacts contributor engagement and platform sustainability.In this paper, we introduce rating mechanisms to evaluate requesters' behavior, such that the health and sustainability of crowdsourcing platform can be improved. We build a game theoretical model to systematically account for the different goals of requesters, contributors, and platform, and their interactions. On the basis of this model, we focus on a specific application, in which we aim to design a rating policy that incentivizes requesters to engage lessexperienced contributors. Considering the hardness of the problem, we develop a time efficient heuristic algorithm with theoretical bound analysis. Finally, we conduct a user study in Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to validate the central hypothesis of the model. We provide a simulation based on 3 million task records extracted from MTurk demonstrating that our rating policy can appreciably motivate requesters to hire less-experienced contributors.},

  abstract = {In a crowd market such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, the remuneration of Human Intelligence Tasks is determined by the requester, for which they are not given many cues to ascertain how to "fairly'' pay their workers. Furthermore, the current methods for setting a price are mostly binary -- in that, the worker either gets paid or not -- as opposed to paying workers a "fair'' wage based on the quality and utility of work completed. Instead, the price should better reflect the historical performance of the market and the requirements of the task. In this paper, we introduce a game theoretical model that takes into account a more balanced set of market parameters, and propose a pricing policy and a rating policy to incentivize requesters to offer "fair'' compensation for crowdsourcing workers. We present our findings from applying and developing thismodel on real data gathered from workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk and simulations that we ran to validate our assumptions. Our simulation results also demonstrate that our policies motivate requesters to pay their workers more "fairly'' compared with the payment set by the current market.},

  title={Dynamic Demand Prediction and Allocation in Cloud Service Brokerage},
  abstract={To maximize its own profit, cloud service brokerage (CSB) aims to distribute tenant demands to reserved servers such that the total reservation cost is minimized with the tenants' service level agreement (SLA) being satisfied. The demand allocation problem for CSB is non-trivial to solve due to uncertainty of tenants' behavior. To avoid possible violations among demands, existing schemes allocate additional padding resources on the predicted demands, which leads to under-utilization of reserved resources. Accordingly, we propose a Probabilistic Demand Allocation (PDA) system to address the demand allocation problem for CSB. In PDA, we not only predict tenants' demands based on their historical records, but also estimate the probability distribution of prediction errors. As over- and under-estimation are equally likely to happen with our prediction method, when allocating demands to a single server, their errors are possibly offset. Hence, it is unnecessary to allocate additional resource to each demand for violation prevention. Given the predication results, we formulate the demand allocation problem by probabilistic optimization, of which the objective is to minimize the overall cost from reserved servers while satisfying tenants' SLA with high probability. Both simulation and real-world experimental results demonstrate the superiority of PDA in reducing servers' reservation cost.},

In this paper, we devise a distributed method for this problem, namely Distributed VOronoi based Cooperation scheme (DVOC), where nodes cooperate in hole detection and recovery. In previous Voronoi based schemes, each node only monitors its own critical points. Such methods are inefficient for k-coverage because the critical points are far away from their generating nodes in k-order Voronoi diagram, causing high cost for transmission and computing. As a solution, DVOC enables nodes to monitor others' critical points around themselves by building local Voronoi diagrams (LVDs). Further, DVOC constrains the movement of every node to avoid generating new holes. If a node cannot reach its destination due to the constraint, its hole healing responsibility will fall to other cooperating nodes. The experimental results from the real world testbed demonstrate that DVOC outperforms the previous schemes.},

  abstract = {For electric taxicabs, the idle time spent on cruising for passengers, seeking chargers, and charging is wasteful. Previous works can only save cruising time through better routing, or charger seeking and charging time through proper charger deployment, but not for both. With the advancement of wireless charging techniques, efficient opportunistic charging of electric vehicles at their parked positions becomes possible. This enables a taxicab to get charged while waiting for the next passenger. In this paper, we present an opportunistic wireless charger deployment scheme in a city, which both maximizes the taxicabs' opportunity of picking up passengers at the chargers and supports the taxicabs' continuous operability on roads, while minimizing the total deployment cost. We studied a metropolitan-scale taxicab dataset on several factors important for deploying wireless chargers and determining the numbers of the chargers in the regions: the number of passengers, the functionalities of buildings, and the frequency of passenger appearance in a region, and taxicab traffic flows in a city. Then, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem and find the solution. Our trace-driven experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our scheme over other representative methods in terms of reducing idle time and supporting the operability of the taxicabs.},
