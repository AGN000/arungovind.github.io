  abstract={The Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) has been linked to outdoor activity patterns and used to evaluate the effectiveness of urban interventions to improve thermal comfort. This study investigates how simulating the urban environment at increasing levels of physical accuracy impacts UTCI values along three cycling routes in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Baseline UTCI values are estimated using a local weather file, and the following increments in physical accuracy are considered: wind-scaling, shading from buildings, shading and cooling from trees, computational fluid dynamics simulations for wind speeds, and simulated surface temperatures. With bike ridership data from Bluebikes, Boston's bike-sharing program, the relationship between bike ridership patterns and UTCI values along each route is studied. Supervised machine learning models are applied to predict bike ridership based on UTCI and other predictors. UTCI simulation results show that incorporating the various increments of accuracy influences hourly UTCI values at urban areas and exposed areas differently. Incorporating local wind speeds is especially impactful for urban areas. The statistical models trained to predict hourly bike trip counts based on UTCI and other demand and weather predictors achieved a root-mean-squared error of 1.06 trips. 47\% of predictions were correct, and an additional 42\% of predictions were off by 1 trip. This study demonstrates the importance of spatial refinement in simulating UTCI, and motivates future research into efficient simulation methods or rules-of-thumb for deriving spatial-temporal UTCI values. Future work into building a robust predictive model would motivate the design of thermally comfortable environments for human-powered transportation in cities.},

  abstract={As work environments struggle to reopen during the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to establish practical decision-aiding tools. While a strong emphasis has been placed on determining generic guidelines to reduce the risk of airborne viral spread, there is a lack of free and easy-to-use simulation workflows to quantify indoor air quality and the risk of airborne pathogens indoors at a spatial resolution that can take into account floor-plan layouts, furniture, and ventilation inlet-outlet positions. This paper describes the development of a new, free, early design tool that allows designers and other stakeholders to simulate and compare viral airborne concentration under different indoor conditions. The tool leverages OpenFOAM-based Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and a passive scalar simulation approach to allow architects and interior designers to quantify airborne pathogens' exposure. The tool is integrated into the popular Rhino3d & Grasshopper CAD environment to facilitate its application in fast-paced design processes. We demonstrate good agreement compared to a CFD benchmark test. Further, we validate newly developed COVID-19 capabilities by comparing our results to an existing restaurant case study that included tracer gas measurements and validation using Fluent (Ansys). We demonstrate applications of the tool in a comparative study of a restaurant that investigates how plan and furniture layout interventions, ventilation strategies can impact the movement of airborne pathogens in indoor environments.},  pdf={https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351880927_Towards_Safer_Work_Environments_During_the_COVID-19_Crisis_A_Study_Of_Different_Floor_Plan_Layouts_and_Ventilation_Strategies_Coupling_Open_FOAM_and_Airborne_Pathogen_Data_2_for_Actionable_Simulation-},

  abstract = {Outdoor thermal comfort simulation simulations rely on the mean radiant temperature (MRT) seen by pedestrians as an important input that remains difficult to compute. Especially for large urban models, computing relevant surface temperatures and radiation fluxes that make up the MRT is a daunting task in terms of simulation setup and the computational overhead. We propose a new algorithm to estimate exterior surface temperatures of building facades, roofs, and ground surfaces in an arbitrary urban 3D model. The algorithm discretizes all model surfaces and clusters them by material properties and sky and sun exposure to reduce computational complexity. The model setup is fully automated, and the algorithm is implemented in the popular Rhino3d CAD environment. We demonstrate the accuracy of the algorithm by comparing both the resulting external surface temperatures against a high-fidelity simulation and the final MRT against real-world measurements. We report an RMSE of 1.8$\deg$C and 2.0$\deg$C, respectively, while reducing simulation times by a factor of 80. Envisioned applications of the algorithm range from rapid microclimate simulations in fast-paced urban design processes to large scale urban comfort evaluation of existing cities.},

Results computed with the cylindrical domain are validated against wind tunnel data. We report that the cylindrical method yields comparable results in terms of accuracy and convergence behaviour. Further, run time comparisons in a real-world scenario are conducted to discuss its advantages and limitations. Based on the findings, we recommend using the cylindrical approach if at least eight wind directions are analyzed for which we report 18% run time savings.

  abstract={Global warming and increasingly dense cities lead to poor outdoor thermal comfort that may not only be detrimental to our health and well-being but also decreases social and commercial activities. Although workflows for the analysis of thermal comfort exist, they have yet transitioned into the quotidian architectural design process. Our work-flow allows for annual outdoor comfort analyses that are seamlessly integrated into a commonly-used CAD environment. We simulated the annual outdoor thermal comfort on a university campus and discuss which simplifications seem appropriate by means of preliminary on-site measurements. The results exemplify the possibility to conduct such analyses within reasonable time and accuracy if some simplifications to the UTCI estimation are acceptable.},

  abstract={With the impending issues regarding global warming, urban design is considered a key driver to improve the microclimate in cities. For public spaces, studies suggest that outdoor thermal comfort may be seen as a proxy for space usage, and in turn, its attractiveness to people. Although the topic has gained interest in recent years, the discussion so far has focused on computing the metrics rather than deriving interventions from them. Here, we use the tool Eddy3D to model and analyze the outdoor thermal comfort of a designated area around a university campus. Further, we demonstrate how to estimate space usage from those results. Finally, we conduct a spatial sensitivity analysis of the underlying results as a step towards decision aiding. Our work demonstrates how decision-makers may derive areas where interventions will likely have the largest impact on outdoor thermal comfort performance.},

  abstract={Although recent advancements in computational architecture show promising capabilities, it remains difficult for architects to conduct advanced simulations due to the limited software interoperability.
  For thermal bridging analyses, the architectural community traditionally relies on specific software tools that are not integrated into a CAD environment. 
  To integrate such analyses into the ongoing design process, we implement a software tool to run heat transfer simulations with OpenFOAM from Grasshopper and Rhinoceros.
  This paper presents an implementation for box-shaped geometries and compares its results to a thermal bridge analysis from a validated simulation engine.
  We show that OpenFOAM's chtMultiregionFoam solver is capable of accurately predicting temperature distributions in a geometry setup with 13 different regions and 8 different materials.
  In conclusion, we show that heat transfer studies can be highly automated and integrated into an iterative design process.},

  abstract={With the rise of awareness of health and well-being in cities, urban environmental analysis should expand from energy performance to new environmental quality-based considerations. The limited potential to annually evaluate outdoor thermal comfort, predominant among these considerations, has restricted the exploration of the interrelations between urban morphology and annual energy performance. This study aims to bridge this gap by capitalizing on the new capabilities of Eddy3D â€“ a Grasshopper plugin which enables effective calculations of hourly microclimatic wind factors via OpenFOAM which in turn are used to generate annual outdoor thermal comfort plots. Using this method, a parametric study was conducted for different typology and density scenarios in three different hot climatic contexts in Israel. The automated analytical workflow evaluated a total of 60 design iterations for their energy balance, outdoor thermal comfort autonomy (OTCA) and self-shading levels using the shade index. The high correlation found here between the annual shade index and the OTCA, across all climatic contexts, shows the potential of the shade index to serve as an effective indicator, in these contexts, for comparative or optimization outdoor comfort studies. Further results are both the superiority of the courtyard typology in both energy and outdoor comfort studies, and the contrasting impact of higher density on the annual energy balance (lower performance) and outdoor thermal comfort (higher performance) in hot climates. The annual plots of both the energy balance and OTCA reveal various seasonal and monthly trends in the three different climatic zones which can lead to localized and seasonal urban design strategies.},

  author={Kastner, Patrick},
  year={2016},
  school={M.Sc. Thesis --- Technical University of Munich (TUM)},
  abstract={With increased awareness of sustainability, natural ventilation has become a strategy to reduce energy consumption in the built environment while providing comfortable indoor air quality. Themain aim of this thesis was to apply the CFD software OpenFOAM, to investigate the wind-induced natural ventilation potential of classrooms. Relevant ventilation metrics such as air change rates, age of air, and CO2 concentrationswere implemented. External and internal wind flows were simulated in one domain to assess the natural ventilation potential via RANS turbulence modeling. A case setup for a simple cross-ventilation geometry was validated against wind tunnel measurements in accordance with CFD guidelines for the built environment. Based on the validation, a case study was conducted for BRAC Universityâ€”located in subtropical Asia. The validation study revealed that OpenFOAM was able to accurately predict the flow field and flow rates for the cross-ventilation geometry. Further, OpenFOAMâ€™s passive scalar transport method is able to predict CO2 concentrations with a reasonable error range, while the work-flow can be highly automated. Applying these results to the case study, we suggest a number of geometry modifications to optimize the natural ventilation potential of classrooms for BRAC University. These include specific placement based on the wind direction, and either relocation or shape optimization of adjacent staircases. Additionally, we suggest the use of operable windows to accommodate temporal fluctuations throughout the year. Finally, passive scalar transport methods, which derive metrics like the age of air or CO2 concentrations, provide additional valuable information that should not be overlooked when evaluating design principles. In the future, it may be possible to employ tools based on the implemented ventilation metrics to automate the search for optimized building geometries for maximizing the natural ventilation potential.},
