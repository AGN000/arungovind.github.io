  abstract={We introduce an unsupervised machine learning method based on Siamese neural networks (SNNs) to detect phase boundaries. This method is applied to Monte-Carlo simulations of Ising-type systems and Rydberg atom arrays. In both cases the SNN reveals phase boundaries consistent with prior research. The combination of leveraging the power of feed-forward neural networks, unsupervised learning and the ability to learn about multiple phases without knowing about their existence provides a powerful method to explore new and unknown phases of matter.},

  preview={ExtremalLearning.gif},
  abstract={Neural networks allow us to model complex relationships between variables. We show how to efficiently find extrema of a trained neural network in regression problems. Finding the extremizing input of an approximated model is formulated as the training of an additional neural network with a loss function that minimizes when the extremizing input is achieved. We further show how to incorporate additional constraints on the input vector such as limiting the extrapolation of the extremizing input vector from the original training data set. An instructional example of this approach using TensorFlow is included.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
