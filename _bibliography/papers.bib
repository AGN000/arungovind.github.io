  abstract={Quantum Dot Cellular Automata (QCA) technology is one of the emerging next-generation nano-scale technologies, to subdue the limitations of existing CMOS technologies. As researchers continue to work hard to find an alternative to CMOS technology, QCA provides a solution for a faster computer with a smaller size and low power consumption. This paper implements an operation-rich “HACK ALU”, capable of performing many operations. Hack AL U is a versatile design that implements 64 op-erations with just 6 control bits along with novel implementations of adders and multiplexers. This ALU has been designed using a bottom-up approach by beginning the design by constructing the basic gates and progressing to the construction of adders, and multiplexers. The scope of the research is to provide an efficient ALU design that can be integrated in the CPU design. The present work has been implemented and tested on the QCA designer software. Experimental evaluation shows that logical and arithmetic operations are consistent in the proposed design.},
