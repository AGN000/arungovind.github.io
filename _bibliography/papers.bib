  abstract = {Objective
              The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of home birth in low-middle income countries (LMIC) according to geographic area and sociodemographic characteristics between 2000 and 2019.
              Methods
              A meta-analysis was carried out using the most recent demographic and health surveys as a data source (total countries: 67). A random-effects meta-analysis was obtained to calculate pooled prevalence estimates of home birth for all the countries included and by geographic region of the world. Likewise, a subgroup analysis was performed to estimate the prevalence of home birth according to the sociodemographic factors considered for this study.
              Results
              The global prevalence of home birth was 28% (95% CI: 0.24–0.33), with the lowest prevalence in the region of Europe & Central Asia (5%, 95% CI: 0.03–0.07) and the highest in East Asia & Pacific region (38%, 95% CI: 0.26–0.51). Twelve countries had proportions of home births greater than 50% (seven belonged to the Sub-Saharan Africa region). The countries with the highest proportion of home births were Chad (78%), Ethiopia (73%), and Niger and Yemen (70% each). Concerning the wealth index, in general, the richest quintile (quintile 5) presented the lowest proportion of home births. In contrast, the poorest (quintile 1) generally had the highest prevalence of home births. Regarding educational level, women without education presented the highest proportions of home births in general. In relation to the area of residence, in almost all the countries studied, women in rural areas generally had a higher proportion of home births than those in urban areas.
              Conclusions
              Home births occurred in approximately 3 out of 10 women in LMIC. There are also differences in the proportion of home births according to socioeconomic factors such as educational level, wealth index, and rurality.}

  abstract  = {Background: There is a global concern about the high rates of cesarean birth (CB). This study aimed to investigate the geographic and socioeconomic inequalities in CB rates in the Peruvian population. Methods: We conducted a population-based study using the Peruvian Demographic and Family Health Surveys (ENDES, the Spanish acronym for Encuesta Demográfica y de Salud Familiar) between 2009 and 2018. ENDES reported data from births registered in the five years preceding survey execution. For the years 2009 (n = 10 289) and 2018 (n = 23 077), we calculated the weighted rates of CB among variables such as natural geographic domain (Coast, Andean, or Amazon), area of residence (rural or urban), wealth index quintile (quintile 1 is poorest, and quintile 5 is richest), and educational level. To assess inequalities, we calculated the concentration index (CIs), the slope index of inequality (SII), and the relative index of inequality (RII). Results: The CB rates by year were 21.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 20.0-22.9) in 2009 and 34.5% (95% CI: 33.4-35.5) in 2018. Women living in urban and coastal regions and with a higher education level had the highest CB rates. All the CIs were positive, reflecting a prowealthy inequality in CB rates, and both SII and RII were positive, indicating a gap between the use of cesarean in women in the higher wealth quintile compared with those in the lower quintile. Conclusions: Cesarean birth rates have increased by 60% during the last decade in Peru. The richest wealth quintiles had the highest CB rates during the study years, which were well above global recommendations.},

  abstract  = {Background
               Higher rates of maternal complications and deaths have been described in home births. However, few local studies have evaluated factors associated with home births in Peru. The study aims to determine the prevalence and factors associated with home birth in the Peruvian population.
               Methods
               A population-based analytical cross-sectional study was conducted using pooled data from the 2015–2017 Peruvian Demographic and Health Surveys. A logistic regression model was performed to calculate crude and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for the association between sociodemographic and mother-related factors and home births.
               Results
               Seven out of every 100 births were home births. Living in a rural area (aOR = 3.10; 95% CI: 2.52–3.81), having a primary or secondary educational level, belonging to a medium or low wealth tertile, being from the rest of the Coast, Andean or Amazon regions, the second or greater number of birth order and considering the distance to the health center as problematic (aOR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.17–1.48) were found to be associated with a higher probability of home births. Contrarily, being in the age groups of 25–34 and 35–39 years old, having a multiple pregnancy and giving birth to a medium (aOR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.78–1.00) or large-sized newborn (aOR = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.72–0.93) were associated with a lower probability of presenting home births.
               Conclusions
               Sociodemographic factors are associated with home births in Peru. Further study of these factors is required to develop strategies specific to the needs of the population of childbearing age.}

  abstract  = {Background
               Cesarean section rates have been steadily increasing worldwide. Private health facilities are reported as being a major contributor to this rising rate in Latin America.
               Aim
               To assess the prevalence and determinants of cesarean section rates among public and private health facilities in Peru.
               Methods
               We performed a cross-sectional analytical study pooling the data of 52,215 women between 15 and 49 years of age from the 2015–2017 Peruvian Demographic and Family Health Survey (ENDES) database. Sociodemographic and pregnancy-related variables were used to construct adjusted logistic regression models for the indication of cesarean section.
               Findings
               The prevalence of cesarean births was 73.0% (95%CI: 71.1–74.9) and 30.3% (95% CI: 29.6–31.0) in private and public health facilities, respectively. In private facilities, living in an urban area, having a higher educational level, being in the age group of 35–49 years, and having multiple pregnancies increased the probability of a cesarean section. In public health facilities, living in an urban area, having a higher wealth quintile, higher education level, older maternal age, birth order, newborn size and gender, type of pregnancy, language, and maternal height were all factors associated with cesarean section.
               Conclusion
               The prevalence of cesarean section found in the present study was above the value recommended by the WHO (10%) for both public and private facilities. It is necessary to address the indiscriminate rise in the use of cesarean sections, developing strategies according to the type of health facility.}

               To determine socioeconomic inequalities in cardiovascular health (CVH) metrics among Peruvian adults as well as differences according to sex.
               Methods:
               An observational, cross-sectional study was conducted in 26,175 individuals aged 18–65 years using the 2017 Peruvian Demographic and Health Survey. According to the American Heart Association, 5 CVH metrics which comprised three ideal health behaviors (diet, non smoking, ideal body mass index [BMI]), and two ideal health factors (ideal blood pressure and no history of diabetes) were evaluated. The concentration curves (CC) methodology was used to analyze whether CVH metrics vary between socioeconomic status and sex. The concentration index (CI) was used to quantify socioeconomic-related inequality in health variables.
               Results:
               Overall, the mean age was 36.5 years (SD = 11.9) and 51.2% were women. Only 2.4% had 5 ideal CVH metrics (women 3.7%, men 1.0%) with a CI very close to the equality line (0.0135). (0.0135; higher in women [0.0262], compared to men [0,0002]). A greater prevalence of ideal CHV metrics (3 or more) was found in women (P < 0.001). Ideal health factors were more prevalent (52.1%) than ideal health behaviors (13.8%). Regarding inequality measures, CCs for most CVH metrics had a higher concentration in the lowest wealth population, except for ideal diet, which was more frequent among higher levels of wealth. An ideal BMI was the CVH metric with the lowest CI (overall: −0.0817; men: −0.2699).
               Conclusions:
               Peruvian women presented a higher prevalence of ideal CVH metrics and fewer inequalities. Ideal CVH metrics tend to be concentrated in the wealthiest women. Low- and middle-income countries should consider socioeconomic inequalities in cardiovascular disease prevention programs.}
