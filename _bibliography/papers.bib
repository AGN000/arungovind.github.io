  abstract  = {Data  Science  has  become  a  trending  research  topic  in  Computer  Science  due  to  the growing interest in extracting knowledge from different data sources.  In such a context, Jupyter Notebook has consolidated itself as one of the main tools used by data scientists to perform exploratory data analysis in a fast and straightforward way, with a high potential for code reproduction. Hence, this JAI aims to present Jupyter with reproducibility for developing Data Science projects.  The content is tailored for students and professionals with some programming experience.  In particular, we first introduce Jupyter andits general use to develop solutions for Data Science.  Then, we present Jupyter advanced topics and address ways to promote open science.  Finally, this JAI overviews Data Science with Jupyter Notebooks by combining concepts and theoretical foundations withpractical examples and real-world data.},

  abstract  = {The music industry has undergone many changes in the last few decades, notably since vinyl, cassettes and compact discs faded away as streaming platforms took the world by storm. This Digital evolution has made huge volumes of data about music consumption available. Based on such data, we perform cross-era comparisons between Physical and Digital media within the music market in Brazil. First, we build artists' success time series to detect and characterize hot streak periods, defined as high-impact bursts that occur in sequence, in both eras. Then, we identify groups of artists with distinct success levels by applying a cluster analysis based on hot streaks' features. We find the same clusters for both Physical and Digital eras: Spike Hit Artists, Big Hit Artists, and Top Hit Artists. Our results reveal significant changes in the music industry dynamics over the years by identifying the core of each era.},

 abstract={The start of the vaccination against COVID-19 was an essential step towards the end of the pandemic. In Brazil, CoronaVac was the first vaccine to be applied in the immunization campaign, and it is one of the most used today. Still, CoronaVac has specific components that have driven the spread of misinformation online. In this work, we compare the dissemination of misinformation on Twitter about the approval of such a vaccine for adults and children. The results show that misinformation is significant on Twitter and there has been a substantial change in the style of such content shared between 2021 and 2022, moving from a false narrative about the development of the vaccine to raising suspicions on the approval process by the health regulatory agency.},

 abstract={In Brazil, public bids must guarantee transparency and free competition between bidders. However, monitoring irregularities is complex because it involves a huge volume of data and a small number of specialists. In this context, this work proposes the use of a methodology based on the concepts of audit trails and social networks to raise fraud alerts, to assist in the fight against corruption. The characterization and analysis of a real social network, associated with a case study of a possible fraudulent bid, reveal that the methodology presented is able to identify suspicious bids, identified by a set of audit trails.},

We collect a part of such data and perform cross-era comparative analyses between physical and digital media for successful artists within the music market in Brazil. Given an artist’s career, we focus on hot streak periods defined as high-impact bursts occurring in sequence. Specifically, we construct artists’ success time series to detect and characterize hot streak periods for both physical and digital eras. Then, we assess their features, analyze them in the genre scale, and perform a cluster analysis to identify groups of artists with distinct success levels. For both physical and digital eras, we find the same clusters: Spike Hit Artists, Big Hit Artists, and Top Hit Artists.

In this paper, we present MUHSIC, a novel dataset with enhanced information on musical success. We focus on artists and genres by combining chart-related data with acoustic metadata to describe the temporal evolution of musical careers. The enriched and curated data allow building success-based time series to investigate high-impact periods (hot streaks) in such careers, transforming complex data into knowledge. Overall, MUHSIC is a relevant tool in music-related tasks due to its easy use and replicability.},

Specially, we believe that country's background and contextual features are directly related to what people read. Hence, we perform a cross-state comparison analysis based on Brazilian reading preferences through a multipartite network model. Also, we explore the effects of socioeconomic and demographic factors on favorite books and writing genres. Such cross-state analyses highlight how the country is culturally rich, where each region has its own distinctive culture. Our findings offer great opportunities for the Brazilian book industry by enhancing current knowledge on social indicators related to reading preferences.},

As genre is one of the most prominent highlevel music descriptors, all music-related analyses may depend on it. In this study, we propose to analyze the relation between musicians teaming up on a hit song with its success under a genre perspective. Our methodology includes building success-based genre collaboration networks to detect collaboration profiles and studying their evolution over time. With this work, we aim to provide potential impact to both the research community and the music industry},
