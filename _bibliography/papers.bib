  title={RECON: Relation Extraction using Knowledge Graph Context in a Graph Neural Network},
  author={Anson Bastos, Abhishek Nadgeri, Kuldeep Singh, Isaiah Onando Mulang, Saeedeh Shekarpour, Johannes Hoffart, and Manohar Kaul},
  abstract={In this paper, we present a novel method named RECON, that automatically identifies relations in a sentence (sentential relation extraction) and aligns to a knowledge graph (KG). RECON uses a graph neural network to learn representations of both the sentence as well as facts stored in a KG, improving the overall extraction quality. These facts, including entity attributes (label, alias, description, instance-of) and factual triples, have not been collectively used in the state of the art methods. We evaluate the effect of various forms of representing the KG context on the performance of RECON. The empirical evaluation on two standard relation extraction datasets shows that RECON significantly outperforms all state of the art methods on NYT Freebase and Wikidata datasets.},

  title={A Weighted Quiver Kernel using Functor Homology},
  author={Manohar Kaul and Dai Tamaki},
  abstract={In this paper, we propose a new homological method to study weighted directed networks. Our model of such networks is a directed graph \(Q\) equipped with a weight function ww on the set \(Q_{1}\) of arrows in \(Q\). We require that the range \(W\) of our weight function is equipped with an addition or a multiplication, i.e., \(W\) is a monoid in the mathematical terminology. When \(W\) is equipped with a representation on a vector space \(M\), the standard method of homological algebra allows us to define the homology groups \(H_{*}(Q,w;M)\). It is known that when \(Q\) has no oriented cycles, \(H_{n}(Q,w;M)=0\) for \(nâ‰¥2\) and \(H_{1}(Q,w;M)\) can be easily computed. This fact allows us to define a new graph kernel for weighted directed graphs. We made two sample computations with real data and found that our method is practically applicable.},

  title={Self-Supervised Few-Shot Learning on Point Clouds},
  author={Charu Sharma and Manohar Kaul},
  abstract={The increased availability of massive point clouds coupled with their utility in a wide variety of applications such as robotics, shape synthesis, and self-driving cars has attracted increased attention from both industry and academia. Recently, deep neural networks operating on labeled point clouds have shown promising results on supervised learning tasks like classification and segmentation. However, supervised learning leads to the cumbersome task of annotating the point clouds. To combat this problem, we propose two novel self-supervised pre-training tasks that encode a hierarchical partitioning of the point clouds using a cover-tree, where point cloud subsets lie within balls of varying radii at each level of the cover-tree. Furthermore, our self-supervised learning network is restricted to pre-train on the support set (comprising of scarce training examples) used to train the downstream network in a few-shot learning (FSL) setting. Finally, the fully-trained self-supervised network's point embeddings are used to initialize the downstream task's network. We present a comprehensive empirical evaluation of our method on both downstream classification and segmentation tasks and show that supervised methods pre-trained with our self-supervised learning method significantly improve the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our method also outperforms previous unsupervised methods in downstream classification tasks.},

@article{sharma2020simplicial,
  title={Simplicial Complex based Point Correspondence between Images warped onto Manifolds},
  author={Charu Sharma and Manohar Kaul},
  abstract={Recent increase in the availability of warped images projected onto a manifold (e.g., omnidirectional spherical images), coupled with the success of higher-order assignment methods, has sparked an interest in the search for improved higher-order matching algorithms on warped images due to projection. Although currently, several existing methods 'flatten' such 3D images to use planar graph / hypergraph matching methods, they still suffer from severe distortions and other undesired artifacts, which result in inaccurate matching. Alternatively, current planar methods cannot be trivially extended to effectively match points on images warped onto manifolds. Hence, matching on these warped images persists as a formidable challenge. In this paper, we pose the assignment problem as finding a bijective map between two graph induced simplicial complexes, which are higher-order analogues of graphs. We propose a constrained quadratic assignment problem (QAP) that matches each p-skeleton of the simplicial complexes, iterating from the highest to the lowest dimension. The accuracy and robustness of our approach are illustrated on both synthetic and real-world spherical / warped (projected) images with known ground-truth correspondences. We significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art spherical matching methods on a diverse set of datasets.},
