abstract = {In a supervised setting, the global classification paradigm leverages the whole training data to produce a single class discriminative model. Alternatively, the local classification approach builds multiple base classifiers, each of them using a small subset of the training data. In this paper, we take a path to stand in-between the global and local approaches. We introduce a two-level clustering-based method in which base classifiers operate on a larger portion of the input space than in the traditional local paradigm. In particular, we first obtain a grained input representation by employing a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to the inputs. We then apply a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means) to the SOM units to define input regions — a subset of input samples associated with a specific cluster of SOM units. We refer to this approach as regional classification. We demonstrate the effectiveness of regional classification on several benchmarks. Also, we study the impact of (1) adopting linear and nonlinear base classifiers (e.g., least squares support vector machines) and (2) using cluster validation indexes to determine the optimal number of clusters. Based on the experiments, the regional classification approach achieves competitive performance compared to its global and local counterparts, especially when equipped with linear base classifiers.}

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
