	abbr = {Calc Var PDE},
	abstract = {In this paper we introduce Peierls--Nabarro type models for edge dislocations at {\it semi-coherent} interfaces between two heterogeneous crystals, and prove the optimality of uniformly distributed {\it edge dislocations}. Specifically, we show that the elastic energy $\Gamma$-converges to a limit functional comprised of two contributions: one is given by a constant $c<sub>\infty</sub> > 0$ gauging the minimal energy induced by dislocations at the interface, and corresponding to a uniform distribution of edge dislocations; the other one accounts for the far field elastic energy induced by the presence of further, possibly not uniformly distributed, dislocations. After assuming periodic boundary conditions and formally considering the limit from semi-coherent to coherent interfaces, we show that $c<sub>\infty</sub>$ is reached when dislocations are evenly-spaced on the one dimensional circle.},

@phdthesis{fan-phd-2018,
	abbr = {PhD Thesis},
	abstract = {The main focus of this PhD thesis is the study of microstructures and geometric patterns in materials, in the framework of the Calculus of Variations. My PhD research, carried out in collaboration with my supervisor Mariapia Palombaro and Marcello Ponsiglione, led to the production of three papers $[21, 22, 23]$. Papers $[21, 22]$ have already been published, while $[23]$ is currently in preparation. 

This thesis is divided into two main parts. In the first part we present the results obtained in $[22, 23]$. In these two works geometric patterns have to be understood as patterns of dislocations in crystals. The second part is devoted to $[21]$, where suitable microgeometries are needed as a mean to produce gradients that display critical integrability properties.},

	abstract = {We study the higher gradient integrability of distributional solutions $u$ to the equation ${div}(\sigma \nabla u)=0$ in dimension two, in the case when the essential range of $\sigma$ consists of
only two elliptic matrices, i.e., $\sigma \in \{ \sigma<sub>1</sub>,  \sigma<sub>2</sub>  \}$ a.e. in $\Omega$. In Nesi et al. (Ann Inst H Poincar{\'e} Anal Non Lin{\'e}aire 31(3):615--638, 2014),  for every pair of elliptic matrices $\sigma<sub>1</sub>$ and $\sigma<sub>2</sub>$, exponents $p<sub>{\sigma<sub>1</sub>,\sigma<sub>2</sub>}</sub> \in (0,+\infty)$ and $q<sub>{\sigma<sub>1</sub>,\sigma<sub>2</sub>}</sub> \in (1,2)$ have been found so that if $u \in W<sup>{1, q<sub>{\sigma<sub>1</sub>,\sigma<sub>2</sub>}</sub> }</sup> (\Omega)$ is a solution to the elliptic equation then $\nabla u \in L<sup>{1, p<sub>{\sigma<sub>1</sub>,\sigma<sub>2</sub>}</sub>}</sup> (\Omega,weak)$ and the optimality of the upper exponent $p<sub>{\sigma<sub>1</sub>,\sigma<sub>2</sub>}</sub>$ has been proved. In this paper we complement the above result by proving the optimality of the lower exponent $q<sub>{\sigma<sub>1</sub>,\sigma<sub>2</sub>}</sub>$. Precisely, we show that for every arbitrarily small $\delta$, one can find a particular microgeometry, i.e., an arrangement of the sets $\sigma<sup>{-1}</sup>(\sigma<sub>1</sub>)$ and $\sigma<sup>{-1}</sup>(\sigma<sub>2</sub>)$, for which there exists a solution $u$ to the corresponding elliptic equation such that $\nabla u \in L<sup>{ q<sub>{  \sigma<sub>1</sub>, \sigma<sub>2</sub>  }</sub>  - \delta}</sup>$ but $\nabla u \notin L<sup>{q<sub>{  \sigma<sub>1</sub>, \sigma<sub>2</sub>  }</sub>}</sup>$. The existence of such optimal microgeometries is achieved by convex integration methods, adapting to the present setting the geometric constructions provided in Astala et al. (Ann Scuola Norm Sup Pisa Cl Sci 5(7):1--50, 2008) for the isotropic case.},

	abbr = {J Nonlinear Sci},
	abstract = {We propose and analyze a simple variational model for dislocations at semi-coherent interfaces. The energy functional describes the competition between two terms: a surface energy induced by dislocations and a bulk elastic energy, spent to decrease the amount of dislocations needed to compensate the lattice misfit. We prove that, for minimizers, the former scales like the surface area of the interface, the latter like its diameter. The proposed continuum model is built on some explicit computations done in the framework of the semi-discrete theory of dislocations. Even if we deal with finite elasticity, linearized elasticity naturally emerges in our analysis since the far-field strain vanishes as the interface size increases.},

@article{bre-fan-2020,
	abbr = {ESAIM: M2AN},
	abstract = {In this paper we propose and study a novel optimal transport based regularization of linear dynamic inverse problems. The considered inverse problems aim at recovering a measure valued curve and are dynamic in the sense that (i) the measured data takes values in a time dependent family of Hilbert spaces, and (ii) the forward operators are time dependent and map, for each time, Radon measures into the corresponding data space. The variational regularization we propose is based on dynamic (un-)balanced optimal transport which means that the measure valued curves to recover (i) satisfy the continuity equation, i.e., the Radon measure at time t is advected by a velocity field v and varies with a growth rate g, and (ii) are penalized with the kinetic energy induced by v and a growth energy induced by g. We establish a functional-analytic framework for these regularized inverse problems, prove that minimizers exist and are unique in some cases, and study regularization properties. This framework is applied to dynamic image reconstruction in undersampled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), modelling relevant examples of time varying acquisition strategies, as well as patient motion and presence of contrast agents.},
