  abstract={Quantum Dot Cellular Automata (QCA) technology is one of the emerging next-generation nano-scale technologies, to subdue the limitations of existing CMOS technologies. As researchers continue to work hard to find an alternative to CMOS technology, QCA provides a solution for a faster computer with a smaller size and low power consumption. This paper implements an operation-rich “HACK ALU”, capable of performing many operations. Hack AL U is a versatile design that implements 64 op-erations with just 6 control bits along with novel implementations of adders and multiplexers. This ALU has been designed using a bottom-up approach by beginning the design by constructing the basic gates and progressing to the construction of adders, and multiplexers. The scope of the research is to provide an efficient ALU design that can be integrated in the CPU design. The present work has been implemented and tested on the QCA designer software. Experimental evaluation shows that logical and arithmetic operations are consistent in the proposed design.},

  abstract={ Power quality monitoring and parameter estima-
tion are essential for the proper functioning of modern power
grids. Various techniques have been proposed to estimate the
characteristics of power signals and to gain insight into their
dynamics. Non-stationary Fourier mode decomposition (NFMD)
is a new interpretable time-frequency analysis framework for
non-stationary and nonlinear signals. This work investigates
the prospects of NFMD in the estimation of power-system
characteristics such as fundamental frequency, amplitude and
presence of disturbance components. Usage of NFMD as a noise
removal technique is also explored in the current work. Results
show that NFMD is robust to noisy disturbances and can perform
well in noisy environments. The proposed methodology can be
used for real-time analysis and interpretation of large volume of
data from advanced smart metering techniques such as micro-
phasor measurement units in microgrids},

  title={ Exploiting Graph Matrix Duality for Efficient Graph Data Processing},
 author={ Aadhithya, A Aadharsh. and  Rejathalal, Vinith. and  Soman K.P. and Prabhaharan Poornachandran},
  abstract={ 
   Linear algebra is the backbone of modern applied data analytics. Not only does it provide the theoretical substratum for the development of analytical algorithms it also lends the technological support for extremely efficient implementations. The linear algebra ecosystem consists of remarkably fast hardware support with equally efficient software solutions leveraging the hardware capacity. Graphs are an ubiquitous modelling framework for the representation and analysis of connected data.A flipside from practical perspective is that conventional graph algorithms are challenging as they are hard to parallelize and often make too much use of non-linear data structures which do not have hardware support. In this context, this paper presents an invitation to an alternate way to look at graph processing in terms of algebraic constructs, formulations and technology. The paper presents the theoretical underpinnings of the new view and also some interesting progresses at the frontier level in this direction. Above all, an intended objective is to present a compelling invite to the academia and research community to adopt this approach in their academic and research activities.

 author={B.E.Pranav Kumaar, Aadharsh Aadhithya A, Sachin Kumar S, Prabaharan Poornachandran, Sujadevi VG, Soman K.P},
  abstract={ 
  The concept of Perfect Phylogeny is observed to be non-universal but in some very specific studies they have shown provide
great insights from a biological standpoint. Most natural phlogenies are imperfect but this is debated by data noise acting as a
disguise, the solution to uncover the underlying perfect phylogeny in the logically simplest approach is the Minimum Character
Removal(MCR) problem. Anther variant of the solution achieved by change in perspective and computational methodologies is
the Maximal Character Compatibility(MCC) problem. Both the MCR and MCC problems are solved optimally with reasonable
efficiency by employing the Integer Linear Programming(ILP) technique. A central part of MCC solution involves solving the
Max-clique problem of the generated representation allowing numerous clique solving algorithms to generate various solutions.
The comparison between solutions optimality and run-time of these methods substantiate the goal of the different algorithms being
applied. The above methods are formulated, and implemented using modern programming languages like python and matlab. This
exploration introduces the problem of perfect phylogeny, its ILP formulations and its solution along with comparisons between
different methods in consideration

  abstract={ 
  The maximal clique problem has been a cornerstone for developments in combinatorial
optimization. The problem also shows up in innumerable practically relevant scenarios. With rapid
advancements in Integer Linear Programming(ILP) solvers, it becomes necessary to have timely benchmark
studies against state of the art methods to check if ILP solvers are ready for practical use cases. This work
presents a benchmark study between ILP, BK algorithm and few other approximate methods with standard
DIMACS instances. This work also aims in providing a friendly introduction to clique based graph problems
and one of its application in biological contexts, prediction of missing edges in a protein-protein interaction
network. This paper also outlines in supplementary section, simple methods to solve clique problems using
excel,python and matlab.
