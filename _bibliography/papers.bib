  title={Power Decarbonization in a Global Energy Market: The Climate Effect of U.S. LNG Exports},
  abstract={Investment in clean power depends on the price of internationally traded fossil fuels. To what extent can major fossil fuel exporters like the U.S. influence global electricity decarbonization through their trade policy? To answer this question, I build and estimate a multi-country dynamic model of investment in power assets.  In the model, the carbon intensity of electricity production is determined by the entry and exit of power plants using alternative fuels (coal, natural gas, or renewables), and the local price of fossil fuel inputs is determined in a global trade equilibrium. I use the model to analyze the climate effects of building all U.S. liquified natural gas (LNG) export terminals currently seeking federal approval, which would double U.S. export capacity by 2030.  Preliminary results show an absolute decrease in comulative emissions up to 2060 in response to the shock, driven by an increase in the local price of natural gas in the U.S. that incentivizes lower gas generation capacity build-out and higher long-term adoption of renewable energy sources. In the rest of the world, the shock exhibits varying effects across space and time: initial short-term emission reductions in coal-intensive power markets are later offset by a widespread reduction in renewable adoption. By 2055, annual emission reductions in the U.S. are almost completely offset by the increase in emissions in the rest of the world.},
