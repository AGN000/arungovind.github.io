These approaches do not work for closely related species where gross features are indistinguishable and related genomes are lacking. We describe a method and associated software package that uses rapidly evolving repetitive DNA to circumvent these limitations. By using short, repetitive, DNA sequences as species-specific signals we separated closely related genomes without any prior knowledge. This approach is ideal for separating the subgenomes of polyploid species with unsequenced or unknown progenitor genomes.},

However, a generalized and user-friendly approach for execution, training, and interpreting deep learning models for methylation data is lacking. Results: We introduce and demonstrate the robust performance of MethylNet on downstream tasks of DNA methylation analysis, including cell-type deconvolution, pan-cancer classification, and subject age prediction. We interrogate the learned features from a pan-cancer classification to show high fidelity clustering of cancer subtypes, and compare the importance assigned to CpGs for the age and cell-type analyses to demonstrate concordance with expected biology.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Machine learning approaches have become increasingly popular modeling techniques, relying on data-driven heuristics to arrive at its solutions. Recent comparisons between these algorithms and traditional statistical modeling techniques have largely ignored the superiority gained by the former approaches due to involvement of model-building search algorithms. This has led to alignment of statistical and machine learning approaches with different types of problems and the under-development of procedures that combine their attributes. In this context, we hoped to understand the domains of applicability for each approach and to identify areas where a marriage between the two approaches is warranted. We then sought to develop a hybrid statistical - machine learning procedure with the best attributes of each. Methods: We first present three simple examples to illustrate when to use each modeling approach and posit a general framework for combining them into an enhanced logistic regression model building procedure that aids interpretation. We next study 556 benchmark machine learning datasets to uncover when machine learning techniques outperformed rudimentary logistic regression models and so are potentially well-equipped to enhance them. We develop and illustrate a software package, InteractionTransformer, which embeds logistic regression with advanced model building capacity by using a machine learning algorithm to extract candidate interaction features from a random forest model for inclusion in the model. Finally, we apply our enhanced logistic regression analysis to two real-word biomedical examples, one where predictors vary linearly with the outcome and another with extensive second-order interactions. Results: Preliminary statistical analysis demonstrated that across the 556 benchmark datasets, the random forest approach significantly outperformed the logistic regression approach. We found a statistically significant increase in predictive performance when using the hybrid procedure and greater clarity in the association with the outcome of terms acquired compared to directly interpreting the random forest output. Conclusions: When a random forest model is closer to the true model, hybrid statistical - machine learning procedures can substantially enhance the performance of statistical procedures in an automated manner while preserving easy interpretation of the results. Such hybrid methods may help facilitate the widespread adoption of machine learning techniques in the biomedical setting.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Recent efforts have sought to accurately quantitate the distribution of tissue features and morphology in digitized images of histological tissue sections, Whole Slide Images (WSI). Generative modeling techniques present a unique opportunity to produce training data that can both augment these models and translate histologic data across different intra-and-inter-institutional processing procedures, provide cost-effective ways to perform computational chemical stains (synthetic stains) on tissue, and facilitate the creation of diagnostic aid algorithms. A critical evaluation and understanding of these technologies is vital for their incorporation into a clinical workflow. We illustrate several potential use cases of these techniques for the calculation of nuclear to cytoplasm ratio, synthetic SOX10 immunohistochemistry (IHC, sIHC) staining to delineate cell lineage, and the conversion of hematoxylin and eosin (H\&amp;E) stain to trichome stain for the staging of liver fibrosis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Image registration involves finding the best alignment between different images of the same object. In these tasks, the object in question is viewed differently in each of the images (e.g. different rotation or light conditions, etc.). In digital pathology, image registration aligns correspondent regions of tissue from different stereotactic viewpoints (e.g. subsequent deeper sections of the same tissue). These comparisons are important for histological analysis and can facilitate previously unavailable manipulations, such as 3D tissue reconstruction and cell-level alignment of immunohistochemical (IHC) and special stains. Several benchmarks have been established for evaluating image registration techniques for histological tissue; however, little work has evaluated the impact of scaling registration techniques to Giga-Pixel Whole Slide Images (WSI), which are large enough for significant memory limitations, and contain recurrent patterns and deformations that hinder traditional alignment algorithms. Furthermore, as tissue sections often contain multiple, discrete, smaller tissue fragments, it is unnecessary to align an entire image when the bulk of the image is background whitespace and tissue fragments’ orientations are often agnostic of each other. We present a methodology for circumventing large-scale image registration issues in histopathology and accompanying software. By removing background pixels, parsing the slide into discrete tissue segments, and matching, orienting and registering smaller segment pairs, we recovered registrations with lower Target Registration Error (TRE) when compared to utilizing the unmanipulated WSI. We tested our technique by having a pathologist annotate landmarks from 13 pairs of differently stained liver biopsy slides, performing WSI and segment-based registration techniques, and comparing overall TRE. Preliminary results demonstrate superior performance of registering segment pairs versus registering WSI (difference of median TRE of 44 pixels, p\&lt;0.001). Segment matching within WSI is an effective solution for histology image registration but requires further testing and validation to ensure its viability for stain translation and 3D histology analysis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a type of fatty liver disease characterized by accumulation of fat in hepatocytes and concurrent inflammation. It is associated with significant morbidity as it can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure and increases the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. NASH has become increasingly prevalent in the US and is a leading cause of liver transplantation for end stage liver disease and a significant public health burden. Grading and staging NASH involves liver core biopsy, followed by microscopic examination of histologic preparations of the tissue. Tissue sections are stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H\&amp;E) to grade NASH activity, and stained with trichrome to help stage fibrosis. Methods to computationally transform one stain into another on digital whole slide images (WSI) can reduce the need for additional physical staining besides H\&amp;E, alleviating personnel, equipment, and time costs. Recent computational techniques have shown promise and success for virtual staining of tissue. We conducted a large-scale validation study of the viability of virtual staining technologies for H\&amp;E to trichrome conversion on WSI (n=574). Our results demonstrate that virtual trichrome technologies present an immediate software solution that can be readily employed in the clinical setting as a diagnostic decision aid.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Deep learning approaches to digital pathology typically extract information from sub-images (patches) and treat the sub-images as independent entities, ignoring contributing information from vital large-scale architectural relationships. Modeling approaches that can capture higher-order dependencies between neighborhoods of tissue patches have demonstrated the potential to improve predictive accuracy while capturing the most essential slide-level information for prognosis, diagnosis and integration with other omics modalities. Here, we review two promising methods for capturing macro and micro architecture of histology images, Graph Neural Networks, which contextualize patch level information from their neighbors through message passing, and Topological Data Analysis, which distills contextual information into its essential components. We introduce a modeling framework, \textit{WSI-GTFE} that integrates these two approaches in order to identify and quantify key pathogenic information pathways. To demonstrate a simple use case, we utilize these topological methods to develop a tumor invasion score to stage colon cancer.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Comparative analysis suggests that most B. hybridum whole gene presence/absence variation is part of the standing variation in its diploid progenitors. Analysis of nuclear single nucleotide variants, plastomes and k-mers associated with retrotransposons reveals two independent origins for B. hybridum, {\textasciitilde}1.4 and {\textasciitilde}0.14 million years ago. Examination of gene expression in the younger B. hybridum lineage reveals no bias in overall subgenome expression. Our results are consistent with a gradual accumulation of genomic changes after polyploidization and a lack of subgenome expression dominance.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: DNA methylation (DNAm) is an epigenetic regulator of gene expression programs that can be altered by environmental exposures, aging, and in pathogenesis. Traditional analyses that associate DNAm alterations with phenotypes suffer from multiple hypothesis testing and multi-collinearity due to the high-dimensional, continuous, interacting and non-linear nature of the data. Deep learning analyses have shown much promise to study disease heterogeneity. DNAm deep learning approaches have not yet been formalized into user-friendly frameworks for execution, training, and interpreting models. Here, we describe MethylNet, a DNAm deep learning method that can construct embeddings, make predictions, generate new data, and uncover unknown heterogeneity with minimal user supervision.
RESULTS: The results of our experiments indicate that MethylNet can study cellular differences, grasp higher order information of cancer sub-types, estimate age and capture factors associated with smoking in concordance with known differences.
CONCLUSION: The ability of MethylNet to capture nonlinear interactions presents an opportunity for further study of unknown disease, cellular heterogeneity and aging processes.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12874-020-01046-3},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Machine learning approaches have become increasingly popular modeling techniques, relying on data-driven heuristics to arrive at its solutions. Recent comparisons between these algorithms and traditional statistical modeling techniques have largely ignored the superiority gained by the former approaches due to involvement of model-building search algorithms. This has led to alignment of statistical and machine learning approaches with different types of problems and the under-development of procedures that combine their attributes. In this context, we hoped to understand the domains of applicability for each approach and to identify areas where a marriage between the two approaches is warranted. We then sought to develop a hybrid statistical-machine learning procedure with the best attributes of each.
METHODS: We present three simple examples to illustrate when to use each modeling approach and posit a general framework for combining them into an enhanced logistic regression model building procedure that aids interpretation. We study 556 benchmark machine learning datasets to uncover when machine learning techniques outperformed rudimentary logistic regression models and so are potentially well-equipped to enhance them. We illustrate a software package, InteractionTransformer, which embeds logistic regression with advanced model building capacity by using machine learning algorithms to extract candidate interaction features from a random forest model for inclusion in the model. Finally, we apply our enhanced logistic regression analysis to two real-word biomedical examples, one where predictors vary linearly with the outcome and another with extensive second-order interactions.
RESULTS: Preliminary statistical analysis demonstrated that across 556 benchmark datasets, the random forest approach significantly outperformed the logistic regression approach. We found a statistically significant increase in predictive performance when using hybrid procedures and greater clarity in the association with the outcome of terms acquired compared to directly interpreting the random forest output.
CONCLUSIONS: When a random forest model is closer to the true model, hybrid statistical-machine learning procedures can substantially enhance the performance of statistical procedures in an automated manner while preserving easy interpretation of the results. Such hybrid methods may help facilitate widespread adoption of machine learning techniques in the biomedical setting.},

The present studies attempted to integrate these lines of research by testing the degree to which contamination-based OCD is associated with individual differences in disgust propensity and sensitivity, affective distress in response to perceived contaminants, and perceived threat of illness. In Study 1, a convenience sample of 185 adults completed self-report scales assessing obsessive-compulsive symptoms, disgust propensity and sensitivity, germ aversion, and perceived infectability. Multivariate regression showed that disgust propensity and germ aversion were the only significant predictors of contamination-based obsessions and compulsions. Exploratory analyses suggested that there was a significant indirect effect of disgust propensity on contamination-based obsessions and compulsions via germ aversion. Findings from Study 1 were replicated using a sample of twenty-six obsessive-compulsive participants. Despite the substantially smaller sample, the proportion of the total effects attributable to the mediating effect of germ aversion was comparable, consistent with a significant partial mediation in both samples. These results together suggest that contamination-based OCD symptoms are likely maintained and motivated by basic affective processes.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in malignancy rates and molecular alterations based on the presence of different criteria. Methods A laboratory information search was conducted to identify thyroid fine-needle aspiration specimens signed out as AUS. The cases were reclassified as architectural atypia (3A), cytologic atypia (3C), both architectural and cytologic atypia (3B), or Hürthle cell aspirate (3H). Surgical follow-up and concurrent molecular test results, if available, were collected. Results Five hundred ten specimens, including 258 reclassified as 3A, 40 reclassified as 3B, 119 reclassified as 3C, and 86 reclassified as 3H, were identified. The risks of malignancy for the subcategories were 13.4\%, 26.3\%, 44.1\%, and 13.8\%, respectively. Additionally, BRAF V600E mutations were more prevalent in specimens with cytologic atypia (3B/3C), whereas low-risk alterations, including KRAS, PTEN, and PAX8-PPARy2, were more prevalent in those with architectural atypia (3A). Conclusions Subdividing AUS specimens on the basis of the type of atypia can yield categories associated with distinct molecular alterations and risks of malignancy.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Optimum timing of postoperative showering varies. Earlier showering improves patient satisfaction, but the impact of the timing of showering on postoperative infection is unclear. We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to investigate the outcomes of various postoperative showering practices.
METHODS: We searched PubMed to identify relevant human clinical studies in English, and searched these for additional references. Articles were reviewed for patient demographics, surgical specialty and procedure, wound closure method, placement of drains, showering protocol, and rates of infection and complications. Only randomized controlled trials were analyzed. A random-effects meta-analysis model was used to determine overall infection and complication rates between patients allowed to shower within the first 48 h postoperatively or later.
RESULTS: Out of 357 studies, seven and five were included in the infection and complications rate meta-analyses, respectively. A total of 1,881 and 958 patients were included in each analysis; 605 and 477 patients in each analysis were allowed to shower on or before postoperative day 2 ("early"), while the remainder were prohibited from showering until postoperative day 3 to beyond one week ("delayed") postoperatively. There was no difference in infection (p = 0.45, [-0.0052, 2 × 0.007 95\% CI]) or complication rate (p = 0.36, [-0.0046, 2 × 0.005 95\% CI]) with earlier vs. delayed showering protocols.
CONCLUSION: Published literature demonstrates no increase in the overall rate of wound infections or complications when patients showered earlier in the postoperative period. Additional randomized studies are needed to determine the ideal time for postoperative showering. These data should be considered by surgeons while determining when to permit patients to shower after surgery.},

	abstract = {The public health burden of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a liver condition characterized by excessive lipid accumulation and subsequent tissue inflammation and fibrosis, has burgeoned with the spread of western lifestyle habits. Progression of fibrosis into cirrhosis is assessed using histological staging scales (e.g., NASH Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN)). These scales are used to monitor disease progression as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of therapies. However, clinical drug trials for NASH are typically underpowered due to lower than expected inter-/intra-rater reliability, which impacts measurements at screening, baseline, and endpoint. Bridge ratings represent a phenomenon where pathologists assign two adjacent stages simultaneously during assessment and may further complicate these analyses when ad hoc procedures are applied. Statistical techniques, dubbed Bridge Category Models, have been developed to account for bridge ratings, but not for the scenario where multiple pathologists assess biopsies across time points. Here, we develop hierarchical Bayesian extensions for these statistical methods to account for repeat observations and use these methods to assess the impact of bridge ratings on the inter-/intra-rater reliability of the NASH CRN staging scale. We also report on how pathologists may differ in their assignment of bridge ratings to highlight different staging practices. Our findings suggest that Bridge Category Models can capture additional fibrosis staging heterogeneity with greater precision, which translates to potentially higher reliability estimates in contrast to the information lost through ad hoc approaches.},

However, assessment of learned image feature relationships with variation in crude mortality rate across the United States has been lacking.Objective: We sought to investigate if county-level mortality rates in the U.S. could be predicted from satellite images.Methods: Satellite images of neighborhoods surrounding schools were extracted with the Google Static Maps application programming interface for 430 counties representing {\textasciitilde}68.9\% of the US population. A convolutional neural network was trained using crude mortality rates for each county in 2015 to predict mortality. Learned image features were interpreted using Shapley Additive Feature Explanations, clustered, and compared to mortality and its associated covariate predictors.Results: Predicted mortality from satellite images in a held-out test set of counties was strongly correlated to the true crude mortality rate (Pearson r = 0.72). Direct prediction of mortality using a deep learning model across a cross-section of 430 U.S. counties identified key features in the environment (e.g., sidewalks, driveways, and hiking trails) associated with lower mortality. Learned image features were clustered, and we identified 10 clusters that were associated with education, income, geographical region, race, and age.Conclusions: The application of deep learning techniques to remotely-sensed features of the built environment can serve as a useful predictor of mortality in the United States. Although we identified features that were largely associated with demographic information, future modeling approaches that directly identify image features associated with health-related outcomes have the potential to inform targeted public health interventions.},

For instance, TriNetX, Inc., a global health research network, has access to more than 300 million patients, sourced from healthcare organizations, biopharmaceutical companies, and contract research organizations. As such, pipelines that are able to algorithmically extract huge quantities of patient data from multiple modalities present opportunities to leverage machine learning and deep learning approaches with the possibility of generating actionable insight. In this work, we present a modular, semi-automated end-to-end machine and deep learning pipeline designed to interface with a federated network of structured patient data. This proof-of-concept pipeline is disease-agnostic, scalable, and requires little domain expertise and manual feature engineering in order to quickly produce results for the case of a user-defined binary outcome event. We demonstrate the pipeline’s efficacy with three different disease workflows, with high discriminatory power achieved in all cases.},

	abstract = {Robust cancer prognostication can enable more effective patient care and management, which may potentially improve health outcomes. Deep learning has proven to be a powerful tool to extract meaningful information from cancer patient data. In recent years it has displayed promise in quantifying prognostication by predicting patient risk. However, most current deep learning-based cancer prognosis prediction methods use only a single data source and miss out on learning from potentially rich relationships across modalities. Existing multimodal approaches are challenging to interpret in a biological or medical context, limiting real-world clinical integration as a trustworthy prognostic decision aid. Here, we developed a multimodal modeling approach that can integrate information from the central modalities of gene expression, DNA methylation, and histopathological imaging with clinical information for cancer prognosis prediction. Our multimodal modeling approach combines pathway and gene-based sparsely coded layers with patch-based graph convolutional networks to facilitate biological interpretation of the model results. We present a preliminary analysis that compares the potential applicability of combining all modalities to uni- or bi-modal approaches. Leveraging data from four cancer subtypes from the Cancer Genome Atlas, results demonstrate the encouraging performance of our multimodal approach (C-index=0.660 without clinical features; C-index=0.665 with clinical features) across four cancer subtypes versus unimodal approaches and existing state-of-the-art approaches. This work brings insight to the development of interpretable multimodal methods of applying AI to biomedical data and can potentially serve as a foundation for clinical implementations of such software. We plan to follow up this preliminary analysis with an in-depth exploration of factors to improve multimodal modeling approaches on an in-house dataset.},

	abstract = {\textbf{Background:} Pathology reports serve as an auditable trial of a patient’s clinical narrative, containing text pertaining to diagnosis, prognosis, and specimen processing. Recent works have utilized natural language processing (NLP) pipelines, which include rule-based or machine-learning analytics, to uncover textual patterns that inform clinical endpoints and biomarker information. Although deep learning methods have come to the forefront of NLP, there have been limited comparisons with the performance of other machine-learning methods in extracting key insights for the prediction of medical procedure information, which is used to inform reimbursement for pathology departments. In addition, the utility of combining and ranking information from multiple report subfields as compared with exclusively using the diagnostic field for the prediction of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes and signing pathologists remains unclear. \textbf{Methods:} After preprocessing pathology reports, we utilized advanced topic modeling to identify topics that characterize a cohort of 93,039 pathology reports at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine (DPLM). We separately compared XGBoost, SVM, and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers) methodologies for the prediction of primary CPT codes (CPT 88302, 88304, 88305, 88307, 88309) as well as 38 ancillary CPT codes, using both the diagnostic text alone and text from all subfields. We performed similar analyses for characterizing text from a group of the 20 pathologists with the most pathology report sign-outs. Finally, we uncovered important report subcomponents by using model explanation techniques. \textbf{Results:} We identified 20 topics that pertained to diagnostic and procedural information. Operating on diagnostic text alone, BERT outperformed XGBoost for the prediction of primary CPT codes. When utilizing all report subfields, XGBoost outperformed BERT for the prediction of primary CPT codes. Utilizing additional subfields of the pathology report increased prediction accuracy across ancillary CPT codes, and performance gains for using additional report subfields were high for the XGBoost model for primary CPT codes. Misclassifications of CPT codes were between codes of a similar complexity, and misclassifications between pathologists were subspecialty related. \textbf{Conclusions:} Our approach generated CPT code predictions with an accuracy that was higher than previously reported. Although diagnostic text is an important source of information, additional insights may be extracted from other report subfields. Although BERT approaches performed comparably to the XGBoost approaches, they may lend valuable information to pipelines that combine image, text, and -omics information. Future resource-saving opportunities exist to help hospitals detect mis-billing, standardize report text, and estimate productivity metrics that pertain to pathologist compensation (RVUs).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Evaluation for dyssynergia is the most common reason that gastroenterologists refer patients for anorectal manometry, because dyssynergia is amenable to biofeedback by physical therapists. High-definition anorectal manometry (3D-HDAM) is a promising technology to evaluate anorectal physiology, but adoption remains limited by its sheer complexity. We developed a 3D-HDAM deep learning algorithm to evaluate for dyssynergia.
METHODS Spatial-temporal data were extracted from consecutive 3D-HDAM studies performed between 2018-2020 at a tertiary institution. The technical procedure and gold standard definition of dyssynergia were based on the London consensus, adapted to the needs of 3D-HDAM technology. Three machine learning models were generated: (1) traditional machine learning informed by conventional anorectal function metrics, (2) deep learning, and (3) a hybrid approach. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using bootstrap sampling to calculate area-under-the-curve (AUC). To evaluate overfitting, models were validated by adding 502 simulated defecation maneuvers with diagnostic ambiguity.
RESULTS 302 3D-HDAM studies representing 1,208 simulated defecation maneuvers were included (average age 55.2 years; 80.5\% women). The deep learning model had comparable diagnostic accuracy (AUC=0.91 [95\% confidence interval 0.89-0.93]) to traditional (AUC=0.93[0.92-0.95]) and hybrid (AUC=0.96[0.94-0.97]) predictive models in training cohorts. However, the deep learning model handled ambiguous tests more cautiously than other models; the deep learning model was more likely to designate an ambiguous test as inconclusive (odds ratio=4.21[2.78-6.38]) versus traditional/hybrid approaches.
CONCLUSIONS By considering complex spatial-temporal information beyond conventional anorectal function metrics, deep learning on 3D-HDAM technology may enable gastroenterologists to reliably identify and manage dyssynergia in broader practice.},

	abstract = {Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a liver disease characterized by excessive lipid accumulation and disease progression is typically assessed through inspection of a Trichrome stain for Fibrosis staging. As the public health burden of NASH worsens due to evolving lifestyle habits, pathology laboratory resources will become increasingly strained due to rising demand for specialized stains. Virtual staining processes, computational methods which can synthesize the application of chemical staining reagents, can potentially provide resource savings by obviating the need to acquire specialized stains. Virtual staining technologies are assessed by comparing virtual and real tissue stains for their realism and ability to stage. However, these assessment methods are rife with statistical mistreatment of observed phenomena that are difficult to account for. Bridge category ratings represent a phenomenon where a pathologist may assign two adjacent stages simultaneously, which may bias and/or reduce the power of research findings. Such stage assignments were frequently reported in a large-scale assessment of Virtual Trichrome technologies yet were unaccounted for since no statistical adjustment procedures existed. In this work, we provide an updated assessment of Virtual Trichrome technologies using Bridge Category Models, which account for these bridge ratings. We report that two of four pathologists tended to assign lower Fibrosis stages to virtually stained tissue while the other two pathologists assigned similar stages. These research findings differ when bridge ratings are not accounted for. While promising, these results indicate further room for algorithmic finetuning of Virtual Trichrome technologies.},
