	abstract = {This study maps the spread of two cases of COVID-19 conspiracy theories and misinformation in Spanish and French in Latin American and French-speaking communities on Facebook, and thus contributes to understanding the dynamics, reach and consequences of emerging transnational misinformation networks. The findings show that co-sharing behavior of public Facebook groups created transnational networks by sharing videos of Medicos por la Verdad (MPV) conspiracy theories in Spanish and hydroxychloroquine-related misinformation sparked by microbiologist Didier Raoult (DR) in French, usually igniting the surge of locally led interest groups across the Global South. Using inferential methods, the study shows how these networks are enabled primarily by shared cultural and thematic attributes among Facebook groups, effectively creating very large, networked audiences. The study contributes to the understanding of how potentially harmful conspiracy theories and misinformation transcend national borders through non-English speaking online communities, further highlighting the overlooked role of transnationalism in global misinformation diffusion and the potentially disproportionate harm that it causes in vulnerable communities across the globe.},

	abstract = {With globalization's rise, economic interdependence's impacts have become a prominent factor affecting personal lives, as well as national and international dynamics. This study examines RT's public diplomacy efforts on its non-Russian Facebook accounts over the past five years to identify the prominence of economic topics across language accounts. Computational analysis, including word embeddings and statistical methods, investigates how offline economic indicators, like currency values and oil prices, correspond to RT's online economic content changes. The results demonstrate that RT uses message reinforcement associated economic topics as an audience targeting strategy and differentiates their use with changing currency and oil values.},
