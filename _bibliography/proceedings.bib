  abstract  = {A recent paper by P. Reinert et al. [Eur. Phys. J. A54, 86 (2018)] showed a possibility of improving chiral nucleon-nucleon potential models by employing a semi-local regularization in momentum space. The authors derived nucleon-nucleon potentials with this kind of regularization completely up to the fifth order of the chiral expansion and considered additionally some contact interactions which appear at the sixth order. Such a chiral interaction has never been applied to study electromagnetic processes in two- or three-nucleon systems. Here we continue our research of photodisintegration processes, now using the improved chiral force. In particular, we discuss our predictions for the deuteron photodisintegration reaction in the photon energy range up to 100 MeV. The results of our calculations reveal that the new potential yields predictions characterized by a weaker dependence on the regularization parameter and faster convergence with respect to the chiral expansion order compared to the older chiral potentials.}

  abstract    = {The predictions for the differential cross section and the deuteron tensor analyzing power T22 in nucleon-deuteron elastic scattering based on two chiral models of the nucleon-nucleon interaction are presented and compared with each other and with the data. The recent models at the fifth order of the chiral expansion from the Moscow(Idaho)-Salamanca group and from the Bochum group are used. At the energy of the incoming nucleon E=65 MeV both potentials yield similar data descriptions, however the differences between both models become more significant at E=200 MeV. At the latter energy the dependence of predictions on the used value of the regularization parameter becomes important. In particular, this cutoff dependence is much smaller in the case of the semilocally momentum space regularized potential from the Bochum group.}
