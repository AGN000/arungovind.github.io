  abstract  = {Hematoxylin- and eosin (H\&E) stained whole-slide images (WSIs) are the foundation of diagnosis of cancer. In recent years, development of deep learning-based methods in computational pathology enabled the prediction of biomarkers directly from WSIs. However, accurately linking tissue phenotype to biomarkers at scale remains a crucial challenge for democratizing complex biomarkers in precision oncology. This protocol describes a practical workflow for solid tumor associative modeling in pathology (STAMP), enabling prediction of biomarkers directly from WSIs using deep learning. The STAMP workflow is biomarker agnostic and allows for genetic- and clinicopathologic tabular data to be included as an additional input, together with histopathology images. The protocol consists of five main stages which have been successfully applied to various research problems: formal problem definition, data preprocessing, modeling, evaluation and clinical translation. The STAMP workflow differentiates itself through its focus on serving as a collaborative framework that can be used by clinicians and engineers alike for setting up research projects in the field of computational pathology. As an example task, we applied STAMP to the prediction of microsatellite instability (MSI) status in colorectal cancer, showing accurate performance for the identification of MSI-high tumors. Moreover, we provide an open-source codebase which has been deployed at several hospitals across the globe to set up computational pathology workflows. The STAMP workflow requires one workday of hands-on computational execution and basic command line knowledge.},

  abstract  = {Deep learning is revolutionising pathology, offering novel opportunities in disease prognosis and personalised treatment. Historically, stain normalisation has been a crucial preprocessing step in computational pathology pipelines, and persists into the deep learning era. Yet, with the emergence of feature extractors trained using self-supervised learning (SSL) on diverse pathology datasets, we call this practice into question. In an empirical evaluation of publicly available feature extractors, we find that omitting stain normalisation and image augmentations does not compromise downstream performance, while incurring substantial savings in memory and compute. Further, we show that the top-performing feature extractors are remarkably robust to variations in stain and augmentations like rotation in their latent space. Contrary to previous patch-level benchmarking studies, our approach emphasises clinical relevance by focusing on slide-level prediction tasks in a weakly supervised setting with external validation cohorts. This work represents the most comprehensive robustness evaluation of public pathology SSL feature extractors to date, involving more than 6,000 training runs across nine tasks, five datasets, three downstream architectures, and various preprocessing setups. Our findings stand to streamline digital pathology workflows by minimising preprocessing needs and informing the selection of feature extractors.},

  abstract  = {Traditional supervised learning tasks require a label for every instance in the training set, but in many real-world applications, labels are only available for collections (bags) of instances. This problem setting, known as multiple instance learning (MIL), is particularly relevant in the medical domain, where high-resolution images are split into smaller patches, but labels apply to the image as a whole. Recent MIL models are able to capture correspondences between patches by employing self-attention, allowing them to weigh each patch differently based on all other patches in the bag. However, these approaches still do not consider the relative spatial relationships between patches within the larger image, which is especially important in computational pathology. To this end, we introduce a novel MIL model with distance-aware self-attention (DAS-MIL), which explicitly takes into account relative spatial information when modelling the interactions between patches. Unlike existing relative position representations for self-attention which are discrete, our approach introduces continuous distance-dependent terms into the computation of the attention weights, and is the first to apply relative position representations in the context of MIL. We evaluate our model on a custom MNIST-based MIL dataset that requires the consideration of relative spatial information, as well as on CAMELYON16, a publicly available cancer metastasis detection dataset, where we achieve a test AUROC score of 0.91. On both datasets, our model outperforms existing MIL approaches that employ absolute positional encodings, as well as existing relative position representation schemes applied to MIL. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/das-mil.},

Usually, ML models trained on local data are failing to reach their full potential owing to low statistical power. Federated Learning (FL) solves critical issues in the healthcare domain such as data privacy and enables multiple contributors to build a common and robust ML model by sharing local learning parameters without sharing data. FL approaches are mainly evaluated in the literature using benchmarks and the trade-off between accuracy and privacy still has to be more studied in a realistic clinical context. In this work, part of the European project KATY (GA:101017453), we evaluate this trade-off for a CD3/CD8 cells staining procedure from Hoechst images. WÃ¶lflein et al. developed a deep learning GAN model that synthesizes CD3 and CD8 stains from kidney cancer tissue slides, trained on 473,000 patches (256x256 pixels) from 8 whole slide images. We modified the training to simulate a FL approach by distributing the learning across 8 clients and aggregating the parameters to create the overall model. We present then the performance comparison between FL and centralized learning.},

  abstract       = {In recent years, there has been an increased effort to digitise whole-slide images of cancer tissue. This effort has opened up a range of new avenues for the application of deep learning in oncology. One such avenue is virtual staining, where a deep learning model is tasked with reproducing the appearance of stained tissue sections, conditioned on a different, often times less expensive, input stain. However, data to train such models in a supervised manner where the input and output stains are aligned on the same tissue sections are scarce. In this work, we introduce a dataset of ten whole-slide images of clear cell renal cell carcinoma tissue sections counterstained with Hoechst 33342, CD3, and CD8 using multiple immunofluorescence. We also provide a set of over 600,000 patches of size 256 Ã 256 pixels extracted from these images together with cell segmentation masks in a format amenable to training deep learning models. It is our hope that this dataset will be used to further the development of deep learning methods for digital pathology by serving as a dataset for comparing and benchmarking virtual staining models.},

We present a framework to virtually stain Hoechst images (which are cheap and widespread) with both CD3 and CD8 to identify T cell subtypes in clear cell renal cell carcinoma using generative adversarial networks. Our proposed method jointly learns both staining tasks, incentivising the network to incorporate mutually beneficial information from each task.

  abstract       = {Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have significantly improved the oncological outcomes, about one-third of patients affected by clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) still experience recurrence. Current prognostic algorithms, such as the Leibovich score (LS), rely on morphological features manually assessed by pathologists and are therefore subject to bias. Moreover, these tools do not consider the heterogeneous molecular milieu present in the Tumour Microenvironment (TME), which may have prognostic value. We systematically developed a semi-automated method to investigate 62 markers and their combinations in 150 primary ccRCCs using Multiplex Immunofluorescence (mIF), NanoString GeoMx&reg; Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted image analysis in order to find novel prognostic signatures and investigate their spatial relationship. We found that coexpression of cancer stem cell (CSC) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers such as OCT4 and ZEB1 are indicative of poor outcome. OCT4 and the immune markers CD8, CD34, and CD163 significantly stratified patients at intermediate LS. Furthermore, augmenting the LS with OCT4 and CD34 improved patient stratification by outcome. Our results support the hypothesis that combining molecular markers has prognostic value and can be integrated with morphological features to improve risk stratification and personalised therapy. To conclude, GeoMx&reg; DSP and AI image analysis are complementary tools providing high multiplexing capability required to investigate the TME of ccRCC, while reducing observer bias.},

However, such algorithms often converge to suboptimal weight configurations known as local minima. This report presents a novel minimal example of the local minimum problem with only three training samples and demonstrates its suitability for investigating and resolving said problem by analysing its mathematical properties and conditions leading to the failure of conventional training regimes. A different perspective for training neural networks is introduced that concerns itself with neural spaces and is applied to study the local minimum example.This gives rise to the concept of setting intermediate subgoals during training which is demonstrated to be a viable and effective means of overcoming the local minimum problem. The versatility of subgoal-based approaches is highlighted by showing their potential for training more generally. An example of a subgoal-based training regime using sampling and an adaptive clothoid for establishing a goal-connecting path is suggested as a proof of concept for further research. In addition, this project includes the design and implementation of a software framework for monitoring the performance of different neural training algorithms on a given problem simultaneously and in real time. This framework can be used to reproduce the findings of how classical algorithms fail to find the global minimum in the aforementioned example.}
