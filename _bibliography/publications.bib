  abstract  = {The presence and density of specific types of immune cells are important to understand a patient's immune response to cancer. However, immunofluorescence staining required to identify T cell subtypes is expensive, timeconsuming, and rarely performed in clinical settings. We present a framework to virtually stain Hoechst images (which are cheap and widespread) with both CD3 and CD8 to identify T cell subtypes in clear cell renal cell carcinoma using generative adversarial networks. Our proposed method jointly learns both staining tasks, incentivising the network to incorporate mutually beneficial information from each task. We devise a novel metric to quantify the virtual staining quality, and use it to evaluate our method.},

  abstract       = {Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have significantly improved the oncological outcomes, about one-third of patients affected by clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) still experience recurrence. Current prognostic algorithms, such as the Leibovich score (LS), rely on morphological features manually assessed by pathologists and are therefore subject to bias. Moreover, these tools do not consider the heterogeneous molecular milieu present in the Tumour Microenvironment (TME), which may have prognostic value. We systematically developed a semi-automated method to investigate 62 markers and their combinations in 150 primary ccRCCs using Multiplex Immunofluorescence (mIF), NanoString GeoMx&reg; Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted image analysis in order to find novel prognostic signatures and investigate their spatial relationship. We found that coexpression of cancer stem cell (CSC) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers such as OCT4 and ZEB1 are indicative of poor outcome. OCT4 and the immune markers CD8, CD34, and CD163 significantly stratified patients at intermediate LS. Furthermore, augmenting the LS with OCT4 and CD34 improved patient stratification by outcome. Our results support the hypothesis that combining molecular markers has prognostic value and can be integrated with morphological features to improve risk stratification and personalised therapy. To conclude, GeoMx&reg; DSP and AI image analysis are complementary tools providing high multiplexing capability required to investigate the TME of ccRCC, while reducing observer bias.},

  abstract    = {Gradient methods based on backpropagation are widely used in training multilayer feedforward neural networks. However, such algorithms often converge to suboptimal weight configurations known as local minima. This report presents a novel minimal example of the local minimum problem with only three training samples and demonstrates its suitability for investigating and resolving said problem by analysing its mathematical properties and conditions leading to the failure of conventional training regimes. A different perspective for training neural networks is introduced that concerns itself with neural spaces and is applied to study the local minimum example.This gives rise to the concept of setting intermediate subgoals during training which is demonstrated to be a viable and effective means of overcoming the local minimum problem. The versatility of subgoal-based approaches is highlighted by showing their potential for training more generally. An example of a subgoal-based training regime using sampling and an adaptive clothoid for establishing a goal-connecting path is suggested as a proof of concept for further research. In addition, this project includes the design and implementation of a software framework for monitoring the performance of different neural training algorithms on a given problem simultaneously and in real time. This framework can be used to reproduce the findings of how classical algorithms fail to find the global minimum in the aforementioned example.}
