  abstract = {This research evaluates the impact of the Pension 65 Program on the hours worked in the main occupation of older adults. In urban areas the program seems to have a greater impact; possibly due to a greater supply of available jobs that would allow a reduction in the number of working hours. However, for rural areas the program does not find a significant effect. The economic situation or the composition of the household could be a determining factor in this behavior. In these areas, it is suggested to evaluate the application of various programs. Perhaps, the joint application of these is necessary to achieve an increase in the rest time of the elderly population in rural areas.},
