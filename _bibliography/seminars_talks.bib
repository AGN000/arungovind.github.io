@misc{2018-Graz,
	abbr = {Uni Graz},
	abstract = {In this talk I will present the results obtained in a recent paper in collaboration with Mariapia Palombaro and Marcello Ponsiglione. 
The aim of this paper is to describe polycrystalline structures from the variational point of view. Grain boundaries and the corresponding grain orientations are not introduced as internal variables of the energy, but they spontaneously arise as a result of energy minimisation, under suitable boundary conditions. 

We work under the hypothesis of linear planar elasticity, with the reference configuration $\Om \subset \R^2$ representing a section of an infinite cylindrical crystal. The elastic energy functional $E_\e$ depends on the lattice spacing $\e$ of the crystal and we allow $N_\e$ \textit{edge dislocations} in the reference configuration, with $N_\e \to \infty$ as $\e \to 0$. Each dislocation contributes by a factor $|\log \e|$ to the elastic energy, so that the natural rescaling for the energy functional is $N_\e |\log \e|$. We work in the energy regime
\[
N_\e \gg |\log \e| \,.
\]
We will see that this energy regime will account for polycrystals containing grains that are mutually rotated by an \textit{infinitesimal} angle $\theta \approx 0$. 


Specifically, we show that the energy functional $E_\e$, rescaled by $N_\e |\log \e|$, \mbox{$\Gamma$-converges} as $\e \to 0$ to a certain functional $\mathcal{F}$, whose dependence on the \textit{elastic} and \textit{plastic} parts of the macroscopic strain is \textit{decoupled}. 
Imposing \textit{piecewise constant} Dirichlet boundary conditions on the plastic part of the limit strain, we then show that $\mathcal{F}$ is minimised by strains that are \textit{locally constant} and take values into the set of \textit{antisymmetric matrices}. We call these strains \textit{linearised polycrystals}.},
