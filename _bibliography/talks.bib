	abbr = {CMU},
	abstract = {We propose and analyze a simple variational model for dislocations at semi-coherent interfaces. The energy functional describes  the competition between two terms: a surface energy induced by dislocations that compensate the lattice misfit at the interface,  and a far field elastic energy, spent to  decrease the amount of  needed dislocations. We prove that the former scales like the surface area of the interface, the latter like its diameter.  


The proposed continuum model is deduced from some heuristic derivation from the semi-discrete theory of dislocations. Even if we deal with finite elasticity, linearized elasticity naturally emerges in our analysis since the far field strain vanishes as the interface size increases.},
