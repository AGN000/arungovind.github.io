  abstract = {This paper studies the short-rum and long-run effects of foreign aid and foreign direct investment on economic growth in emerging markets. Upon applying the so-called Pooled Mean Group estimator to an unbalanced panel for 94 countries over the period 1960-2012, we find a positive and significant long-run relationship between these two types of foreign capital and growth. We then enquire which type of foreign flow is more effective to stimulate economic growth, and find that both effects are not statistically different in various dynamic specifications and robustness checks. This finding may account for a possible substitutability relationship between foreign aid and foreign direct investment in the long-run. An implication is that what matter for growth in emerging markets is the aggregate amount of foreign capital, rather than its composition.},

  abstract = {Developing countries are facing the Covid-19 epidemic with particular challenges, such as their economic and labor force composition. In this research I will extend the so-called SIR-macro model with demand and supply effects to study how the size of the informal sector impact the ability of these countries to respond to the epidemic. Lockdown policies are useful to control the health crisis but these are less effective in informal markets. As a result, infection and death rates will not decrease as expected, and since informal activities are not counted in the calculation of the GDP, this would exacerbate the size of the recession. Finally, in order to generate similar results to an economy with only formal markets, the economy with informal markets has to implement more severe containment policies.},
