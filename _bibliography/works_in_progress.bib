  abstract={We investigate the effects of homophily in social networks, i.e. the tendency of individuals to interact with members of their own group on ethnic relations between minority and majority groups on social media. We make use of a novel data on religious identities of nearly 700,000 twitter users to measure polarization between Hindus and Muslims on COVID-19 related discourse in India. We examine how polarization evolves with pandemic induced lockdowns in 2020 and document several interesting empirical findings. The affinity towards their own community is higher among people who exclusively interact with members of their own religion. The difference, however, disappears in the week post the first lockdown. The results show how adverse events change the dynamics of religious polarization, and thus, have important implications for ethnic conflict.}

  title={LCHQA-Summ: Multi-perspective Summarization of Publicly Sourced Consumer Health Answers},
  author={Bhattacharya, Abari*, Chaturvedi, Rochana and Yadav, Shweta},
  year={2022},
  abstract={Community question answering forums provide a convenient platform for people to source answers to their questions including those related to healthcare from the general public. The answers to user queries are generally long and contain multiple different perspectives, redundancy or irrelevant answers. This presents a novel challenge for domain-specific concise and correct multi-answer summarization. Towards this we propose to (i) develop a novel gold standard Laymen-sourced Consumer Health Question Answer Summaries (LCHQA-Summ) dataset with summaries covering the breadth of perspectives across various healthcare topics. (ii) devise an automated health answer summarization pipeline to generate perspective-specific answer summaries}
