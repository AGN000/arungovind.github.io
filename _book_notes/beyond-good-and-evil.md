- **The will to power**: the natural instinct/drive of each individual to define and express their own values, i.e., what is worth pursuing in life
- **The overman**: the individual who fully expresses their will to power, i.e., defines what is worth pursuing for them and pursues it with passion and discipline
- **Eternal recurrence**: as a thought experiment, how would you live if every moment of your life was repeated for eternity?
- **Becoming the overman is a process** that
    - is creative and positive/affirmative: every day you must decide who to become, what to build
    - involves concrete action and achievement, striving for greatness and becoming an example of what humanity can produce at its best, whether it be through political action, written thought, arts, science, etc.
    - is **instinctive and passionate (Dionysian)** — what you value should express your instincts, it cannot be derived analytically, and whatever you decide to pursue, you should embrace it fully
    - **requires reason and discipline (Apollonian)** — both in deciding your values (critical thinking and questioning of basic assumptions to trim down undue influences) and expressing them (whatever standard you set for yourself, you have to uphold)
    - never ends: living is the process of becoming, you must keep striving to become the overman until you die
- The overman is defined in contradiction to
    - destructive nihilism 
    - the individual who inherits pre-baked values (in particular morality: what is good or bad/evil) from others (religion, culture)
    - in particular, the devout Christian whose morality is defined by the Church / God, it suppresses fully living this life (feeling bad about being a sinner, what a total waste of life), leading to resentment towards others who express themselves fully, in favor of a hypothetical future life in paradise
    - at the worse point in Europe’s history, the herd mentality thinks that Christian morality is the one true morality and all those who disagree are wrong and should be corrected/punished (crusades against Muslims, Christian/Protestant wars, conquest of South America by Spain, etc.)
- There’s a lot more to unpack here on the “master” vs. “slave/herd” morality
    - Master morality
        - good = noble, potent, capable
        - bad = contemptible, impotent, incapable
    - Slave/herd morality
        - good = loving, kindness, pity, non threatening
        - bad = evil
        - emerged by opposition to master morality, does not stand on its own
    - In Nietzsche's mind, Master morality is exemplified by ancient Greece and slave morality by Christianity; the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality) is very good
- It’s harder to get a clear positive description of an overman
    - Maybe he avoids being prescriptive to leave more room for the reader to be creative in the process of becoming
    - The few examples he gives are great military leaders like Cesar or Napoleon, who I understand to be largely driven by ego: the desire to be recognized as great by their contemporaries and future generations
    - This leads to easily misunderstanding his “will to power” concept as being a literal thirst for power in the conventional sense of the term
    - But the concept of will to power and overman is much broader than this and could be applied to any set of values that is creative, positive, and “embraces life”
    - My working definition: human beings who build their own path that is creative, affirmative, passionate, disciplined
