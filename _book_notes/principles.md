Embrace reality and deal with it
- Be hyperrealist - pursue **practical dreams** that lead to human progress and avoid impractical idealism 
- We **learn and evolve through a feedback loop** of doing stuff (building stuff, making decisions) and getting feedback from reality (outcomes, feedback from others)
- Accelerate this process by iterating fast, giving yourself more surface for feedback, targeting it to where you need it most, and making the best of it 
  - **Be radically transparent** - be yourself, don’t be afraid to put your ideas out there
  - **Be radically open-minded** - seek ideas and feedback that contradict your view of the world and yourself (from believable sources)
  - **Embrace failure and pain** - seek challenging situations, take the time to reflect on the pain that comes with failure
  - **Take full responsibility** for your outcomes - avoiding accountability protects your ego but prevents you from learning 
  - **Acknowledge your weaknesses** - you can turn them into strengths, delegate your way out of them, or redefine what you do to get around them, but don’t ignore them 
- Equations
  - Dreams + reality + determination = impact
  - Pain + reflection = progress

Five step iterative process to get what you want out of life
- The process  
  - Have clear goals - prioritize ruthlessly
  - Identify and don’t tolerate problems - they are opportunities for improvement
  - Diagnose problems to get at their root causes - look at yourself and the people your work with as objectively as possible 
  - Design a plan - going through the planning process is more important than details of the plan, it surfaces potential problems and brings accountability (who does what by when)
  - Push through to completion - establish clear metrics, don’t lose sight of the goals while executing
- Clearly delineate between steps
- Be clear about where in the process you are weakest and work or around it

Be radically open-minded
- The two biggest barriers to good decision making are your ego and your blind spots 
- Cultivate the humility to recognize that you often don’t know - an ability to deal with this fact is one of the most important capabilities you can develop 
- Decision making is a two step process: first take in all relevant information (by asking the right questions to believable people while suspending judgment), then decide 
- Appreciate the **art of thoughtful disagreement**: the objective is not to convince the other person but to arrive at the truth together - ask questions, stay calm and dispassionate, describe back what you’re hearing, don’t interrupt 
- Determine whether you should act as a student, a teacher, or a peer depending on your level of believability 
- Triangulate your views with believable people who are willing to disagree - thoughtful disagreement with an expert or between experts is the best way to learn 
- Recognize the signs of closed and open mindedness 
  - Defensiveness vs. curiosity about conflicting opinions
  - Statements vs. questions
  - Focus on being understood vs. understanding others 
  - Spend more time speaking vs. listening 
  - Overconfidence vs. humility 
- How to become radically open-minded?
  - Use feelings of anger or frustration as cues to slow down 
  - Get to know your blind spots - record the situations in which you’ve made bad decisions 
  - When a number of believable people disagree with you, assume you are probably biased
