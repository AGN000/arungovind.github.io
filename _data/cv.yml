        - title: Core Product Development
          contents:
            - Conceptualized and created an interactive tool to qualitatively code thousands of open-ended responses into quantifiable themes, delivering $10M in public opinion research between 2019-2021
            - Created an interface that enabled analysts to combine and interact audience responses, decreasing analysis time by 50%
            - Built a data visualization interface using Visx, enabling analysts to visualize as many as 10K responses in half the time
            - Integrated AWS Mechanical Turk into the core product, reducing the time taken to use the service by 4x
        - title: Methodological Testing and Prototyping
          contents:
            - Designed, implemented, and standardized the weighting methodology for sample collection, increasing accuracy and precision by 15%
            - Streamlined data ingestion and collection by writing custom R packages and Python integrations with external vendor APIs, increasing project capacity by 4x
            - Built a prototype SurveyMonkey integration, enabling analysts to field surveys twice as fast during the last two weeks of the 2020 US Presidential Cycle
            - Conducted NLP experiments testing annotation approaches on open-ended text data, spanning thousands of responses
