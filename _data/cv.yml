    - title: Software Engineer I
      institution: Avalanche Insights
      year: 2020-2021
      description:
      - Worked on a visualization interface using Visx reducing the time needed for preliminary data exploration by 2x
      - Integrated an AWS service into the core product (backend and frontend) reducing the time taken to use the service by 4x
      - Built a quick integration in response to increased business during the final two weeks of the 2020 election to enable our analysts to deliver 2x the work
      - Helped build an interface that allowed users to process long surveys with thousands of responses
      - Liaised with external vendors whose services we were considering; held these relationships once we were onboarded
      - Conducted technical interviews for software engineering candidates
    - title: Technical Analyst
      institution: Avalanche Insights
      year: 2019-2020
      description:
      - Designed, implemented, and standardized weighting methodology for sample collection in consultations with the Statistician, the CTO, and a review of survey literature in the political polling space 
      - Streamlined data ingestion and collection to increase project capacity 4x by writing custom R packages and Python integrations with external vendor APIs
      - Built a prototype using Shiny to show how a more automated ingestion process might work
      - Conducted nlp experiments testing various annotation approaches on large volumes of open-ended text data using Spacy
      - Made direct contributions to the engineering team by building some of these tools that I built and maintained externally directly into the core product
