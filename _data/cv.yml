      institution: Northestern University, Shenyang, China
      year: 2021.04 - Present
      description:
        - title: Research Purpose
          contents:
            - Solve the single image super-resolution algorithm based on deep learning from the following two aspects
            - Adopt Transformer Encoder to abstract global features and apply it to whole image patches.
            - Add new constraint to shrink hypothesis space to find a more reasonable convergence position.
        - title: Research Achievements
          contents:
            - Designed a new model which the performance on test set is in the first echelon, and the details of the model need to be optimized.
            - Coded a deep learning training and testing system based on PyTorch.
            - Summarized the two main directions to solve super resolution problem.
            - Familiar with low-level visual tasks, structured learning program, and basic model of CNN, Transformer, GAN, etc.
