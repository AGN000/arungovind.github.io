    - title: Metafictional Interaction Design and Player Experience in Virtual Reality
      year: 08.2022 - present
#      description:
#        - Conducting formal analysis of VR and non-VR metafictional games, focusing on the interactions of these games to achieve breaking the fourth wall effect, currently expanding the number of games being analyzed.
#        - Designed and developed a prototype of VR metafictional game, wrote game scripts and game plots.
#        - Implemented in-game interactions (applying eye tracking and motion sensing), using Unity and plugins.
#        - Currently evaluating the player experience of my designed VR metafictional game in a within-subjects user study (using SUS, GEQ and semi-structured interview).
