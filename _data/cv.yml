    - title: Deep Learning Intern
      institution: Enlitic Inc, San Fransico, CA, USA
      year: 2021
      description:
        - Designed a new multi-label classification model capable of leveraging visual and characteristic similarity
          of the disease during training to enhance the model’s performance. Moreover, in close collaboration with
          Enlitic’s radiology team, I designed a new augmentation pipeline that mimics the lightning situation that
          radiologists use in their daily decisions for each disease. The pipeline improved model training and the
          final model’s accuracy
