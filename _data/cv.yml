    - title: Master of Science - Computational Linguistics
      institution: Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran
      year: 2011 - 2014
      description: 
        - My thesis topic was on Automatic Authorship Attribution.  
          I studied the stylistic features of four renowned
          Iranian blank verse poets (Sohrab Sepehri, Fereidoon Moshiri, Mehdi Akhavan Sales, 
          and Forough Farrokhzad). Using statistical analysis, I identified the unique features
          in their works and matched unknown texts to each poet. 
          It was a fascinating exploration of the intricate nuances that 
          define an author's unique voice and style.
