    - title: Post-doctoral Research Trainee in Computational & Systems Biology
      institution: Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN
      year: Current
      description:
        - Advisors- Vito Quaranta, M.D. and Scott Hiebert, Ph.D.
        - Analyzing chromatin accessibility and transcriptomics datasets (scATAC-seq & scRNA-seq) to understand epigenetic regulation of lung cancer phenotypes. Facilitating collaboration between two labs at Vanderbilt to plan experimental design and coordinate omics data collection. The goal of this project is to combine computational modeling and bioinformatics tools to predict lineage drivers for variant SCLC models. 
    - title: Data Science Intern
      institution: Decode Health, Nashville, TN
      year: Current
      description:
        - Developing pipelines for data processing and analysis such as feature selection, machine learning models, and visualization. Decode Health is a healthcare AI company that unlocks discovery with data.
    - title: Graduate Student Researcher
      institution: Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN
      year: 2017-2022
      description: 
        - Dissertation- Network Control of Cell Identity and Plasticity in Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)
        - Developed and applied a network inference algorithm to determine the epigenetic regulation and stability of phenotypic subtypes of SCLC. Developed a bioinformatics pipeline for analyzing changes in cell identity (scRNA-seq) in classic and variant models of SCLC. Overall, this project led to insights into how intratumoral heterogeneity and plasticity may allow SCLC tumors to overcome therapy and gain resistance.
    - title: Graduate Student Researcher, Laboratory Rotations
      institution: Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN
      year: 2016-2017
      description:
        - Completed four 8-week rotations in labs studying myosin tracking to tips of microvilli, effect of ECM stiffness on cancer cell growth, modeling of drug-induced dynamics in melanoma, and fetal membrane developmental dynamics.
    - title: Undergraduate Student Researcher
      institution: College of William & Mary, Nashville, TN
      year: 2015-2016
      description:
        - Senior Thesis- Quantitative Analysis of Vital Signs in Premature Infants
        - Programmed a biophysical 'Query User Data Interface' in MATLAB for the Apnea of Prematurity group at UVA and William & Mary. The goal of this project was to streamline data acquirement for the neonatal intensive care unit at UVA.
