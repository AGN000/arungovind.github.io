      institution: Polytechnic University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain
      year: 2024
      description:
        - The main objective of the thesis is to identify environmental impacts of innovative syntheses for chemical production. The thesis will be developed in collaboration with the Swiss company DEASYL, which is a technology provider, relying on innovations, new horizons in mineral chemistry and organic chemistry. The research is hosted at the UNESCO Chair in Life Cycle and Climate Change facility at UPF-ESCI building in Barcelona. Close collaboration between the UNESCO Chair and the company was established in 2021.
        - DEASYL will provide their support in the collection of necessary data and providing an overview of the chemical processes under evaluation. Furthermore, Life Cycle Assessments for chemical processes (from other companies) which are to be developed by the UNESCO Chair during the doctorate period (2021-2024) may be added to the final thesis regarding they fit with the contents and the complexity required in the report.
