- title: "Is That the Way? How Tourism Reshapes Communities and Erodes Social Capital"
  # authors: "Maycas-Sardi"
  abstract: "Does economic revitalization foster collective action? This article examines how tourism reshapes community social capital, focusing on its impact on political and local participation. While tourism can revitalize communities, it often disrupts local embeddedness—the community’s social interrelations and civic engagement. Leveraging a quasi-experimental context, I analyze the effects of a massive tourism boom triggered by the international promotion of the Way of Saint James (Camino de Santiago) as a tourist route. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, I find that touristification adversely impacts local embeddedness. Specifically, local association density and electoral participation decline in municipalities exposed to tourism. These changes are driven by two mechanisms: (a) congestion—hostels tend to crowd urban centers, the main social hubs where social activity takes place, and (b) compositional changes, as younger, mobile, and temporary workers replace older native residents. This change has eroded local embeddedness, as shown by reduced community participation in social and political affairs."

  abstract: "More than two million evictions occur in the US annually, with profound and lasting consequences for the families and communities affected. This paper examines how the closure of brick-and-mortar bank branches in the US affected the number of households threatened with evictions from 2000-2018. To overcome the potential endogeneity associated with branch closures, we adopt an instrumental variable (IV) identification strategy that uses bank mergers as an instrument of the distance between the population and bank branches at the census tract level. Our results show that interstate and intercounty mergers positively and significantly affected the distance to the closest bank branches. Moreover, we find that a 1% increase in the distance to the closest branch generated a 2.3% increase in the number of households threatened with eviction. The effects in urban tracts primarily drive this result. We complement our analysis with several robustness checks, including a matching procedure to control for pre-existing observable differences between tracts exposed and unexposed to mergers. Moreover, we re-estimate our model focusing on mergers where the acquiring and the acquired banks had overlapping branches within the same tract, and we consider different measures of financial exclusion and exposition to evictions."
