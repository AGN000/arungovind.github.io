### A few words about me

I am a 3-d year Ph.D. student at the Jagiellonian University in *theoretical nuclear physics department*. I moved to Poland ~3 years ago because I was offered a Ph.D. position here. My main topic is Few-Body weak nuclear interactions *[, specifically Deuteron, Tritium and Helium photodisintegration]*.

I have a side project where I do numerical simulations of the detector measurements. Also I carried out a few minor projects in a private organization where I worked with basic Machine Learning and NLP techniques.

I am going to finish my study soon and I want to develop in the direction of ML and AI as I became very interested in that. So that's why I'm here.

### Experience

[Bachelor and master's - traveling wave reactor]\
[Ph.D. - theoreticall physics.]


On my second year, I have joined another group as a side project. *[This group is called a SiFi-CC which stands for SiPM and heavy scintillation Fiber-based Compton Camera.]*
Nowadays, one of the cancer treatment methods is a proton therapy.
Our group is developing a detector which allows to monitor a deposited dose in a real-time.
I am responsible for one of 2 detector setups - Coded Mask.
In this mode coded aperture is used to reconstruct the source position.
At the current stage, I am preparing simulations of the radiation procedure and further reconstruction of the source information.

Also, during the last years, I've carried out minor projects in a private organization.
My first task was to prepare the software that was supposed to automize the calibration procedure of the device.

Thanks to that work I became interested in Data Science and Machine Learning.
I took a Data Science course at the university.
Then I discovered Python for myself and found this language to be much more powerful than GNU Octave(Matlab open-source version), which I used before for similar purposes. It motivated me to complite several online courses on Python and Data-Science (more then 5).

My second task at the company was connected to NLP. I signed a contract, which doesn’t allow me to tell any details about that project but in general, I had been processing a large text database.


*I am quit a versitile person in terms of my knowledge and skills.*
<hr>

### *Why don't I work regularly on IF*

*The company is quite small and they do not have many projects for me. If they offer me a project - I try to do it.*

<hr>

### Why should we hire you?

To be honest, when I found the offer, I realized that it's an ideal position for me. 
I think that the requirements match my skills and interests `perfectly` what happens not so often.

For example:
* Python, Bash
* Linux
* C++
* Interest in ML, NLP, AI
* Expirience in text processing

<hr>

### Why do I want to get this position

I hope that this position would provide me with an `valuable` experience and I would develop my professional skills.

I like trying something new and challange myself, that's why I would be happy to have any  possible business trips. Also I do not mind working remotely as I have a dream to see the world.

*I am interested in the long-term cooperation.*

<hr>

### Javascript -> Fast Learner

I have received a task to prepare a javascript applets on statistics. At that time I didn't know that language at all. During 7 months a learned JS and prepared 10 applets.


<hr>

### My weak and strong sides

#### Strong

* **Fast-learner and quick-witted**\
*It's not a problem for me to make myself familiar with different tools and use them immediately.*
*I prefer learning-by-doing.*

* **Adaptible, flexible**\
*Moved to another country and adapted here. Took part in projects from different physics areas*

* **Responsible, well-organized, meet deadlines**\
*I helped to organize a conference in Kraków. I have a teaching experience. I was conducting practical part of statistical classes for students in Jagiellonian University.*

* **Conscientious**\
*I want to know in details what I'm doing and to understand all the processes fully.*

* **Calm, Level-headed, Sensible, Rational**\
*You can ask my wife to make sure*

#### Weak

* **Not really talkative and sociable person, shy**\
*I am not the person to start the conversation first. It sometimes takes me time to blend in the group.*
*As the reason of it, I am a bit shy.*

* **Competitive**\
*I always want to be the best. Sometimes I spend to much time on unneccessary things just to overcome other people's results. As a consequence I like playing competitive games like chess, ping-pong, football and volleyball.*

* **I work better when my achivements and merits are recognized**\
*It helps me to keep motivation when I am being praised.*

### Family

I moved to Poland with my wife.
She is a language teacher in a private school (ProfiLingua).

<hr>

### Are you a team player?

Example: Weekly meetings with SiFi-CC.

<hr>

### What has disappointed you about work?

I once felt that I was not being given enough challenges to work on. I was a bit disappointed because I was so eager to go for more.****

<hr>


### My plans, hobbies, dreams


#### Professional

I'd like to find a position where I will be able to make maximum use of my skills and knowledge to solve non-trivial puzzles and to be on the frontier of human technologies *[I love Samsung]*.

#### Private

* I dream about travelling around the world `to enlarge my cultural background`. I hope that current pandemic will improve quality of the remote work and long-distance communication.

* I like playing sport games: volleyball, football, ping-pong and chess. Also I love climbing, mountaineering and snowboarding. I am a big fan of classic literature, especially Dostoyevski and Remark. I play guitar.

<hr>

###  Describe the workplace where you’ll be most happy and productive

 I like workplaces that emphasize both autonomy and teamwork. I like collaborating with others and exchanging ideas, but I also want to have `flexibility to work` uninterrupted for some time.

 *Apreciate flexible hours*
 
 *The only dream job I’ve always had was a job that keeps me busy, a job wherein I get to contribute to the company’s success.*

<hr>

### What are your salary expectations?

As of now, I haven’t thought much about it. I’m more focused on learning the requirements for this position that I am applying for. 

*I’ve done some research on the average salaries for this type of role in my area and I think I would expect this role to pay between 3000 and 6000. But I think it depands on the number of working hours per month. Could you tell me the salary range you have in mind?*

<hr>

### Questions

* When should I expect the news from your side?

* Will there be an answer in the case of negative answer?

* Type of the contract (Internship and after)
