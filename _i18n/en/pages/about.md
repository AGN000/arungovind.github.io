Hello! 

My name is Matheus, and I'm a philosopher interested in episodic memory, cognition, and neuroscience!

Currently, I'm a PhD student in the Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology ([PNP](https://pnp.wustl.edu/)) Program at Washington University in St Louis :us:

I completed my Master's and Bachelor's degrees at the beautiful Federal University of Santa Maria ([UFSM](https://www.ufsm.br)), in Brazil :brazil:

The focus of my work is primarily on philosophy of memory and the philosophy of neuroscience :brain:

You can find out more about my research by taking a look at [my CV](/cv/), or my [PhilPeople page](https://philpeople.org/profiles/matheus-diesel-werberich).
