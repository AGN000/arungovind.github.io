Hello! 

My name is Matheus, and I'm a philosopher interested in episodic memory, cognition, and neuroscience!

Currently, I'm completing my Master's degree at the beautiful Federal University of Santa Maria ([UFSM](https://www.ufsm.br)), in Brazil :brazil:

The focus of my current work is how mechanistic crtieria of constitution can help us to delineate the neurocognitive systems for episodic memory and imagination. 

You can find out more about my research by taking a look at [my CV](/cv/), or my [PhilPeople page](https://philpeople.org/profiles/matheus-diesel-werberich).
