Hey there! Welcome to my online homepage.

I am a researcher in the field of Environmental Sciences and Green Chemistry. I am currently finishing up my PhD studies with the [UNESCO Chair in Life Cycle and Climate Change ESCI-UPF](https://www.esci.upf.edu/en/unesco-chair-in-life-cycle-and-climate-change/catedra-introduction) and the Swiss company, [Deasyl SA](https://deasyl.com/). My focus is on investigating the Life Cycle Assessment of innovative chemical processes in the field of mechanochemistry and sharing my findings with the world.

But my passions don't stop there. I am a big believer in using sustainability and technology to make a difference, which is why I've taken on a few side projects:

- I was part of the team that founded [CuidaPro](https://cuida-pro.com/), a home care company for the elderly in the Ebro Delta. I still work with them as Digital Strategy Manager, helping to bring top-notch care to the region.

- In addition, I'm in the midst of developing a new project in the same area - a tourist accommodation management company called `Claus` - with the goal of promoting sustainable tourism, popular culture, and biodiversity in the beautiful Ebro Delta.

<strong> Reach me out to join forces and make positive impact. </strong> <br>
I am down to work on:
- Promoting new businesses based on circularity and sustainability
- Moderating or speaking at events
- Running corporate workshops
- Individual consulting
- Anything else where we could make a great team!
