In the "Topik Khusus" course, my classmates and I were had Internet of Things project. We designed an application that we named SmartCar. The SmartCar application is an application (system) designed to assist car drivers in terms of driving safety on the highway to avoid accidents, avoid criminal acts and make it easier for other users (such as parents or relatives) to monitor the state or condition of the car that is the object of the SmartCar application. The following is an overview of the SmartCar application.

SmartCar have six features. They are location tracking, safe distance, temperature and humidity, vibration detection, notifications-promos, and panic button on the car that is the object then it will capture the data in the form of an image and send it along with all the latest data in each feature to web and mobile app.
