Whisper is an application that I made for fulfill the requirements to complete my undergraduate education. I designed a "rules-based" chatbot application to connect citizen's aspirations that are stored and registered directly with the government. This application then I named "Whisper".

Whisper has 2 modules, there are chatbot application on Telegram, and a website application for the government. People who want to complain about city problems send a complaint message on the Whisper chatbot application. The message is processed using the Python programming language and stored in the MySQL database. The complaint made earlier will be registered with the registered number. This registered number will later be used by the community to monitor whether the complaint has been submitted to the relevant government. The relevant government can view a collection of public complaints through the website application.
