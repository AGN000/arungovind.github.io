Dr. Thomas Pisanic is an Associate Research Professor at the Johns Hopkins <a href="https://inbt.jhu.edu"> Institute for NanoBioTechnology</a> and a BTC Scientist in the <a href="https://breakthroughcancer.org/">Break Through Cancer</a> foundation. Dr. Pisanic serves as an Epidiagnostics Group Investigator, whose overall research goal is the development of novel, cost-effective strategies for the noninvasive detection of human disease and cancer in particular. He has over 20 years of experience working in both the academic and industrial sectors, that has provided with a uniquely broad background for the development of a diverse array of translational clinical diagnostic approaches. Over his career, he has made significant contributions in the fields of cancer epigenetics, diagnostic assay development, microfluidics and nanotechnology, and has co-authored over 30 publications in these various fields. Dr. Pisanicâ€™s current research is primarily focused on characterizing DNA methylation alterations associated with early-stage carcinogenesis and leveraging novel epigenetic analysis strategies for early and companion diagnostic applications for noninvasive detection of lung, colon, and ovarian cancers from various sample types including blood, stool, sputum, and Pap specimens. His long term research goals are aimed at developing and employing innovative multi-analyte molecular analysis techniques with advanced biostatistical and bioinformatic analyses to achieve inexpensive, clinically-practical diagnostics for the early detection of disease. He is also passionate about promoting the creation of new forms of team-based science governance to faciliate strong, interdisciplinary collaborations for developing innovative solutions to challenging problems in biomedicine.


## Short Bio

I received my doctoral degree in Bioengineering in 2006 under the direction of Drs. <a href = "http://newmaeweb.ucsd.edu/groups/sujin/jin.html">Sungho Jin</a> and <a href="https://genomics.eng.ucsd.edu/">Xiaohua Huang</a> at the University of California, San Diego. From 2003 - 2011, I served as head of diagnostic assay development at MagneSensors, a biotech startup located in San Diego. I also hold an M.S. degree (2002) in Bioengineering from UCSD, as well as B.S. and B.A. degrees (1999) in Biomedical and Electrical Engineering, respectively, from Johns Hopkins University.
