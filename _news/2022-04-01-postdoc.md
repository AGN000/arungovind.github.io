I was awarded an NIH Postdoctoral Training Grant (T32) to continue my research at the intersection of cancer systems biology and data science. I am working under Drs. <a href="https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/biochemistry/person/vito-quaranta/">Vito Quaranta</a> and <a href="https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/biochemistry/person/scott-w-hiebert/">Scott Hiebert</a> at Vanderbilt University.
