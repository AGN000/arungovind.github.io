I packaged my network analysis tools as a PYPI package, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/booleabayes/">BooleaBayes</a>. Check out my <a href="https://smgroves.github.io/projects/">Projects</a> page to see all of the code I have developed. This package was written by David Wooten and me, and refactored for packaging by Monica Del Valle.
