Our paper <a href="/publications/#bre-car-fan-wal-2023">Asymptotic linear convergence of Fully-Corrective Generalized Gradient methods</a> has
been accepted for publication on **Mathematical Programming**. We consider minimization problems of the form

$$
\min  F(Ku) + R(u)
$$

prove an eventual linear convergence rate for *Conditional Gradient Methods*
