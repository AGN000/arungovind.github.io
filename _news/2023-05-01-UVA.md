I will be starting as a postdoctoral research associate in the Janes laboratory at UVA in July. I will be working on Project 1 of the U54 Center for Systems Analysis of Stress-adapted Organelles (<a href="https://sasco.virginia.edu/">SASCO</a>). My goal will be to build a computational, physics-based model of the chromosome passenger complex (CPC) that controls chromosome segregation during mitosis. In cancer, it is unknown how the CPC is affected by dysregulated mitotic transcription factors. Using a reaction-diffusion model built in VCell, we will investigate the phase separation behavior of the CPC during mitosis in cancer systems.
