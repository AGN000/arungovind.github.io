I published a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12943-023-01789-9">paper</a> in Molecular Cancer with a group of collaborators at Vanderbilt. I did a WGCNA analysis of melanoma RNA-seq data that provided supporting evidence for the importance of key transcription factors, such as Tfcp2l1, that regulate phenotype after loss of Cxcr2. The Richmond lab and other collaborators did a great job with this work, and I am grateful I was asked to help with the computational analysis for the project!
