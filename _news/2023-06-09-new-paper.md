I recently had two publications published. <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/15/5/1477">One</a> was a first authorship published in Cancers, which showed the relationship between an EMT spectrum and the continuum of transcription factor-driven subtypes in Small Cell Lung Cancer. 

For <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12943-023-01789-9">another</a> published in Molecular Cancer, I did a WGCNA analysis of melanoma RNA-seq data that provided supporting evidence for the importance of key transcription factors, such as Tfcp2l1, that regulate phenotype after loss of Cscr2.
