I spent most of March 2024 in Germany, working with NMMA collaborators at the University of Potsdam, followed by a weeklong workshop in Wismar. The workshop was a great opportunity to meet with the NMMA team and discuss the future of the project. I also had the chance to explore Europe for the first time. I'm looking forward to continuing our work on NMMA, and I'd love to make it back to Germany soon!
