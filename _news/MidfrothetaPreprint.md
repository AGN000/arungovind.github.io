My collaborator Xiaochen Zheng visited our lab today and we took the opportunity to put our new paper on BioRxiv!

We investigated the link between error-related and memory-related brain processes. Our participants performed a difficult task while we recorded their brain activity (<i>with electroencephalography (EEG)</i>). Brain activity in a specific frequency band (<i>4-7 Hz; theta</i>) was increased when an error was made. It is thought that this brain activity reflects a control signal trying to minimize subsequent errors. We hypothesized that this increase in brain activity would be predictive of later memory for errors made. However, our results showed that this was not the case. The error-related increase in brain activity was not predictive to the error memory of our participants.
