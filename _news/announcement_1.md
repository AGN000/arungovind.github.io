I intend to write a longer post, probably in the blog section, about the set-up of this website in due course. For now, the main page is complete and the news items are working. At some point I'll have to work out what distinguishes a longer news item from a blog post. For now, since there is no blog, a news item will have to do!

***

Note that the emjoi in the news item title are produced using the [jemoji] gem. A useful cheat sheet for the emoji codes is available [here][emojicheat]. As the emoji for this item are in the news item title, that is in the YAML front matter for the post, the title needs to be quoted to avoid jekyll throwing an exception for the use of a colon in the front matter.
