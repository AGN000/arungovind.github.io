Our paper titled _Are models biased on text without gender-related language?_ was accepted as a poster at ICLR 2024. In this work, we propose to shift the way bias is measured in language models. Particularly, instead of focusing on well-known gender stereotypes (e.g., gender-occupation, gender-emotion) we propose to diagnose models in a setting that is controled for minimal gender correlations. Our results demonstrate that even when accounting for minimal gender co-occurrence (i.e., sentences have words with faint gender correlation), language models assing an unproportional probability mass to one of the genders in about 60% to 95% of the examples.
