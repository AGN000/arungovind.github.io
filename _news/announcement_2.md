<b>Two PhD Positions for 2024 "Metals in Ore Nanodroplets" Sep14, 2023</b>


We are excited to announce two PhD positions available in the Department of Earth Sciences, University of Hong Kong. These projects aim to study the speciation of metal clusters in water vapor and probe the structure of the water solvation shell around metal clusters using advanced techniques such as FT-mass spectrometry and IR spectroscopy.

As part of this project, the PhD students will measure IRMPD spectra of metal clusters under FT-MS conditions using table top OPO and free-electron laser systems. The combination of both methods will facilitate the measurement of IR spectra of mass-selected ions. In collaboration with quantum chemical tools, this will help to unravel the structure of the ion core and water solvation shell. Current FT-MS IR studies focus on microsolvated polynuclear metal clusters containing Au, Cu, Ag and make use of a custom-built OPO laser system and FEL systems with tunable output in the mid-IR range.
