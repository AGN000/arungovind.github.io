Honored to be awarded the MLP 2019 Young Alumna Award!

In March 2020, I was the recipient of the Maria de Lourdes Pintassilgo (MLP) 2019 award in the category of Young Alumna.This award aims to recognize and reward annually two women who graduated at Técnico, one of whose Master’s thesis has been distinguished for its scientific quality and remarkable academic performance at Instituto Superior Tecnico (IST), University of Lisbon, Portugal.
