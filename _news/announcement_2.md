<strong>Event.</strong> In conversation with Kevis Goodman

***

The STS Working Group invites you to an upcoming proseminar entitled “Pathologies of Motion: Historical Thinking in Medicine, Aesthetics and Poetics,” featuring Professor Kevis Goodman, Professor of English at the University of California, Berkeley.
<div</div>
Professor Goodman will be discussing her forthcoming book, “Pathologies of Motion” (Yale, 2022) as a way to open up larger questions of the ambiguous "and" in "science and literature" – how does one study them in a way that doesn't just involve analogy, or shared themes? What do these questions look like when one is studying these texts at a moment when "science" and "literature" were not, in fact, different disciplines?

The seminar will take place via Zoom on Thursday, November 24 from 2:00 – 4:00pm. Graduate students, advanced undergraduates, and faculty are all welcome to attend. Please let us know of your interest by registering using the link in our bio!
