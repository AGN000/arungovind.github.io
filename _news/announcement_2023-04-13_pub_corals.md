ðŸ“š Need to build large correlation networks but it's taking too much time/memory? Read our new paper on [Large-scale correlation network construction for unraveling the coordination of complex biological systems](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-023-00429-y) in [Nature Computational Science](https://www.nature.com/natcomputsci) together with [Camilo Espinosa](https://nalab.stanford.edu/team/camilo-espinosa-bernal/), [Huda Nassar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/huda-nassar-51ba97205/), and [Nima Aghaeepour](https://nalab.stanford.edu/).
