Adnan Mohammed and Rohan Jain's work on "Sparse Training from Random Initialization: Aligning Lottery Ticket Masks using Weight Symmetry" {% cite mohammed2025sparsetraining %} has been accepted at ICML 2025! 
This work explores the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) and sparse training from a random initialization through the lens of weight and permutation symmetry, proposing a novel approach to improve LTH mask generalization across new random initialization.
