Learnt Terraform today; I created an AWS VPC with an internet gateway, a public subnet, and associated security groups to allow traffic on ports 22, 80, and 443. I also launched an EC2 instance in the public subnet, installed Apache web server, and set up a simple HTML page via user data scripting.
