I'm happy to announce I'll be a jury in [WDL 2022](https://www.worlddataleague.com/).

World Data League (WDL) constitutes a competition that aims to bring together expert ML and AI practitioners to solve real-world problems. This year, the first stage challenges are related to waste production prediction, proposed by [UrbanAI](https://urbanai.fr/), and air pollution prediction for busy streets in Amsterdam, proposed by [UNStudio]().
