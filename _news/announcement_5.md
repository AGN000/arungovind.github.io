I finished the NYU Deep Learning SP21 course which is taught by Prof. Yann Lecun and Alfredo  Canziani.
This course is really up-to-date by presenting state-of-the-art self-supervised learning, contrastive autoencoder, Transformer (self-attention
mechanism), Graph Convolutional/Transformer Network.
