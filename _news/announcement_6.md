In order for our memory to work successfully, we need to guide the retrieval of information and evaluate its authenticity. While the frontal part of the brain (prefrontal cortex) is involved in coordinating this memory retrieval, the posterior regions (posterior parietal cortex) keeps an eye on the accuracy of the retrieved information. However, little is known about the way these two brain regions interact. Brain activity shows specific patterns (neural oscillations) that allow for the communication between brain regions in order to perform tasks like solving a math equation or retrieving a memory. 

 The importance of theta (3-7 Hz) and gamma (>30 Hz) oscillations in memory processes is well established. For instance, theta power is increased when items and their encoding context are successfully retrieved, and gamma oscillations are related to the evaluation of an itemâ€™s overall familiarity level. In the current study, we used transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to entrain frontal and parietal oscillations to the theta (4 Hz) and gamma (50 Hz) frequency, to alter specific memory processes. We used a memory task and measured: memory for words (item memory), memory for the encoding context (source memory), and memory confidence. We applied tACS while participants were remembering this information and explored the electrophysiological correlates with electroencephalography (EEG). Our preliminary EEG findings confirm the proposed roles of endogenous theta and gamma oscillations in memory processes. In addition, our tACS results show that both theta and gamma tACS increased source memory, but only gamma tACS improved memory confidence. Here, we will elaborate on these findings, discuss whether the EEG findings are able to predict tACS effect, and the implications thereof.
