I'm grateful for the opportunity to talk about the calibration of autoregressive question-answering models at [Priberam ML Lunch Seminars 2022](https://www.priberam.com/seminars/on-the-calibration-of-generative-question-answering-models-state-of-the-art-and-challenges/).

__Title__: On the calibration of Generative Question-Answering models: State-of-the-art and Challenges

__Abstract__: Nowadays, generative question-answering models (e.g., UnifiedQA) achieve state-of-the-art performance in various datasets. Despite their remarkable performance, these models still produce wrong answers with high confidence scores. The responsible use of such systems in high-risk applications, like healthcare, requires some guarantees in terms of the correlation of the model scores and the outputâ€™s correctness. One potential approach toward these guarantees is calibration. Despite the vast research on calibration for K-ary classification in machine learning, calibration for textual-based systems imposes additional challenges that range from a combinatorial output space to the many definitions of correctness. In this talk, we will discuss the challenges towards the calibration of generative question-answering systems, as well as the current state-of-the-art approaches to address it.
