We just published [our study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356303248_Modeling_outdoor_thermal_comfort_along_cycling_routes_at_varying_levels_of_physical_accuracy_to_predict_bike_ridership_in_Cambridge_MA) on the relationship between outdoor thermal comfort and bike ridership in Cambridge, MA, led by [Elizabeth Young](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethlynyoung). Great collaboration between Cornell, MIT, and TU Munich.
