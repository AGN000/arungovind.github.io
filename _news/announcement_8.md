As a member of the Deep Learning Sessions Portugal (DLSPT), I have hosted a meetup on MLOps with the guest Jorge Pessoa. Beyond discussing the challenges to the deployment of ML, Jorge provides practical advices that range from unit-like testing to several toolsets that can be used to help deploy ML solutions.
