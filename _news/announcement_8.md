I have been invited to give a talk at BoF on Distributed Memory Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Library at the [Cray User Group (CUG)](https://cug.org/) annual meeting 2021 about our work on [HPC-in-the-Cloud](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.00656.pdf). You can find my slides [on their website](http://www.fft.report/CUG21.html).
