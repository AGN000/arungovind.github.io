As a member of the Deep Learning Sessions Portugal (DLSPT), I have hosted a meetup on the use of Deep Learning (DL) for autonomous driving. We hosted Ana Ferreira & Christian Perone from [Woven Planet (level 5)](https://level-5.global/). This is a very complex and safety-critical task that requires careful design and planning. In this talk, Ana and Christian will describe how Deep Learning is shaping decision-making and motion planning in autonomous vehicle systems.
