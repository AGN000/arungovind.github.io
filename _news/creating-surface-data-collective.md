After taking some personal time, I've started my next adventure.  I'm
calling this Surface Data Collective.  In this effort, I'm going to apply
all my knowledge around Natural Language Processing focused datasets and
structure it as an open cooperative where everyone participating has a say
in the governance and ownership of the data being created.
