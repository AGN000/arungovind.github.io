I am glad to give two talks this week, one at the [SÃ©minaire Parisien de Statistique](https://sites.google.com/site/semstats/ann%C3%A9e-2022-2023/s%C3%A9ance-du-14-novembre-2022) and another at [ML4 Life SCience](https://ml4lifesciences.sciencesconf.org/) in Montpellier, both based on this [material about recent advances in the Poisson lognormal model](assets/talks/talks_11-22.html) :sparkles:
