I'm leased to announce in August I'll start as USDA NIFA PostDoc Fellowship in the [Plant Computational Genomics Lab](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=uconn+plant+computation+genomics+lab&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) with Dr. Jill Wegrzyn. Looing forward to some field work in some beautiful East Coast forests!
