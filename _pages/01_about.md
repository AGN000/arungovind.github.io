I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Brain and Spine Institute](https://icm-institute.org), Sorbonne University, Paris, France. My current research focusses on developing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) biomarkers of Parkinson's disease in the brain and spinal cord.

I completed my PhD in MRI Physics (2019) at the [Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-physics-biomedical-engineering/), University College London, UK. During my PhD, I developed and optimised methods for MRI Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) in the healthy brain and vascular malformations.

Previously, I completed both my MSc of Bioengineering (2014) and BSc of Information Engineering (2012) at the [Department of Information Engineering](https://www.dei.unipd.it/en/), University of Padua, Italy.
