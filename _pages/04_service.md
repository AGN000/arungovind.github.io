### Community service
**Non-executive co-director of [Movement for Hope](http://www.movementforhope.org/)**

From 2016 to 2018 I was executive co-director of Movement for Hope, a non-profit social enterprise based in London, UK working in the field of neurological conditions. Since moving to France in the end of 2018, I moved to the role of non-executive co-director.

Movement for Hope's projects focus on three social targets: research support, adaptive equipment purchases and awareness-education. 

To fund Movement for Hope's projects, I helped acquire grants and sponsorships from:
* Imanova Ltd, 2016
* RSL Steeper, 2016
* Smartbox, 2016
* UK Physiological Society, 2016
* UCL Volunteering, 2016

Two public engagement events that I co-organised, namely Rewired 2017 and Rewired 2018, were reviewed by The Lancet Neurology:
