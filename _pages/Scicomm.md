<font size="+2">World Science Festival</font>

The [World Science Festival](https://www.worldsciencefestival.com/) was highly influential in my decision to return to school. I was lucky enough to volunteer for the WSF on several occasions before the pandemic. As a Science Ambassador for the WSF, I would occasionally spend weekends teaching physics to students of all ages through demonstrations and presentations in the *City of Science* program. If the program returns, I highly suggest volunteering as much as your schedule allows. Sign up at [World Science Festival](https://www.worldsciencefestival.com/).

<font size="+2">Physics Office Hours (PhysicsOH)</font>

In the early stages of the pandemic, I noticed a need among my students. Professors were overwhelmed with the transition to online learning, and students needed more assistance. Physics Office Hours started as a Reddit post, where I offered free help to undergraduate students struggling with first-year physics. After a few days, the students stopped showing, and a viewer base dedicated to learning physics began to grow. PhyscsOH became a community of assistance and development for anyone and everyone interested in physics. I was incredibly lucky to have the time (for two years) to grow the community and meet many amazing people, all interested in learning. Through those two years, I created a significant amount of content that continues to benefit those eager to learn. Below you'll find all the necessary links. Though PhysicsOH is suspended while I finish my degree, feel free to drop me a line if you have any questions!

Twitch was the main platform, as the program was always held live: [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/physicsoh)

Many of the VODs were edited and uploaded onto YouTube. Check under the "Playlists" tab to see videos covering specific topics: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoJP3W_S2Vt6jhrSIv0ScMg)

Many of the notes (mostly hand-written but some LaTeX) I used are still available on the dedicated Google Drive: [Notes!](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/194SQQsZHGHAMSeG-EDLO0pdiG9wBySeQ?usp=sharing)

The Discord remains to be a place where anyone can come and get expert answers and support from many physicists working in many fields: [Discord](https://discord.gg/Enc9E7k)
