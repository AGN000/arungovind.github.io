## If you are planning to apply for a PhD (and work with me)

* First and foremost, the admission process is through [Cornell CIS](https://cis.cornell.edu/) and not through me personally. So please don't send a general email with your CV asking about the chances of admission. 
  * The information about the admission process at Cornell CIS can be found [here](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/phd/admissions). 

* I'm interested in students with background and strong research interest in High-Performance Computing and Parallel Programming and Systems research; interest in Computatational Sciences (e.g., Computational Biology) is a plus.

* Be aware that I ignore any email that doesn't clearly indicate a genuine interest in my work. 

<!-- * It is fine if you don't have a strong background and research experience in High-Performance Computing and Parallel Programming, but then you must make a special effort to show me why you are interested in my work and why you think you are a good fit for my research. If you are interested in Deep Learning, Data Science, and the like (i.e., not Parallel Programming and Systems) without clearly explaining why this is of interest to me and my research, I will ignore your email.
 -->
* To express interest in my work, you must show that you:
  * have an idea of what I do;
  * have a background that at least intrigues me;
  * that my work is of interest to you; and
  * include the sentence "mantua me genuit" somewhere random in the email.
