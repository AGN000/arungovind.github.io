I am a Data Scientist at [Sigmoid Analytics](https://sigmoid.com) where I work on Big Data and clustering techniques to analyze and develop insights on Consumer Packaged Goods Industries' data. My research interests span Generative Models, Computer Vision and Energy Materials.

Previously, I was a Research Intern at [Coulomb.ai](https://coulomb.ai) where I worked on designing Machine Learning algorithms and evaluation set-ups for determining State of Health and life of Li-ion Batteries. I was fortunate to work on creating materials database and geometric optimization of s and p-block elements using DFT as a Research Intern under Prof. Chandra Sekhar Tiwary of IIT Kharagpur.

I earned my B. Tech. in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. I was part of different laboratories which had helped me to gain expertise in Materials Engineering domain. I enjoy playing cricket and guitar.
