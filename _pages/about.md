I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Center for Imaging Science](http://cis.jhu.edu/) at Johns Hopkins University, working with Professors [Carey E. Priebe](http://www.ams.jhu.edu/~priebe/) and [Joshua T. Vogelstein](https://jovo.me/). Previously, I completed my PhD in the [Department of Statistics](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats) at the University of Michigan, advised by [Professor Liza Levina](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~elevina/).

My research interests include statistical network analysis, machine learning, high dimensional data analysis, and applications to neuroimaging.

I received a B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics and a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from the [Mexico Autonomous Institute of Technology (ITAM)](www.itam.mx).
