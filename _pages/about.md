Hi There! Welcome!  I'm a former Staff Software Engineer and Manager (via
Google Translate). I'm now a machine learning engineer for startups.  I'm
working on fine-tuning LLMs for various use cases with supervised fine tuning
and RLHF tuning.  I also do my best to share my management experience from
Translate with new teams.  Casually I like to ski, I'm trying to learn how to
use synthesizers, and make my own granola and beer.  If you visit Japan, say
hi.
