I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](http://ics.uci.edu) at the [University of California, Irvine](http://uci.edu). I study machine learning under [Professor Padhraic Smyth](http://ics.uci.edu/~smyth/). My research interests can broadly be described as probabilistic modeling, Bayesian machine learning, and predictive uncertainty. 

Prior to joining UCI, I completed my undergraduate degree in mathematics (*summa cum laude*, 2019) in the [Schreyer Honors College](http://shc.psu.edu) at the [Pennsylvania State University](http://psu.edu).
