I am a second-year PhD student at the University of Copenhagen supervised by Professor Isabelle Augenstein. Before joining the [CopeNLU](https://www.copenlu.com/){:target="\_blank"} group I've completed the MSc in Statistics at the Humboldt University of Berlin. Before that, I've obtained a Bachelor of Science in Economics also at the Humboldt University of Berlin. I'm a member of [Rycolab](https://rycolab.io/){:target="\_blank"} at ETH ZÃ¼rich co-supervised by Ryan Cotterell.

My PhD work focuses on gender bias detection in cross-lingual setups and interpretability. My primary research interests are bias and fairness in NLP, interpretability, and statistical methods.

Besides, prior to starting my PhD I have worked as a data science consultant for [Deloitte Analytics Institute](https://www2.deloitte.com/de/de.html){:target="\_blank"}.
