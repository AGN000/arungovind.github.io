Hello and welcome to the `Cached Studios Blog`.  
As a software engineer, I often find myself scouring the web for tips, solutions to issues, new technologies, etc. I owe a lot of what I know thanks to bloggers who took the time to post. I've always stopped myself from blogging because I never considered that I could have anything worth sharing. Hopefully there is something in here that you can find useful, or just entertaining.
