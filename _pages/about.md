* I am a PhD student in [Crypto Group](https://www.cs.au.dk/~orlandi/cryptogroup/) at [Aarhus University, Denmark](https://international.au.dk/). I am supervised by [Claudio Orlandi](https://cs.au.dk/~orlandi/). I am interested in Zero-Knowlege Proof Systems and Secure Multiparty Computation. 
* In 2020, I received an MTech in Computer Science from Indian Institue of Science ([IISc](https://iisc.ac.in/)), Bangalore. I was a part of [CrIS](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~cris/) lab at IISc and worked with [Arpita Patra](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arpita/) towards my Master's Thesis titled [''A Robust PPML Framework for Three Servers''](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~cris/resources/thesis/Mahak_thesis).
