I am a fourth year PhD student at the University of British Columbia (UBC). I work with a microbiologist, [<u>Dr. REW Hancock</u>](http://cmdr.ubc.ca/bobh/), and a statistician, [<u>Dr. G Cohen-Freue</u>](https://gcohenfr.github.io/), which has offered me the perfect learning environment given my research interests. I am interested in using various statistical learning techniques to biological problems, particularly those involving an over-activated immune system. My PhD research centers on biomarker discovery in [<u>sepsis</u>](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2819%2932989-7), with the goal of creating translatable tools for prognosis.

Beyond research, I do other nerdy things, like read books and watch random math videos; I also do less-nerdy things, like bike, snowboard, swim, drink cool alcoholic drinks, and spend excessive amounts of time on Netflix.
