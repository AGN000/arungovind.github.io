I am a Research Scientist in the Tetherless World Constellation at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, where I research and apply Semantic Web technologies in multidisciplinary domains for supporting more flexible, more efficient, and improved solutions in comparison with traditional approaches.

My research interests include data integration, knowledge representation, domain-specific reasoning, and explainable artificial intelligence. I have over 10 years of experience working with Semantic Web technologies and I hold a Doctor of Science degree (D.Sc.) in Applied Informatics from Universidade de Fortaleza, Brazil.

<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
