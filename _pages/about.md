I am an interdiscplinary ecosystem scientist researching forest succession after disturbances like fire and harvest. I specialize in remote-sensing techniques to quantify forest canopy structure using lidar (light detection and ranging), DAP (digital aerial photogrammetry) and various satellite monitoring tehcnologies. In my PhD, I aim to provide forest managers with accessible and accurate tools to characterize post-disturbance forest composition in hazardous and remote locations.  

I am enthusiatic about science communication and am always looking for ways to engage the population. Please reach out if you are interested in a talk or research demonstration on drones, satellites, or forest science. I am also experienced in mixed linear modeling and machine learning and am always happy for #StatsChatz.
