Greetings!

My name is Zheyuan Zhang(张喆元 in chinese). You can call me Brian which is my English name chosen by myself. I am an undergraduate student at [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/). View my latest CV [here](assets/cv.pdf).

My research interests lie in the intersection of computer science, robotics, psychology and neuroscience. I think neuroscience gives an overview of structure and the connectivity of the brain. Psychology gives interpretation of our mind and behaviour which generates actions. Computer science correlates above with mathematics and other sciences to build a machine which simulates brain. Finally, robotics assembles everything with mechanical and electrical engineering into an intelligent human-like machine with dexterous body. This also applies to animal-like robots. I am particularly interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning because I like exploring how the brain works and how we understand the world. My goal is to build robots with high-level intelligence to have similar thinking processes like humans and other animals, including perception, learning, decision-making and emotions.

I have many hobbies. In my spare time, I enjoy playing computer games. I love watching TV-series and movies. I went to gym 3-5 times a week lifting weights to train my physique. Also, I am an audiophile who likes Hi-Fi devices including headphones, speakers, DACs, amplifiers.
