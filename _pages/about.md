I am a PhD candidate at <a href="https://telfer.uottawa.ca/en/">Telfer School of Management</a>, University of Ottawa, Canada. I work under the supervision of Dr. Onur Ozturk and Dr. Jonathan Patrick, specializing in Health Systems. Also, I completed my MSc and BSc in [Industrial Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_engineering) from Azad University, Tehran, Iran.

I am interested in the operational challenges associated with healthcare and supply chain management problems. I use Advanced Analytics and Machine Learning to improve performance metrics (e.g., costs, resource utilization, and workload equity) for multi-stakeholder and large-sized problems. My expertise mostly includes the design of meta-heuristic, heuristic, Benders decomposition, column generation and approximate dynamic programming algorithms.

Outside of academia, I try to use what I learned through my research and apply it to real-world opportunities to have a more robust and well-rounded education. In addition, I quite often do work out and would like cycling and kayaking during summers.
