The Sustainable Urban Systems Lab, led by [Dr. Patrick Kastner](people/) at Georgia Tech's School of Architecture, focuses on developing innovative tools and methodologies for urban regeneration. Our mission is to redefine urban decision-making by creating surrogate models that provide real-time feedback on environmental performance and sustainability metrics.

Talk to us or join our lab when you are interested in these topics or our work. Students at Georgia Tech and beyond, please find our courses, theses, and jobs.
