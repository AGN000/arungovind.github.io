Hi there! I'm Chinmaya Kausik, a first-year mathematics Ph.D. student at UMich, with a background in geometry, topology and dynamics. A lot of my undergraduate work is in computer-assisted topology and geometry. I have nascent interests in statistical and reinforcement learning, especially offline RL and causality. 

Other things I'm eager to learn more about: geometric and topological insights for data analysis and machine learning (for example, non-positive curvature representation learning), algorithmic fairness.

These days, I increasingly care about mathematical problems motivated by tangible, real-world questions. I also care about increasing accessibility to higher mathematics, and this is part of why I co-founded and co-organize [Monsoon Math Camp](https://www.monsoonmath.org) - an online math camp for promising high school students introducing them to advanced undergraduate and graduate-level math. You should check it out! 

To provide a glimpse into graduate student life and also create a greater sense of accountability for myself, I will attempt to maintain a periodic log of my academic/professional progress on this website. Check out my other [projects](projects.md) and reading suggestions!
