I have enthusiasm for applying mathematics to practical problems in different disciplines. My graduate work mainly focuses on developing theoretical results in optimal transport theory for problems in measure concentration, network information theory, and machine learning theory. Besides my theoretical background, I am capable of implementing my ideas using programming languages like Python, Matlab, etc.
