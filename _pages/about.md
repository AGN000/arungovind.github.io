Welcome to my website! 

I am a PhD student in Social and Political Science at the UC3M under the supervision of [Pedro Riera](https://pedro-riera.com/). During the Spring of 2024, I was a visiting researcher at the [EUI](https://www.eui.eu/en/home). I am also part of the POLGEO research group led by Pedro Riera (PI).

I am interested in political behavior and comparative politics using quantitative methods. In my PhD research, I study the interplay of context and socialization dynamics. Specifically, I look at how changes in the environment influence a) socialization in the community, b) socialization in the family, and c) political socialization. In different papers, I see how touristification affects community participation, how unexpected election outcomes influence parents´ efforts to transmit their identity traits to their children, and how economic hardship shapes the development of partisan identification. 

Before starting my PhD, I earned an MS in Economics from the Universitat de Barcelona and a BS in Economics from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.
