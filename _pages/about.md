Hello! I am an undergraduate student at <a href="http://www.mein.nagoya-u.ac.jp/en/index.html">Intelligent Robotics and Bio-Mechatronics Lab</a> at Nagoya University, Japan. I am interested at the intersection of robotics and natural language processing, especially how we can build intelligent robots that will need least of human supervision and operate via language instructions.  
My current research includes exploration of tactile sensors and their employment in dexterous in-hand manipulations and haptic interfaces.  
Outside my research work, I build interesting stuff and post about my experience on my <a href="https://vocdex.github.io/blog/">blog</a>.   
The best way to reach me is by email at <a href="mailto:nazirjonovsh2000@gmail.com">nazirjonovsh2000@gmail.com</a>.
