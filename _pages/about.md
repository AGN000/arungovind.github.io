Hi! I'm Vishakha Malhotra, a Data Scientist and Dentist based in San Francisco, CA. With a background in Biostatistics, and Healthcare, I bring a unique blend of skills to the world of Data Science.

ðŸš€ Currently, I'm diving deep into Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing at UC San Francisco, where I analyze patient data to improve treatment outcomes.

ðŸ’¡ I love exploring the intersection of healthcare and data, whether it's developing machine learning models for dental radiographs or conducting data analysis for healthcare research!

ðŸŽ“ I hold a Masters in Data Science from UC San Francisco and a Bachelor of Dental Surgery from Mahatma Gandhi University of Medical Sciences & Technology, Jaipur, India.
