Hi, call me Mew for short. My job title is _Data scientist_. I analyze data and solve machine learning (ML) problems for a living.

I learned about [Concept drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_drift) with ML in grad school, but it's not that popular so I picked up [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) on my first job, and have been working on it ever since.

I earned my master's degree in Information Science in 2018 from Osaka University, and bachelor's in Computer Engineering in 2015 from Chulalongkorn University.
