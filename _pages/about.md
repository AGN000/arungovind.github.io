Hi there! I'm Chinmaya Kausik, a first-year mathematics Ph.D. student at UMich, with a background in geometry, topology and dynamics. A lot of my undergraduate work is in computer-assisted topology and geometry. I have nascent interests in statistical and reinforcement learning, especially offline RL and causality. 

Check out my [projects](projects) (along with post-mortems) and [interests](more)!

**What do I care about, broadly?** 
1. Increasingly care about mathematical problems motivated by tangible, real-world questions. This is behind the new interests above. 
2. Increasing accessibility to higher mathematics and creating strong communities that accelerate the growth of students. This is part of why I co-founded and co-organize [Monsoon Math Camp](https://www.monsoonmath.org) - an online math camp for promising high school students introducing them to advanced undergraduate and graduate-level math. You should check it out! I have also been involved in building and expanding other mathematical communities, like platforms for the PolyMath REU, DRP programs and the undergraduate math organization at IISc, etc.
3. What all is broken in academic communities? How can I contribute to fixing it? In one example, creating and participating in communities where ideas cross-pollinate more naturally and people pull each other up. To concretely illustrate the need for that, there is apparently a strong potential for using insights from geometric group theory and coarse geometry in representation learning and dimensionality reduction. I am fleshing out many possibilities right now - please reach out to me if your idea fits this broad umbrella.  

**What am I doing lately?**
1. Learning reinforcement learning theory and offline RL.
2. Taking graduate electives in math - especially excited about Math 626 (topics course in probability covering ergodic theory, Markov chains and mixing times) and Math 797 (the coarse geometry of Teichmuller space).
3. Learning about Rishi Sonthalia's TreeRep algorithm for efficiently learning metrics on trees (hyperbolic representation learning).
4. To provide a glimpse into graduate student life and also create a greater sense of accountability for myself, attempting to maintain a [periodic log](log) of my academic/professional progress on this website. 
5. Working on finishing up the GUI for my algorithm for generalized Seifert matrices.
6. Gearing up for Monsoon Math 2022!

**What do I want to learn about in the future?**
1. Causality and its interaction with sequential decision making and RL.
2. Natural Language Processing.
3. Using insights from machine learning for biology. In a specific example, how to learning a hierarchical or causal structure from genomics data.
4. Geometric and topological insights for data analysis and machine learning (for example, non-positive curvature representation learning).
5. Algorithmic fairness.

**Collaborators and mentors**
This list is highly incomplete and unordered, but I have greatly benefitted from interacting with and learning from the following amazing people: Prof. Alex Wright, Prof. Siddhartha Gadgil, Prof. Subhojoy Gupta, Prof. Stefan Friedl, Jos&eacute Pedro Quintanilha, Miraya Poddar-Agrawal, Julian D'Costa, Abishek Rajan.
