I am a second-year PhD student at MIT, advised by Professor [Vivishek Sudhir](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j4NKNWQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). My research interest is `quantum precision measurements` to explore the gap between quantum physics and gravity. Specifically, we use light to measure and control macroscoptic mechanical oscillators, and aim to realize tangible quantum test masses. These efforts will pave the way for future quantum applications such as quantum sensing and quantum metrology.

Before coming to MIT, I received B.S. and M.S. degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Tokyo Institute of Technology and the University of Tokyo, respectively. Then, I completed my military duty at KAIST as a research associate, where I studied frequency combs, time/frequency standards, and precision measurements.
