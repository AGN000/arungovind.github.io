Hi! I'm Alessandro and I'm a PhD candidate at EPFL in the [Physics of Complex Systems Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/pcsl/) and in the [Laboratory for Signal Processing](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lts4/).

The goal of my research is to advance the science of modern machine learning algorithms. I aim to understand why and how artificial neural networks work and how to improve them further. I focus primarily on generalization properties, the role of invariants, and scaling theories, often building on insights from statistical physics.

I enjoy working both studying analytical models and performing numerical experiments.
