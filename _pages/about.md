I am an atmospheric chemist with a background in meteorology. In my recently obtained PhD, I explored the global and localised impacts of the chemistry of a group of important reservoirs of reactive nitrogen, alkyl nitrates, on the composition of the Earthâ€™s troposphere. I worked with a global 3D chemistry-climate model UM-UKCA, implementing new alkyl nitrate chemistry and oceanic and biomass burning emissions and validating the model against aircraft observations from the Atmospheric Tomography mission. As a postdoc, I investigate the chemical composition of hydrogen dominated gas giant exoplanets, with a focus on high altitudes, where photodissociation and photoionisation determine the atmospheric composition of such exoplanets.
