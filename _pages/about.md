I'm a Machine Learning Researcher at [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/). My research interests are in Natural Language Understanding, Structured data prediction, and Retrieval Augmented Generation with LLMs. 

Previously, I was an Applied science intern at [Amazon Alexa AI - NLU](https://www.amazon.science/tag/alexa) and an Analyst at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/). I was supervised by [Prof. Andrew McCallum](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/) during my grad school at UMass NLP [https://nlp.cs.umass.edu/]. I also completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science at [Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad](https://iith.ac.in/) where I worked on Bayesian Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing with [Prof. Srijith P.K.](https://sites.google.com/site/pksrijith/home).
