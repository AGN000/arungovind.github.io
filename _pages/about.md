## About me

My research is at the intersection between machine learning and robust control, where I am currently working learning probabilistic robust controllers (a.k.a. policies).
I am also activly working on Bayesian optimization in the context of reinforcment learning.

The first part of my PhD took place the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de) where I was a member of the [Intelligent Control Systems Group](https://ics.is.mpg.de/).
For the second part I was given the opportunity to move to Aachen together with my advisor [Prof. Sebastian Trimpe](https://www.dsme.rwth-aachen.de/cms/DSME/Das-Institut/Team-CMS-Artikel-/~jlolt/Prof-Sebastian-Trimpe). We are now building up the new Institute for Data Science in Mechanical Engineering.
I am an associated student of the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems [IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/) and my PhD is supported by [IAV](https://www.iav.com).

Before joining the Max-Planck Institute for my master thesis and later my PhD in 2018 I studied **Computer Science** at the University of LÃ¼beck. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in **Electrical Engineering** at the BHT Berlin in 2013. In between the two degrees I worked as **Software Engineer** before returning to academia.
