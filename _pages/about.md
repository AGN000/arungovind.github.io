I am Yushu Shi.

I graduated from the School of Mathematics at Nankai University in June 2012 and later came to the Medical College of Wisconsin to pursue my Ph.D. in Biostatistics. Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center. 

My research has been focusing on nonparametric Bayesian models, unsupervised clustering, survival analysis and microbiome related statistical methods.
