Ashkan got his master degree in industrial engineering in 2018, and after that, did another master's in MBA. 
He started his adventure as a double degree Ph.D student in mid-2019 with the close collaboration of KU Leuven's STADIUS/ESAT lab and the Biomedical data science research group of Hasselt University in Belgium.
He is currently working on federated learning frameworks to apply this framework in health and big data using real-world data.
He believes in FAIR data. As "Accessibility" is one of these FAIR data principles, He aims to launch the infrastructures and frameworks that support and learns from other data sources without sacrificing the privacy of real-world data and enabling collaborative learning. He believes we have already passed the centralized data silos era for big data research, and we should come up with ideas to infer how to learn from data, of course, by considering all the ethical and legal challenges.
His other research interests are Machine Learning, Collaborative Learning, Decentralization, and MLOps, with a keen interest in containerization and Dashboard Design.
