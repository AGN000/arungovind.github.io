Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. I am not sure whether the changes I make here will be reflected there or not. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Abhishek Ranjan Singh, an electrical engineer by training, has etched a significant mark in the domains of robotics and machine learning. With a solid academic foundation from reputed institutions like North Carolina State University, USA, and Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology, India, Abhishek embarked on an exciting journey in the world of technology and innovation.

After earning his Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering from NIT-B, India, with an impressive GPA of 3.8/4.0, Abhishek pursued further studies in the USA. He completed his Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from North Carolina State University with a perfect GPA of 4.0/4.0, showcasing his dedication and prowess in the subject.

During his tenure as a Graduate Research Assistant at EcoPRT Lab, NCSU, he made notable contributions to the realm of autonomous driving. Abhishek's collaboration with the psychology department led to the design of an innovative lighting system for vehicles, a project that aimed to gauge people's reactions to autonomous vehicles. This pioneering work, underpinned by Raspberry-Pi-controlled LEDs and C++ programming, speaks volumes about his knack for interdisciplinary innovation.

Abhishek's professional journey saw him wearing multiple hats. As a Robotics Software Engineer at Rizse in Austin, Texas, he enhanced the path planning capabilities of UAVs with real-time obstacle avoidance solutions. His tenure at Apple, one of the world's tech giants, had him diving deep into machine learning. Abhishek developed cutting-edge object detection algorithms and efficiently managed 3D Lidar streams, fusing data from multiple streams to create a coherent whole.

His freelance endeavors as a Robotics Software Engineer with Insite-3D in Austin further demonstrate his expertise, where he successfully implemented a 3D-SLAM algorithm for an autonomous drone.

Beyond his professional roles, Abhishek's passion for innovation led to his thesis project titled "PointPillars++ for Object Detection." By building on existing technologies like PointPillars & PointNet++, he designed a groundbreaking object detection algorithm that pushed the boundaries of 3-D object detection metrics.

Abhishek's technical acumen spans a wide range of tools and languages, from C++ and Python to specialized libraries like ROS/ROS2 and Tensorflow. His publication in the Imperial International Journal of Eco-friendly Technologies further underscores his dedication to contributing to the global knowledge pool.

Active on platforms like LinkedIn and GitHub, Abhishek Ranjan Singh's journey is a testament to the blend of academic rigor, technical prowess, and a drive to innovate in the ever-evolving fields of robotics and machine learning.
