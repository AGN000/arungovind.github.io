I am a final-year graduate student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.ucsd.edu/) at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), being advised by [Young-Han Kim](https://web.eng.ucsd.edu/~yhk/) and [Sanjoy Dasgupta](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/).
My graduate study was generously supported by the [Kwanjeong scholarship](http://www.ikef.or.kr/).

[//]: I am on the job market this academic year, looking for a postdoctoral position starting in Summer 2022.

I received my B.S. in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.snu.ac.kr/en) and B.S. in [Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.snu.ac.kr/) (with minor in [Physics](https://physics.snu.ac.kr/en)) with the highest distinction from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr) in 2015.

My research interests lie at the intersection of <b>information theory</b> and <b>machine learning</b>.
In particular, I am interested in developing fast data-processing algorithms with provable guarantees, using ideas and insights from information theory.
Research keywords include:
- low-dimensional embedding, representation learning;
- nonparameteric methods, nearest-neighbor-based algorithms;
- universal information processing.
