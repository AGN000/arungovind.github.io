I have enthusiasm for appling mathematics to practical problems in different disciplines. My graduate work mainly focuses on developing theoratical tools in optimal transport for problems in network information theory and machine learning. Besides my theoretical background, I am capable of implementing my ideas using programing languages like Python, Matlab, Julia.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit # `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too.
