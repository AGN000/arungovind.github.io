I am a graduate student at Dependable systems lab at University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. I work under [Prof Karthik Pattabiraman](http://blogs.ubc.ca/karthik/).

My research interests include: Formal methods; End-to-end verification of systems; Programming languages; Cyber physical systems; Security.

I love playing guitar. It's been more than a decade since I picked up this instrument and since then I have never looked back. I keep putting short videos now and then. I recently started painting (Beware!).
