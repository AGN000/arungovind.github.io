Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate with the [Artificial Intelligence and its Applications Institute](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/aiai) at the University of Edinburgh. I am currently a member of the [Technology Usability Lab in Privacy and Security (TULIPS)](https://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/tulips/) and the Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (CHAI) Lab. My research revolves around the critical area of organizational phishing management, where I utilize the advancements of AI and NLP to develop intelligent tools for strengthening defenses against cyber threats. By integrating human-computer interaction (HCI) principles, I strive to create user-oriented solutions that empower organizations to safeguard against phishing attacks more effectively. Together, we can fortify the digital landscape and foster a safer environment for businesses and individuals alike.
