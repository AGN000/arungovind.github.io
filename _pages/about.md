Many body problems in biology at the single-molecule level

We are a new, interdisciplinary lab in the Department of Physics at UIUC. We are interested in physical principles underlying molecular interactions and functions inside the cell. Currently, we study spatio-temporal dynamics of RNA polymerases during transcription and RNA degradosome in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. 

We are hiring! We are looking for highly energetic and motivated graduate students and postdocs with backgrounds in physics, chemistry, and biology. Please contact Sangjin via email.
