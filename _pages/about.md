As a driven and enthusiastic machine learning researcher, I have dedicated the past three years to unlocking the immense potential of artificial intelligence across diverse industries. My expertise lies in the research and development of cutting-edge technologies such as object detection, action recognition, object tracking, and statistical machine learning modeling. During my time at [Thelios AI](https://www.thelios.ai/), I collaborated with [Dr. Sunil Kulkarni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunilkul) (CTO) on computer vision prototype. 

I am a Master's student in Computer Science at [Stuttgart University](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/), Germany. I graduated from [Gujarat Technological University](https://www.gtu.ac.in/) with degree in Computer Engineering, adviced by [Prof. Dr. Mita Paunwala](https://ckpcet.ac.in/departments/ecc/staff-profile/460). I had the opportunity to work on exciting research under [Prof. Dr. Arnav Bhavsar](https://iitmandi.irins.org/profile/113329) at IIT Mandi on Microscopy Image Classification.
