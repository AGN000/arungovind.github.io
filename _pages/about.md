I am a **Researcher** in the Cognitive Computing Lab at [Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com/) working with [Dr. Ping Li](http://research.baidu.com/People/index-view?id=111) on generative modeling and its practical applications (e.g., Information Retrieval and AI Security). Previously, I was at [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu/)/[Sanghani Center for Artificial Intelligence & Data Analytics](https://sanghani.cs.vt.edu/) ([Prof. Chandan K. Reddy](https://people.cs.vt.edu/reddy)) &#10229; [Criteo AI Lab](https://ailab.criteo.com/) ([Dr. Sathiya Keerthi Selvaraj](http://www.keerthis.com/) and Dr. Fengjiao Wang)  &#10229; [UMCP](https://www.cs.umd.edu/)/[NASA Goddard Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/goddard). More about me **[HERE](/bio)** and my professional/academic services **[HERE](/bio#services)**.

<!-- I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University](cs.vt.edu), and MS in Computer Science from [University of Maryland, College Park](cs.umd.edu). -->

<h5><a href="/bio" style="color:black;">{{"Research Interests"}}</a></h5>
My research seeks answers to the following question: *Are existing ML methods easier-to-use and reliable for practical uses*? I am interested in developing computational frameworks that enable existing complex/deep models to be more suitable for practical uses. I focus on improving the following aspects of existing models: (i) **training**, (i) **inference**, (iii) **realistic assumptions**, and (iv) **security understanding**. Most of my ML/AI solutions center around generative-based approaches that have low computational complexity and require less human effort. More about my research interests **[HERE](/bio#research_interests)**.
