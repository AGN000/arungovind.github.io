## About Me

Hello world! I'm Alex, a data scientist based in London.  

I currently work as a **Senior Data Scientist at Intuit**, focusing on **text matching, LLM-related tasks, and A/B testing**. My journey started as a **data analyst**, but I quickly transitioned into **data science**, drawn by its deeper connection to my background. You can find my detailed career path in my <a href='/cv'>CV</a>

As an **individual contributor**, I:  
- Developed **Compliance and credit scoring models**  
- Deployed **BERT** to production for customer support optimization  
- Worked on **Time series forecasting** and **uplift modeling** projects

Later, I took on a **Team Lead** role, managing data scientists and hiring specialists. I led teams working on:  
- **Promotion Optimization** – forecasting hundreds of thousands of time series daily to optimize revenue and market share  
- **Pricing Models** – predicting prices for millions of goods, balancing revenue, stock levels, cannibalization effects, and novelty constraints  

After relocating to **Israel**, I joined **Intuit** as an **IC**, where I:  
- Led **data science projects** for a **data aggregation platform**, optimizing daily ingestion from thousands of sources  
- **Reduced error rates by >30%**  
- Founded and led **the Israeli Data Science Guild** (70+ members) until relocating to London  

## Why This Portfolio?

I'm a **full-time data scientist**, a **proud father**, a **husband**, and a **dog owner**. Unfortunately, I don’t have much time to contribute to **open-source projects** or **data science competitions**.  

However, after **8+ years in the field**, I’ve gathered **a lot of knowledge and experience worth sharing**—even if I don’t have much open-source code to show for it.  

This portfolio is my way of giving back. I’ll be sharing:  
- **Hints & tips** I wish I had earlier  
- **Code snippets** for tricky problems  
- **Guides & checklists** for data science workflows  

If you find something useful here, **feel free to reach out**—I’d love to connect!
