I studied my Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and Statistics at Hong Kong Baptist University. After then, I obtained my master's degree in Statistics with Data Science from the University of Edinburgh. After graduation, I worked as a research assistant in <a href='https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/data-science-unit'>Data Science Unit</a> in the School of Informatics of the University of Edinburgh.
