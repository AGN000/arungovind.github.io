I am a first-generation senior undergraduate studying Data Science at the [Halƒ±cƒ±oƒülu Data Science Institute](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/) at UC San Diego. My research interests are **long-range graph neural networks**, **deep learning-based structured signal recovery**, and **(inverse) reinforcement learning for robotics**.

## summary 
During my time at UCSD, I was the recipient of two competitive scholarships offered by the Institute: the [HDSI Undergraduate Research Scholarship](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/academics/undergraduate/financial-opportunities/) and HDSI Industry-Sponsored Research Scholarship. I turned my focus to research after my Undergraduate Research Scholarship project, ‚ÄúAdaptive Quantitative Group Testing Using Deep Q-Learning and the Walsh-Hadamard Matrix‚Äù, mentored by [Professor Tara Javidi](https://tjavidi.eng.ucsd.edu/), was picked as the best out of all projects of 20+ scholarship winners, and selected to be presented to the California Alliance for Data Science Education, based at UC Berkeley. 

I am currently conducting research under the UCSD Astrophysics Department's [Cool Star Lab](https://www.coolstarlab.org/), in ML-based identification of ultracool spectral binaries, supervised by [Professor Adam Burgasser](https://physics.ucsd.edu/Directory/Person/398). Around the same time I started this opportunity, I was working on training deep learning models on large-scale cyber-infrastructure for the [San Diego Supercomputer Center](https://www.sdsc.edu/). I am also working on a research project in **inverse reinforcement learning** at the [Existential Robotics Lab](http://erl.ucsd.edu/), supervised by [Professor Nikolay Atanasov](https://natanaso.github.io/) and [Tianyu Wang](https://tianyudwang.github.io/). Finally, I am mentored by [Professor Yusu Wang](http://yusu.belkin-wang.org/) in proposing a new multi-scale neural network architecture, based on clustering, GraphGPS, and sparse attention, that improves performance in tasks involving capturing **long-range dependencies in graphs**.

Despite my drive in research, my engagements in the industry have not slowed down. I built a proof of concept for a Snowflake data warehouse for **BlackRock**'s Aladdin Product Group, developed security capabilities for the Heroku platform with **Salesforce**, and created an end-to-end [synthetic data generation](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/) and deep learning training pipeline for real-life scenes with **NVIDIA**. Currently, I am building ML pipelines and infrastructure for **Tesla**'s internal manufacturing applications. I have also previously worked on machine learning, deep learning, and cloud capabilities and research projects with the [Scripps Research Translational Institute](https://www.scripps.edu/science-and-medicine/translational-institute/) (supervised by [Professor Giorgio Quer](https://www.scripps.edu/science-and-medicine/translational-institute/about/people/giorgio-quer/)), [RAPID AI](https://www.rapidai.com/?gclid=CjwKCAiAuOieBhAIEiwAgjCvcm3jaTLXUl_A0dPveCP5vSd55GwRP67oy_LKFfPXXFM8jnGsWXhERhoCgk0QAvD_BwE), [Tangible AI](https://tangibleai.com/), and [Blooma AI](https://blooma.ai/). I have also founded and served as a core backend, DevOps, and ML engineer for two startups, one of which participated in [The Basement](https://www.ucsdbasement.com/) and [StartR](https://rady.ucsd.edu/why/centers/ciid/inspiring-innovation/startr.html) incubators. I still occasionally do freelance ML work for various venture-backed startups.

After graduating, I plan to work in the industry in a Data Science, Machine Learning, Solution Architecture, or MLOps role, before applying to MS and PhD Machine Learning or Computer Vision programs. 

## educational background
I am pursuing a **B.S. in Data Science** (*3.83 major GPA*) at UC San Diego, planning to graduate in June 2023. Some highlighted experiences and extracurriculars (fun and academic) include:
- **1st place winner** of the advanced track, DataHacks 2021 (unanimous perfect score for my team), **mentor** for DataHacks 2022
- Ranked second out of 40+ students in the Introduction to Data Mining course Kaggle competition.
- **HDSI Undergraduate Research Scholarship** recipient (2021-2022). View the press release [here](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/congratulations-2021-hdsi-scholarship-recipients/).
- **HDSI Industry-Sponsored Research Scholarship** recipient (2020). One of two selected for the award, out of hundreds of applicants. Received an offer for an internship with [BD](https://www.bd.com/en-us) (rescinded due to COVID-19). 
- **Co-Director** (2021-2022) and **Technical Lead** (Fall 2022) of the Online Content Subcommittee of UCSD's [Data Science Student Society (DS3)](https://ds3.ucsd.edu/). View the committee's Medium publications and podcasts [here](https://medium.com/ds3ucsd).
- Authored the [Sigmet](https://pypi.org/project/sigmet/) Python library (2020) in a team of four in DS3, 1k+ downloads.
- Authored [Arpagen](https://github.com/camille-004/arpagen/blob/main/LIGN%20167%20Final%20Project%20Writeup.pdf), a corpus and LSTM benchmark for **phoneme-level text generation**. 
- Complex systems educational internship with the Qualcomm Institute's QI [Learning Academy](https://www.facebook.com/qualcomminstitute/posts/the-qualcomminstitute-is-proud-to-introduce-the-qi-learning-academy-an-innovativ/10158666314159813/?locale=es_LA) (Winter 2020).
- 2x participant (2019-2020, Fall 2021) in [The Basement Incubator](https://www.ucsdbasement.com/).
<!-- - **Reinforcement learning engineer** for [IEEE](https://ieeeucsd.org/) Project Drive (prepared for F1Tenth RL robot simulator competition). -->
<!-- - Other üè´ clubs: Producers and Remixers Organization (PRO UCSD) officer, Entrepeneurs' Club VP Internal and UI designer. -->

## fun facts
- I'm an avid electronic music producer and sound designer, with previous releases on an Amsterdam-based dance label.
- I am a former realism artist who used to upload drawing tutorials to YouTube. One went viral and hit nearly a million views, and was used in university art lectures around the world. 
- I'm obsessed with formatting and making things look pretty. As such, I must always keep my code rigorously documented, styled according to [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), and modularized. Admittedly, I sometimes spend too much time on this.
