I'm currently a Master student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Southern University of Science and Technology (CSE@SUSTech), under the supervision of Prof. [James J.Q. Yu](https://jamesyu.me/). In the future, I will continue pursuing my PhD studies at SUSTech and CityU under the supervision of [James J.Q. Yu](https://jamesyu.me/) and [Xiangyu Zhao](https://zhaoxyai.github.io/). Before that, I received my B. Eng. degree from Shandong University, Weihai. My research interest include deep learning in smart city and edge computing, intelligent transportation systems, and federated learning.
