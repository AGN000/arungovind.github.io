Hello! I'm Ziyang Guo. I am an PhD student in [Computer Science at Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/graduate/phd/). Currently, I work with Professor [Jessica Hullman](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jhullman/) at [MU Colective](https://mucollective.northwestern.edu/). Previously, I finished my undergratudate in [Computer Science & Technology](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), where I worked with colleagues from [ZJUIDG](https://zjuidg.org/).

My research interests mainly include uncertainty visualization, visualization grammar, model check visualization, and decision-making problem.
