I am a technology enthusiast with special interest in the latest developments in the field of NLP. My research interests include machine learning and AI methods, and applications to topics in (directed) technological change and innovation economics. I obtained my Ph.D. from Justus-Liebig-University Gießen in 2022. During my Ph.D., I was employed at the ZEW – Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research as Researcher and Data Scientist working on policy projects related to industry dynamics and innovation as well as on economic indicator development from unstructured data sources using state-of-the-art transformer models.
