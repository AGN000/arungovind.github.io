Hi! I'm Alessandro and I'm a PhD candidate at EPFL in the [Physics of Complex Systems Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/pcsl/) and the [Signal Processing Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lts4/), co-advised by Matthieu Wyart and Pascal Frossard.

The goal of my research is to advance the science of modern **machine learning** algorithms. I aim to understand why and how **artificial neural networks** work. I focus primarily on generalization properties, the role of **invariants**, and scaling theories, often building on insights from statistical physics. Lately, I'm studying the impact of **pre-existing knowledge** about the world, for instance **geometric priors**, on learning performance.

I enjoy working both studying analytical models and performing numerical experiments.

Before, I completed a joint Master's degree in **theoretical physics** at Sorbonne Universit√©, Politecnico di Torino, SISSA, and ICTP. In the past, I also worked on quantum information science in Turin.
