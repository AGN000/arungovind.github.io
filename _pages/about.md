Greetings!

My name is Zheyuan Zhang(张喆元 in chinese). You can call me Brian. I am an incoming Robotics MS student at [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). Prior to U of M, I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science(B.S.) from [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/) [College of Information & Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/).

View my latest CV [here](assets/cv.pdf).

My [research interests](blog/2022/about-my-research-interests/) lie in the intersection of artificial intelligence, robotics and cognitive science (cognitive psychology and neuroscience). I am particularly passionate about exploring how the brain works and how we understand the world. My goal is to build robots with high-level intelligence to have similar cognitive functionalities like humans and other animals, including perception, remembering, learning, reasoning, decision-making and motor control.

I have many hobbies. In my spare time, I enjoy playing games and watching TV-series. I went to gym 3-5 times a week lifting weights to train my physique. Besides, I am an audiophile who loves Hi-Fi devices including headphones, speakers, DACs, amplifiers.
