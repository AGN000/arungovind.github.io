I am a first year Ph.D. student in Economics at Emory University. My current academic interests are Macroeconomics and International Economics.

Prior to attending Universidad Centroamericana (UCA) in Nicaragua, I partook in some mathematical olympiads, most notably, the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) and the Iberoamerican Mathematical Olympiad (IbMO). I graduated *Magna Cum Laude* from UCA in April 2021 with a Bachelor's Degree in Applied Economics.
