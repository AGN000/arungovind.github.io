Hi there! I'm Shray, the creator of this website. Thanks for stumbling here. It is my sincerest hope that your experience is net-positive
and you discover something that aids you, even in the most miniscule manner. As the description states, small changes can have dramatic effects over time.
<br> <br> A little about me: At university (<a href="https://umich.edu/">Michigan</a>),
I immersed myself in a latticework of disciplines comprised of political economy, business, and economics (A.B & BBA). In particular, my academic
background has encouraged me to pose somewhat non-parochial questions to profound matters of our time, while assiduously pondering about how to frame
the complicated world around me in the face of radical uncertainty and ever-evolving challenges. In general, university unveiled numerous possibilities
and occasionally, it seemed as if I had opened an anti-pandora's box.
<br><br> My takeaway will be one remembering the love, knowledge, and memories that I shared with people who are on their own intrepid journeys. One chapter closes and the next must begin; quite the natural cycle. Moreover, I've dabbled
in entrepreneurial ventures, interned at a now-defunct investment company, built a private market-focused club after reading a book (yes, this is true),
and worked in a product role at a student-run tech business. My interests at large span from financial markets to academia to the arts. If you're interested in my experiences, here's my
