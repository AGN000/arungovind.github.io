I am an Assistant Professor at Abdullah GÃ¼l University. My research interest is in-vehicle communication, the security of cyber-physical systems, embedded systems, internet of things. I also have a curiosity about precision farming. I teach courses related to embedded systems and programming. 

I completed my postgraduate studies with a scholarship from the Turkish Ministry of Education. I received my Ph.D. in 2022 from Cranfield University where I focus on the security of in-vehicle CAN communication. Before that, I completed my MSc in embedded systems engineering from the University of Leeds with distinction in 2016.
