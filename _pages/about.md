Welcome to my GitHub page! I am RC Grear.

I recently graduated from Western Governors University with a degree in Data Analytics. I’m excited to share my journey, showcase the projects I’ve been working on, and connect with others with similar interests. During my time at university, I worked on real-world problems through my coursework, which helped me build a strong foundation in technical and analytical skills.

In addition to my degree in Data Analytics, I also hold a degree in Secondary Education with a focus on Chemistry. My teaching experience not only sharpened my subject knowledge but also strengthened my interpersonal and communication skills—both of which continue to serve me well in collaborative and professional settings.

Before I began teaching, I worked in the corporate world, where I gained valuable insight into how dynamic and fast-paced the business environment can be. Later, my husband and I moved to Vietnam, where I applied my teaching license in an international setting. It was a fulfilling and memorable experience, and I’m grateful for the incredible people I met along the way.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we realized the importance of being close to family, which led us to relocate to the United States. Through conversations with my in-laws and reading about the education system here, I came to understand how different teaching high school in the U.S. can be compared to Asia. This realization ultimately reignited my passion for data and technology, motivating me to pursue my long-time goal. Earning my Bachelor of Science in Data Analytics has brought that goal to life, and I’m now ready to take the next step in my professional journey.

I’m always eager to explore new ideas and broaden my skill set, so I hope you’ll check back here for updates on any fresh projects I’ve got in the works. If you’d like to connect, feel free to reach out—I’d love to hear from you!





Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
