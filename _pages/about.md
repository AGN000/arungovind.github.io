I am a fourth year PhD student at the University of British Columbia (UBC). I work with a microbiologist, [<u>Dr. REW Hancock</u>](http://cmdr.ubc.ca/bobh/), and a statistician, [<u>Dr. G Cohen-Freue</u>](https://gcohenfr.github.io/), which has offered me the perfect learning environment given my research interests. I am interested in using various statistical learning techniques to biological problems, particularly those involving an over-activated immune system. My PhD research centers on characterizing early [<u>sepsis</u>](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2819%2932989-7), with the goal of identifying biomarkers useful for triage/prognosis. Beyond research I do other things like, bike, swim, watch TV, sleep.
