Hi, I am a first-year student at Syracuse University, pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. My academic journey is defined by my interdisciplinary research spanning the departments of Computer Science and Finance, where I explore cutting-edge topics in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and financial systems.

Currently, I am researching how large language models (LLMs) mirror human memory, alongside advanced research in finance, focusing on algorithmic trading and financial market prediction. By bridging these fields, I aim to develop innovative solutions that merge AI advancements with real-world financial applications.

Aspiring to pursue a PhD, I am dedicated to contributing to transformative research that spans multiple disciplines. This site showcases my academic projects, research endeavors, and professional aspirations.

I currently do not have any publications, but I will soon update this.
