I'm an epidemiologist with interests in causal inference, machine learning, complex data fusion problems. I received my PhD in Epidemiology with Dr. Ashley Naimi at the University of Pittsburgh, and was as a Postdoctoral Fellow with Drs. Bryan Lau and Elizabeth Stuart at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Currently, I'm a Senior Biostatistician at GRAIL, LLC.
