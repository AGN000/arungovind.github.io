I am a Ph.D. student at the Machine Learning Department, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, working with Profs. [Jeff Schneider](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~schneide/) and [Tom Mitchell](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/). Prior to joining CMU, I graduated from McGill University, Canada, with a B.Sc. in Computer Science & Mathematics, where I worked with Prof. [Doina Precup](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup/index.html). Over the past two years, I’ve been on a leave of absence from CMU to build the ML team of an [early stage data privacy startup](https://www.relyance.ai/). I’m returning to CMU to finish my Ph.D. working on Embodied AI.
