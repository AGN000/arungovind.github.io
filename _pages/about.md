Hi there! I am a third year Ph.D. student in Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.

My research focus is in developement economics with particular interest in financial inclusion, agricultural finance, and cultural economics.

Before starting my Ph.D., I received a dual Masters in Public Policy and Applied Economics at the University of Michigan – Ann Arbor and my B.A. in Economics from the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM) in Mexico City.
