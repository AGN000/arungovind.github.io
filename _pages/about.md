Hi there! I'm Chinmaya Kausik, a rising 2nd year mathematics Ph.D. student at UMich working on **sequential decision making, statistics, optimization and machine learning**. I am being co-advised by [Prof. Ambuj Tewari](https://ambujtewari.github.io/) and [Prof. Martin Strauss](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~martinjs/).

Check out my [past projects](projects) (along with post-mortems), [publications](publications) and [interests](more)!

  <summary markdown="span"> <b> What do I care about, academically? </b> </summary>

  * Mathematical problems motivated by tangible, real-world questions. These days, my work focuses on **sequential decision making with offline data**. I also have side projects in **deep learning and control theory**, and I intend to combine my current interests with ideas in **differential privacy** very soon. On the other hand, a lot of my undergraduate background was in geometry, topology and dynamics, with work in computer-assisted topology and geometry. 
  * **Increasing accessibility** to and in higher mathematics and **creating communities** where ideas cross pollinate and people pull each other up. This is part of why I co-founded and co-organize [Monsoon Math Camp](https://www.monsoonmath.org) - an online math camp for promising high school students introducing them to advanced undergraduate and graduate-level math. You should check it out! I have also been involved in building and expanding other mathematical communities, like platforms for the PolyMath REU, DRP programs and the undergraduate math organization at IISc, etc.

  * Working on projects on offline RL in **confounded** tabular MDPs and learning **mixtures of MDPs**.
  * Thinking about **minimax optimal** algorithms for offline policy evaluation (**OPE**) and the role of the geometry of action sets.
  * Working on **double descent** in denoising under the guidance of [Rishi Sonthalia](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/rsonthal/home?authuser=0). Work continued from [MREG 2022](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/mreg-2022/home).
  * Continuing work on our project from [LOGML 2022](https://www.logml.ai/)! I was a participant in Dr. Eli Meirom's group, planning to work on using RL for graph **rewiring in GNNs** to prevent oversquashing for long range problems.
  * Mentoring undergraduate students on a project about using machine learning to enhance **model predictive control**.
  * Fleshing out ideas for more academic communities like **Monsoon Math**.

  <summary markdown="span"> <b> What do I want to learn about/do in the future? </b></summary>  
   
  _primary goals_
  * Work on learning other mixtures of time series with control input.
  * Work on generating synthetic data privately for time series, starting with MDPs and Markov Chains.
  * Learn about differential privacy and its intersection with sequential decision-making.
  * Start maintaining my progress [log](log) again.
  * Learn about safe RL and think about techniques beyond primal-dual ones, perhaps using model-based RL with uncertain models.
  * Watch lectures from the Data Driven Decision Processes program at the Simons Institute this semester.
  * Gain a comprehensive view of techniques that go into minimax lower bounds in RL.

  _side-quests_
  * The theory behind GNNs and deep learning in general.
  * Causality and its interaction with sequential decision making and RL.
  * Algorithmic fairness.
  * Geometric and topological insights for data analysis and machine learning (for example, non-positive curvature representation learning).
  * Natural Language Processing.
  * Using insights from machine learning for biology. In a specific example, learning a hierarchical or causal structure from genomics
