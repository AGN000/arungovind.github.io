I head the new ``Next Generation AI Research Center" at Fujitsu, Japan. I headed both the AI and AI security labs, in succession, at Fujitsu Research India. 
Prior to that, I was an Associate Professor in the Department of <a href="https://cse.iith.ac.in/" target="blank">Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)</a> at the <a href="https://iith.ac.in/" target="blank">Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IIT-H)</a>, where I head the <a href="https://krama.cse.iith.ac.in" target="blank">क्रम (Krama) Lab</a>. My research interests are applied algebraic topology (topological data analysis), geometric machine learning (graph and point-cloud representation learning), and optimal transport (discrete OT and assignment problems). My work involves developing practical machine learning algorithms with rigorous theoretical foundations.

Prior to my transition into academia, I gained 9 years of industry expertise as an architect (technical / systems / database) for companies like <a href="https://www.oracle.com/corporate/" target="blank">Oracle</a> on mission critical projects involving big data. This experience gave me a unique and deep perspective into the kind of AI work that would tightly interweave the future needs of industry, while also pushing the boundaries of current AI research. With this new purpose, I decided to join academia.

<p class="content">
First, I was a Masters student and researcher in the <a href="https://www.it.uu.se/research/group/udbl/" target="blank">Uppsala database laboratory (UDBL)</a> headed by <a href="https://user.it.uu.se/~torer/" target="blank">Prof. Tore Risch</a> at the <a href="https://www.it.uu.se/?lang=en" target="blank">Department of Information Technology</a> in <a href="https://www.uu.se/en" target="blank">Uppsala University, Sweden</a>, where I investigated the near-future prediction of continuously evolving moving-object trajectories. Then, I pursued a Ph.D. in the <a href="https://cs.au.dk/" target="blank">Computer Science Department</a> at <a href="https://international.au.dk/" target="blank">Aarhus University, Denmark</a>, where I was working on fast and approximate path-finding algorithms on massive 3D polyhedral meshes, under the guidance of <a href="https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/christian-s-jensen" target="blank">Prof. Christian S. Jensen</a>. Post that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.dima.tu-berlin.de/menue/database_systems_and_information_management_group/?no_cache=1" target="blank">DIMA</a>, <a href="https://www.tu.berlin/en/" target="blank">Technische Universität (TU) Berlin, Germany</a>, headed by <a href="https://www.bimos.tu-berlin.de/menue/bimos_people/members/professors/volker_markl/" target="blank">Prof. Volker Markl</a>, investigating scalable machine learning methods, especially, locality sensitive hashing (LSH).

<p class="content">
On securing a tenured faculty position at <a href="https://cse.iith.ac.in/" target="blank">IIT-H</a>, I have aggressively pursued AI research and collaborated with both academia and industry alike to create sophisticated next-generation AI tools.
