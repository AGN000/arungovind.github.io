Greetings! Welcome to my online profile. I am a theoretical researcher working in the field of computational science. I did bachelor in Materials Physics, and Master/PhD degree in Materials Engineering.

Currently, I'm a postdoctoral research associate in [CEDER](https://ceder.berkeley.edu/) group at University of California Berkeley. My current research is focusing on developing thermodynamic and kinetic computational frameworks to understand the energy landscape of inorganic solid materials.

Detailed information about my current research interests are presented in this site. If you have any questions or inquiries, please feel free to send an [email](jeffrey.oakley.ouyang@gmail.com) to me.
