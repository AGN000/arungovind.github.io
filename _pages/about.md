I will be starting as an **Assistant Professor of Computer Science** at [Cornell University](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/) in Spring 2023.

<!--and a member of the [PASSION Lab](https://passion.lbl.gov/), the [BeBOp Group](https://bebop.cs.berkeley.edu/), and the [Performance and Algorithms Research (PAR) Group](https://crd.lbl.gov/departments/computer-science/par/members/students/giulia-guidi/). Giulia received her M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering from [Politecnico di Milano](http://polimi.it/en).-->

I work on challenges at the intersection of large-scale computational biology and the algorithms and software infrastructures. I leverage high-performance computing techniques and computer systems and architectures to make genomics data processing faster and more flexible for the community, and to enable higher-quality bioinformatics and biomedical research. Another important focus of my work is developing software to make cloud infrastructures more accessible for high-performance scientific computing.

**I am recruiting PhD students with some background in parallel programming and interest in high-performance computing for computational sciences.** If you are a prospective PhD student, please read [the students page](https://giuliaguidi.github.io/students/). 

I received my PhD in Computer Science from UC Berkeley in August 2022 under the supervision of [Aydın Buluç](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~aydin/) and [Kathy Yelick](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yelick/) and my dissertation is titled "Parallel Algorithms for De Novo Long Read Genome Assembly via Sparse Linear Algebra". You can read about it [here](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2022/EECS-2022-196.html) and watch the defense recording [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMDICvkA5zw). 

I received a [2020 SIGHPC Computational & Data Science Fellowship](https://www.sighpc.org/for-your-career/fellowships/2020-fellowship-winners?fbclid=IwAR2N8swtCYgNH3phRmrFtASSC42b4oN5joG1l5XHFSdnkMY6U4HvZt3olLE) and work as a Project Scientist in the Applied Math and Computational Sciences Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

Here are a recent **[CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DmJgPIFg6S-B0bqvqWFUmrmk6czYVmy5/view?usp=sharing)** and the Tl;dr version of my **[Research Statement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_HVC4HkkyBMqUx8AiTHeyjgwlSdYG3j6/view?usp=sharing)**.

The best way to contact me is by **email**: gg434 at cornell dot edu.
