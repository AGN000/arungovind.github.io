Greetings!

My name is Tuo Liu, feel free to call me LT. I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Arizona. I major in Environmental Health Sciences, and minor in Biostatistics. My research interests include:

- Exposomics
- Application of Data Science tools in Public Health research, e.g., ML in biomarker identification 

I serve as Research Associate in the Burgess Lab and the Furlong Lab and focuses on the application of metabolomics in firefightersâ€™ occupational health improvement.

<!--- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
