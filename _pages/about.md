I am a PhD student in the [Department of History and Philosophy of Science](https://www.hps.cam.ac.uk) at the University of Cambridge where I am generously funded by the [Gates Cambridge Scholarship](https://www.gatescambridge.org/biography/18408/).

In addition to my PhD, I also serve as a Student Fellow at the [Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligece](http://lcfi.ac.uk).

My current research broadly concerns the epistemological and moral significance of machine learning in science and public decision-making. Tackling these issues leads me to confront fundamental questions concerning non-epistemic values in science, the epistemology of scientific practice, epistemic virtues, pluralism, and pragmatism. I have other projects in the philosophy of neuroscience, artificial intelligence, general philosophy of science, epistemology, ethics and political philosophy. 

Before Cambridge I was a student at the University of Houston where I earned my BA and MA in Philosophy.

I share my life with my brilliant [wife](https://paulinaezquerra.github.io) and our cat <a target = "_blank" href="assets/img/winston.jpg">Winston</a>.
