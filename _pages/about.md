The jLab researches wireless sensing and communications systems, with a focus technology that furthers sustainable practices. Our work includes designing novel sensing paradigms for agriculture, inventing techniques for ultra-low power communication in indoor sensor networks, and exploiting non-traditional energy sources, such as microbes, for sustainable sensing.
