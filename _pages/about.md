I am a data scientist at QuantumBlack. I'm there to help build and deploy tech 
products in the industry. The core of my work is dedicated to climate-tech.  

Before that, I did a PhD in Economics. I leveraged data 
science and natural language processing to 
unpack the innovation diffusion black box - one commit at a time. I created 
3 open source/data projects ([PatCit](projects/patcit), 
[PatentCity](projects/patentcity) and [TechLandscape](projects/techdiff)) 
which data have generated 14k+ downloads to date. I am thankful to Collège de France, 
[Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/){:target="\_blank"}, 
[EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/){:target="\_blank"} and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/){:target="\_blank"} for their financial support. 

Before and during my PhD, I worked as a data scientist, mainly as a contractor. I 
worked at [Kayrros](https://www.kayrros.com/){:target="\_blank"}, 
a French scale-up bringing transparency to the energy sector. I also 
contributed to [IPwe](https://ipwe.com/){:target="\_blank"}, a start-up on a mission 
to make the Intellectual Property market more efficient using Blockchain and 
Artificial Intelligence in partnership with IBM. Finally, I served at 
[CarbonFact](https://www.carbonfact.com/){:target="\_blank"}, a YC-backed start-up 
dedicated to automated carbon accounting of fashion items.   

In my early academic life, I graduated in Management from 
[HEC Paris](https://www.hec.edu/en){:target="\_blank"}, in Data Science from 
[ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/en/){:target="\_blank"} and in Economics from 
[Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en){:target="\_blank"}. I also 
completed B.A.s in Applied Mathematics, Economics and Politics at [Université Paris I 
Pantheon-Sorbonne](https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/){:target="\_blank"}.
