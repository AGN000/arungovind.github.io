I am a **senior undergraduate student** in in the Department of <a href='https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/dmst'>Management Science and Technology</a> **Athens University of Economics and Business**. I am also a member of <a href='https://www.balab.aueb.gr'>BALab</a>, where I conduct research related to software engineering and programming languages, under the supervision of Prof. <a href='https://www2.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/index.el.html'>Diomidis Spinellis</a>.

I am also a **research affiliate** at the Computer Science Department of **Brown University**, working on the <a href='https://binpa.sh'>PaSh</a> project, a shell-script parallelization project hosted by the Linux Foundation, under the supervision of Prof. <a href='http://nikos.vasilak.is/'>Nikos Vasilakis</a>.

My **research interests** include programming languages, software analytics, empirical software engineering and computer systems. I am always willing to speak with anyone (junior or senior) who feels the need to share or discuss anything, whether it be directly related to the above topics or not. I find the field of security particularly interesting but had not yet studied them in depth.
