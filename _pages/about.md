Master's student at IIT (BHU) Varanasi

Hi! I am Samyak.  I am pursuing Master of Technology in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse) at the [Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varansi](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/). For the last few years I have been broadly working on Machine Learning with a particular focus on Adversarial Robustness along with Generalizable and Explainable Machine Learning.
\\
\\
I have been working at the [Video Analytics Lab](https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/) at the [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/) for past two consecuitive years(2020-2021) and have been involved in deep learning projects particularly related to adversarial robustness, which have been published at the following [venues](./publications).
\\
I am also working with the [Theoretical foundations in AI](https://www.in.tum.de/tfai/people/students-and-interns) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) where I am working on understanding the learning dynamics, loss landscape and critical point solutions of linear neural networks. Besides this I actively participate in machine learning conferences and am serving as a reviewer at ICLR 2022.

Here is the link to my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d-grrWxJsIr0Ln6VSE2yMHkUhb5Wowxc/view?usp=sharing).
\\
Broadly I am interested in research topics related to:
Robustness: Adversarial Robustness, Domain Generalization, OOD Robustness, Explainable AI

Theory: Learning dynamics, Critical point solutions, Linear autoencoder

Generative models: GANS, VAE, Normalizing flows
