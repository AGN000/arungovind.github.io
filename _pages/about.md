Previously, I got my bachelor degree at School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University in June 2021. During which, I worked on reinforcement learning 
theory as a research intern supervised by Professor [Zhaoran Wang](https://zhaoranwang.github.io/) and [Zhuoran Yang](https://www.princeton.edu/~zy6/).
