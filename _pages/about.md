I am Ph.D. student at [Binghamton University](https://www.binghamton.edu/) studying relativistic quantum information and quantum computing. I am deeply interested in the physics of time and how information processing could lead to a thoery of emergent time. At Binghamton Unversity, I am a graduate researcher, teaching assistant, and lecturer. I will be completing my Ph.D. summer of 2023.
