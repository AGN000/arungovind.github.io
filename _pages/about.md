I am an interdiscplinary ecosystem scientist researching ecosystem succession after disturbances like fire and harvest. I specialize in remote-sensing techniques to quantify forest canopy structure using techniques like lidar (light detection and ranging), DAP (digital aerial photogrammetry) and various satellite monitoring approaches. Overall, I my work aims to provide forest managers with accurate and easy to use tools that explain the state of a forest after a disturbance in areas that are hard for boots-on-the-ground measurements.  

I am interested in collaborations to facilitate global monitoring of forest structure, microclimate dynamics, and ecohydrological components. I am proficient in coding, compiling various field and remote-sensing data, and various statistical analyses.
