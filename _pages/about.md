I am a data scientist at <a href="https://www.quantumblack.com/">QuantumBlack</a>, a McKinsey Company. I joined QuantumBlack to help build and spread beautifully engineered tech products in the industry.  

Prior to joining QuantumBlack, I was a PhD candidate in Economics. My research programme was all about technology diffusion. I leveraged data science and natural language processing to unpack the innovation black box - one commit at a time. I have received financial support from Collège de France, PSE, [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/). 

I also graduated in Management from [HEC Paris](https://www.hec.edu/en){:target="\_blank"} and Data Science from [ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/en/){:target="\_blank"}. During my last year at HEC Paris, I followed the Quantitative Economics and Finance track taught at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en){:target="\_blank"}. HEC Paris is consistently ranked among the world’s leading business schools, École Polytechnique is the leading French engineering school and ENSAE is the leading French school in data science. 

During my PhD, my free time has been divided between data science consulting and open source contributions. 

On the consulting side, I worked for [Kayrros](https://www.kayrros.com/){:target="\_blank"}, a fast growing French start-up bringing transparency to the energy sector. I also contributed to [IPwe](https://ipwe.com/){:target="\_blank"}, a start-up on a mission to make the Intellectual Property market more efficient using Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence in partnership with IBM.

On the open source side, [PatCit](https://github.com/cverluise/PatCit){:target="\_blank"} has been and remains my main project. It aims at connecting patents to the rest of the Innovation system (scientific articles, technological standards, etc) by leveraging non-standard and in-text patent citations that were previously unused. It involves large data pipelines and Natural Language Processing at scale. The project keeps improving and has already found its fair amount of users (and stars) and the resulting dataset counts more than [5,000 downloads](https://zenodo.org/record/4391095).
