Hi! Iâ€™m a PhD student in [Information Science at Cornell](https://infosci.cornell.edu/phd/), where I study algorithmic fairness with [Allison Koenecke](https://koenecke.infosci.cornell.edu/) and [Rene Kizilcec](https://rene.kizilcec.com/). I'm currently working as a research assistant on the ["Expanding AI Audits"](https://techethicslab.nd.edu/call-for-proposals/#:~:text=Expanding,-AI%20Audits%20to) team at NYU, and have collaborated on research with the [Algorithmic Justice League](https://www.ajl.org/) and the [Compliant and Accountable Systems lab](https://www.compacctsys.net/) at the University of Cambridge.

I'm also really excited about teaching ethical AI - most recently, I co-led a [Responsible AI course](https://nanrahman.github.io/capstone-responsible-ai/) for UCSD's Data Science Capstone.

Previously, I worked as a data scientist at a consulting firm, where I focused on conducting real-world algorithm audits. I received my BA in Computer Science and Philosophy, Politics, & Economics from the University of Pennsylvania.

In my free time, you can find me reading [vaguely upsetting novels](https://emmaharv.github.io/bookshelf/) (recommendations always welcome!) or training for the 2024 New York City Marathon (which I have qualified for not because I am fast, but because I completed the [9+1](https://www.nyrr.org/run/guaranteed-entry/tcs-new-york-city-marathon-9plus1-program)).
