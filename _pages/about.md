After study and work with them so many years, `meteorologist`, `geomorphologist`, `hydrologist`, `glaciologist`, `sedimentologist`, `geodesist`, `geologist`, `geophysicist`, ***I am none of them*** 🤷‍♂️

A spatial professional can do everything 💖 but end up doing nothing 💊

My childhood dream was to become a `academia scientist` (do really contribute to science). Now I'm age enough to admit that dreams is technically broken. Luckily, using geodata efficiently, unexpectedly is the key to work with them.
