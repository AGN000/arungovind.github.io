Pursued a broad multidisciplinary education @ Michigan, thereby exploring three disciplines; philosophy, political economy, and business. In general, I'm curious about technology, financial markets, academia, and the arts.

Voracious reader of contemporary literature with occasional dabbles in other historical periods. Currently, I'm reading: 1. what's wrong with economics: a primer for the perplexed by robert skidelsky 2. renewable energy: a primer for the twenty-first century by bruce usher 3. fooling some of the people all of the time: a long short story by david einhorn.

Professionally, I've either attempted to create tech-enabled businesses (failed plenty) or have worked in small, nimble, and close-knit organizations where autonomy, mastery, and purpose are at the crux. On the side, I'm trying to learn the basics of ML (part-time).
