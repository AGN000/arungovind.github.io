Hello there! I'm Chinmaya Kausik, a first-year mathematics Ph.D. student at UMich, with a background in geometry, topology and dynamics. I have nascent interests in statistical and reinforcement learning, especially offline RL and causality.

Other things I'm eager to learn about: geometric insights for representation learning (for example, hyperbolic representation learning), algorithmic fairness.
