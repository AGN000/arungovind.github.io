Currently working as a strategy & prediction specialist for [L2F](https://www.l2f.ch){:target="\_blank"}, a new start-up combining topological methods with machine learning. Previously studied pure maths and theoretical CS at Oxford (self-taught in ML). Master thesis in multi-agent learning.

Looking to do a PhD after some time at L2F. I'd like to find a nice area where 'abstract' mathematical understanding really complements and improves applications in AI. Maybe something like manifold learning? Also concerned about the widening gap between the very rich and everybody else. Could be worsened by AI if left to its own instruments.

Possibility of throwing away this cerebral life and trying something more heartful. Otherwise I love climbing, dancing, cold showers, trees and music. :)
