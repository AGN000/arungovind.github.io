I am a systems engineer with experience in both entrepreneurship and academic research. Currently, I am interested in environmental modeling to inform the multi-objective decision making of architects and urban planners. My current project is [Eddy3D](https://www.eddy3d.com), a performance-driven design toolkit to predict outdoor thermal comfort in cities.
Eddy3D is currently used at KPF, Buro Happold, Henning Larsen, Atelier Ten, Kieran Timberlake, and by researchers and educators at TU Munich, AIT, MIT, UPenn, University of Toronto, and Cornell.

I hold a M.S. in [Systems Engineering](https://www.systemseng.cornell.edu/se/programs/systems-ms-degree) from Cornell University, a M.Sc. in [Sustainable Building
Science](https://www.bgu.tum.de/en/enpb/home) from the TU Munich, and a B.Sc. in [Energy Engineering](https://www.et.studium.fau.de) from the FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg. While completing my Master's, I also studied [Technology Management](https://www.cdtm.de) at the Center for Digital
Technology and Management (CDTM) in Munich and led operations at [TEDxTUM](https://www.tedxtum.com/), helping to organize four major events around Munich that hosted 1500+ attendees.
