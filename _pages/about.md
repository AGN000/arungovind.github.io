I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Communication at Clemson University and one of the core faculty of John S. and James L. Knight Foundationâ€™s funded Media Forensics Hub. My scholarship takes a mixed methods approach that integrates computational methodologies and critical cultural theory to examine mainstreaming of supremacist ideology on the internet focused on race, gender, and religion. As a global, inferential, and multi-method critical computational social scientist, my work on social media and supremacist digital content integrates theory advancement, policy relevancy, and community activism. 


My [dissertation](https://scholarworks.gsu.edu/communication_diss/102/), which won the [National Communication Association](https://www.natcom.org/awards/2022-nca-award-winners) Gerald R. Miller Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award, engages with theoretical issues in propaganda and terrorism studies and illuminates the power of economic messaging within the virtual world of armed non-state actors. Using constitutive rhetoric, unsupervised machine learning, spatial territory approximations, network analysis, and time-series analysis, my research examines how armed-non state actors' communication output legitimizes an imagined statehood in the digital world. 

I completed my Ph.D. in Communication at Georgia State University, as a presidential fellow in Transcultural Conflict and Violence Initiative (TCV), M.A. in Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard University and B.A. in Near Eastern Studies and Economics at Cornell University.  Previously I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Communication and Public Policy at Northwestern University.
