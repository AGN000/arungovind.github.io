<b>Research and professional interests:</b> Algorithms, Operations Research, AI, Transportation.

My passion lies in building a two-way bridge connecting research and practice. I firmly believe that the widening gap separating academic research in computational fields from real-world applications is sub-optimal. This gap is owed to the immense intellectual, technical and societal barriers in connecting the two. On the other side of these barriers lies the dream I want to realize - **real-life challenges shaping the direction of research and fueling fundamental scientific and technological progress; and in turn, scientific and technological breakthroughs powering disruptions that change our world**.

My work spans research in theoretical Computer Science to develop algorithms and insights, applied research to develop technologies, and taking research out of the lab to build products.

<b>Short Bio:</b> Prior to founding my startup, I have been at Lyft Labs (core marketplace problems such as dispatch, matching, vehicle repositioning, walk optimization, and AV fleet management), Twitter (content relevance, advertisement targeting, user identity bridging and spatio-temporal user modeling) and IBM Research (biomedical information extraction and disambiguation for drug discovery).

Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Algorithms and Complexity group at [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home/) and in the College of Computer Sciences at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/).

I received my PhD in Computer Science from [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research](https://www.tifr.res.in/) and my undergraduate degree (B.Tech.) in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIT Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/).
