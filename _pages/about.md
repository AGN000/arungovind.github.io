I'm a graduate from <a href="https://www.unitec.ac.nz/">UNITEC</a> Auckland, New Zealand. As of writting, I'm still searching for my first professional Information Technology role.

With a passion for Information Technology and the capability it holds to transform the world, I look to build on skills gained throughout polythechnic and build this personal website to host guides, projects and my online Curriculum Vitae

Having a key interest in Information Security a lot of my own research and study pathways have been based on Cyber Security. This intails me to have a broad spectrum of knowledge covering Networking,
Coding, Security, Linux, Cloud and back end implemintation. 

For now, I'd like to see my skills build towards Microsoft administration whilst still building an archive of fun and interesting projects/guides to further expand our skills 

I'm excited for what the future has instore
