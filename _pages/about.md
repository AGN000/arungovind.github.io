I'm a freshman at the University of British Columbia, studying Data Science and specializing in Artificial Intelligence (AI). My love for AI was developed in the last four years where I participated in the AI Scholars Program and the 1:1 AI Research Mentorship at Inspirit AI, as well as the many independent projects I've completed and am working on. 

For what is not mentioned in my profile page, I hate operating systems and am working on deploying my first desktop in Arch Linux. Apart from academics, I am an avid pianist and have been playing every day for the past 12 years. I also love to play tennis and organize group gatherings with my friends at UBC!
