Hello! I am an Undergraduate student at  [Amrita Vishwa Vidhyapeetham](https://amrita.edu/). I have been fascinated by the power of modelling natural systems for long. I beleive that modelling systems gives us great power, which liberates us in some sense, to do what we intend to do. So, Here I am, on a quest to build intelligent systems that help us understand natural phenomenons and to push the frontiers of human  knowldege.Currently I am pursuing my BTech at the [Center for Computational Engineering and Networking](https://amrita.edu/center/computational-engineering-and-networking/) Headed by [Dr. K.P. Soman](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=R_zpXOkAAAAJ&hl=en).

At present, My research Intrests are in predecitive modelling , self-organizing systems, emergent phenomenons , agent based modelling, Graphs, Networks , Non-Linear Dynamics , Software Defined Radio and prospects of ILP methods on Graph Representation.  I am equipped with a strong foundation of Linear Algebra , Optimiszation techniques and Signal Processing Techniques, which largely aids my exploration. 

I am an curious researcher , love writing, both technical or otherwise. In my free time I write poems in English and Tamil, and into Photography and Cricket as well.
