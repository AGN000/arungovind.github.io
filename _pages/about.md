I'm an undergraduate student at Brigham Young University studying Computer Science and Statistics.  My research interests include Machine Learning and Computational Linguistics. 

I've had the privelege to work with several professors over my undergraduate experience: [Prof. Kevin Seppi](https://cs.byu.edu/faculty/kseppi){:target="\_blank"} doing natural langauge processing and metalearning, [Prof. Quinn Snell](https://cs.byu.edu/faculty/snell/){:target="\_blank"} doing computational health research into mental health and suicide prevention, and [Prof. Nancy Fulda](https://cs.byu.edu/faculty/neo){:target="\_blank"} with natural language generation.
