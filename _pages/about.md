I am a 3rd Year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at Texas A&M University, College Station . Previously, I have completed my Master of Science in Statistics from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur and Bachelor of Science in the same discipline from the Department of Statistics at St. Xavier's College, Kolkata. 

My research interests include Bayesian modelling, functional data analysis, graphical models and causal discovery.  

I am working under the supervision of [Dr Yang Ni](https://web.stat.tamu.edu/~yni/) and [Dr Raymond K.W. Wong](https://raymondkww.github.io) . Earlier, I have worked under the guidance of [Dr Amit Mitra](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~amitra/) of IIT Kanpur as a part of my master's thesis work.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
