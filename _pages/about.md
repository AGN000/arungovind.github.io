I'm a first year PhD student in Natural Language Processing at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"}, where I also did my undergrad. I'm jointly supervised by [Simone Teufel](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sht25/){:target="\_blank"} and [Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.github.io/authors/ryan/){:target="\_blank"}, and although I'm not sure quite what I want to specialise in just yet, previously my research has concerned [conceptual metaphor theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_metaphor){:target="\_blank"} and gender-bias mitigation. I used to be at [St. Catharine's College](https://www.caths.cam.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"}, but now I'm at [Magdalene](https://www.magd.cam.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"}, where I am funded by a [Leslie Wilson Vice-Chancellorâ€™s Scholarship](https://www.student-funding.cam.ac.uk/leslie-wilsonvice-chancellors-award-202021){:target="\_blank"}.

In my free time, I like to make films. Short films I've been involved with in the past have gone on to win Best Undergraduate Comedy at the [Ivy Film Festival](https://www.ivyfilmfestival.org/){:target="\_blank"}, and Best Fiction at [Watersprite](https://www.watersprite.org.uk/){:target="\_blank"}. Most recently I directed a large project with the [Cambridge Footlights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footlights){:target="\_blank"} called [Magpies Love Mirrors](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnkAuDjLdpnuKF5rW1vi4bg){:target="\_blank"} (disclaimer: it's not for everyone), and I am currently co-president of the [Cambridge University Film Association](https://www.facebook.com/CUFilmAssociation){:target="\_blank"} (CUFA).
