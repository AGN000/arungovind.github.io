I am plant biologist working in conservation genomics, quantitative genetics, and genomic methods development. My research interests are coalescing into a research program that bridges the gap between conservation, breeding, and advanced genomic methods. I primarily work on East Coast plants of conservation concern, including the Hemlocks and Walnuts, as well as studying evolutionary causes of conservation problems.

I am a project mentor in the <a href="https://isg.uconn.edu/biodiversity/">Biodiversity and Conservation Genomics Center</a> in the Institute for System Genomics at the University of Connecticut. As a mentor, I train undergraduates on genome sequencing, assembly, annotation. Using comparative genomic methods, the students receive training in whole-genome comparative methods, phylogenetics, and population genomics. The first cohort of students <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.12.539246v2.abstract"> sequenced and assembled a reference genome for the Butternut (<i>Juglans cinerea</i>).</a>

As a post-doc, I'm a member of [Jill Wegrzyn&#39;s lab](http://plantcompgenomics.com) in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at the University of Connecticut. I'm funded from a USDA NIFA AFRI post-doctoral fellowship (AFRI A1141) in the Plant Breeding for Agricultural Production program. Most of my work is posted to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/PlantGenomicsLab) for the Plant Computational Genomic pages.

If you are an undergraduate intested in plant conservation genomics, evolutionary biology, or genome assembly methods development, or have a project of your own in mind, get in touch!
