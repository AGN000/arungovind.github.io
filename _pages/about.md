My name is Juan Tzintzun. I hold BSc. Industrial engineering with a specialization in decision making by the University of Guadalajara and an MSc. Engineering management by the University of Alberta.

My current research projects are related to the design and analysis of planning algorithms for autonomous agents in intra-logistic applications,  efficient algorithms for solving pickup and delivery problems in robotic networks, time series forecasting, and machine learning approaches for solving combinatorial problems. Other research interests are optimization under uncertainty and the interplay between operations research and machine learning.

I have taken courses in operation research, linear optimization, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and non-linear optimization.
Advanced experience in Python, and considerable experience using Julia and MySql. Optimization solvers and tools I have use Gurobi, GLPK, AMPL, Pyomo.

Currently looking for Ph.D. positions!
