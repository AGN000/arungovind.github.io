<!-- A **Machine Learning Engineer** in progress. -->
A **Machine Learning Engineer** in optimization phase.


I'm a passionate AI enthusiast who loves diving deep—literally and figuratively! From enhancing underwater images with cutting-edge techniques to exploring the endless possibilities of machine learning, my projects are where curiosity meets innovation. When I’m not coding up solutions or reading research papers, you’ll find me eagerly soaking up new knowledge, fueled by a relentless positivity and drive to grow. Let’s just say, whether it’s deep learning or deep waters, I’m always ready to take the plunge!


##### **Education**

**Queen Mary University of London -- MSc in Artificial Intelligence** (Distinction)    
Queen Mary was my gateway to the frontier of Artificial Intelligence. I explored cutting-edge subjects like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Cognitive Robotics, diving deep into the complexities of visual data analysis and neural networks. Highlights included building VGG and ResNet models and enhancing underwater images with transfer learning—a perfect blend of theory and hands-on innovation.

**Acropolis Institute of Technology and Research -- Dual Degree: Master of Computer Application** (Distinction)  
At Acropolis, I mastered the essentials of computer science and dove into advanced subjects like Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Database Management Systems, and Cloud Computing. From designing efficient relational databases to programming in Python, C++, and Java, I learned how to bridge the gap between theory and practical, data-driven applications. These foundations ignited my passion for solving real-world challenges with technology.
