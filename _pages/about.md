I am the Head of [Lilly Music Library](https://tischlibrary.tufts.edu/our-locations/tisch-branches/lilly-music-library) at Tufts University. My academic training includes master’s degrees in library and information science from Simmons College, music with a concentration in musicology from Tufts University, as well as a bachelor of arts in music literature and performance from Northeastern University. I am also the co-founder of [Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online](https://www.sucho.org/), an initiative focused on safeguarding and preserving the digital cultural heritage of Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War.

I am interested in the exploration and application of digital humanities tools and methods in historical (music) research, and in the application of standards, including TEI and MEI, for open access research and publishing, and the use of minimal computing. I also work on nineteenth century music topics with a focus on gender, women, and performance criticism and reception. My publications include a book entitled [*The Life and Music of Teresa Carreño (1853-1917): A Guide to Research*](https://www.areditions.com/kijas-life-and-music-of-teresa-carre-o-ib041.html), and a [digital project](https://documentingcarreno.org/), which documents Carreño’s performance career with primary source materials, metadata, and transcriptions, as well as explores her performances and texts through data analysis and visualization tools. I also write about using digital humanities tools and methods to explore, visualize, and augment scholarship.

My work has been supported by the Music Library Association with a [Walter Gerboth Award](http://www.musiclibraryassoc.org/?page=gerbothaward&terms=%22gerboth%22) and the University of Connecticut with a School of Fine Arts Dean’s Research Grant.
