I am a postdoctoral researcher, working at the [Institute of Sociology](https://www.polsoz.fu-berlin.de/en/soziologie){:target="_blank"} at the Freie Universität Berlin, and at the [Center for Civil Society Research](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/trans-sectoral-research/center-for-civil-society-research){:target="_blank"} at the WZB Berlin Social Science Center.

__Research interests__: comparative politics, political participation, party competition, social movements, civil society, crisis politics, cleavages, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, research methods.

__Previously__ I received my PhD in December 2018 from the Department of Political and Social Sciences of the European University Institute, with a thesis on "Parties and protests in crisis-hit Europe: continuity and change in the structure of political conflict". Before that I studied political science at the Central European University with a focus on electoral politics. You can find my more detailed [cv]({{ '/cv/' | relative_url }}) here.
