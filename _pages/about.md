Amirhossein Moosavi is a Postdoctoral Fellow jointly appointed at the <a href="https://midas.umich.edu/">Michigan Institute for Data & AI in Society</a> and the <a href="https://ioe.engin.umich.edu">Industrial and Operations Engineering department</a> at the University of Michigan. He also serves as the Postdoctoral Affairs Co-chair at the <a href="https://umpda.rackham.umich.edu/">University of Michigan Postdoctoral Association</a> and as a Student Liaison at the <a href="https://connect.informs.org/healthapplications/home">Healthcare Application Society within INFORMS</a>. He is also serving as a project manager at the <a href="https://cheps.engin.umich.edu/">Center for Healthcare Engineering and Patient Safety</a>, mentoring graduate and undergraduate students and supporting healthcare operations management-related projects.

Amirhossein earned his PhD in Management Science from the University of Ottawa, Canada, and his expertise centers on healthcare operations management and learning-based advanced analytics. Currently, he collaborates with the Transplant Clinic at the Taubman Center and other experts across the university to enhance kidney transplantation decision-makingâ€”particularly by maximizing the use of lower-quality kidneys that are often discarded. In partnership with the Ottawa Heart Institute, Canada, he is helping improve operating room planning and scheduling through advanced modeling and data-driven insights. Committed to advancing equitable and efficient healthcare systems through interdisciplinary collaboration, Amirhossein also strives to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical clinical/operational outcomes.

Outside of work, he enjoys exploring new cities, going to movie theaters, cycling, and staying active.
