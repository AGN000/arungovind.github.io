Hi, My name is Minyoung An. I am a PhD candidate in the School of Sociology at [the University of Arizona](https://sociology.arizona.edu/person/minyoung).

My research examines how gender and gender inequality embedded in society shape an individual’s behavior. Substantively, I investigate the interaction between a societal context and individuals’ behaviors, including migration and return migration, boundary makings in political identity, and the specialty choices of medical students. 

To explore such inquiries, I deploy a wide variety of methods, including quantitative methods, in-depth interviews, content analysis, and computational methods.
