Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

My name is **Sinong Wang**. I am a sophomore at the **Northeastern University of China** and I expect to graduate in 2023. And I participated in the joint training program and received a master's degree in computer science from the **University of Texas at Arlington** (2021-2023).

I also got a **4.0/4.0** GPA at UTA which has taught me Machine Learning and AI.

I am not satisfied with the knowledge I currently have, I want to explore the frontiers of human knowledge, and I will cherish every opportunity to progress myself.
