Hi! I’m a senior data scientist in Deloitte’s AI & Advanced Analytics group, where I focus primarily on improving patient health outcomes and advancing health equity through an intersection of analytics and behavioral science. I’m particularly interested in achieving these goals through algorithm auditing, and have collaborated on ethical AI research with the Algorithmic Justice League and with the Compliant and Accountable Systems group at the University of Cambridge.

Prior to joining Deloitte, I double-majored in Computer Science and Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at the University of Pennsylvania, where I graduated summa cum laude.

In my free time, I’m on a multi-boro quest to identify the best pizza in New York (recommendations welcome!).
