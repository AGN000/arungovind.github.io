My research areas are broadly under the category of signal processing. In particular, my focus is on sampling theory and signal representation.

I work at the Spectrum Lab in the Department of Electrical Engineering, under the supervision of [Prof. Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula](https://sites.google.com/site/chandrasekharseelamantula/). Previously, I was at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka where I completed my Bachelors in Technology in Electrical and Electronics Engineering.

My PhD is graciously funded by the Prime Ministers' Research Fellowship (PMRF). Please find more information about PMRF [here](https://pmrf.in).
