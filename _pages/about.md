Hi there! I'm Chinmaya Kausik, a first-year mathematics Ph.D. student at UMich, with a background in geometry, topology and dynamics. A lot of my undergraduate work is in computer-assisted topology and geometry. I have nascent interests in statistical and reinforcement learning, especially offline RL and causality. 

Check out my [projects](projects) (along with post-mortems) and [interests](more)!

**What do I care about, broadly?** 
* Mathematical problems motivated by tangible, real-world questions.
* Increasing accessibility to and in higher mathematics and creating communities where ideas cross pollinate and people pull each other up. This is part of why I co-founded and co-organize [Monsoon Math Camp](https://www.monsoonmath.org) - an online math camp for promising high school students introducing them to advanced undergraduate and graduate-level math. You should check it out! I have also been involved in building and expanding other mathematical communities, like platforms for the PolyMath REU, DRP programs and the undergraduate math organization at IISc, etc.

**What am I doing these days?**
* Learning reinforcement learning theory. 
* Taking graduate electives in math - especially excited about Math 626 (topics course in probability covering ergodic theory, Markov chains and mixing times) and Math 797 (the coarse geometry of Teichmuller space).
* Learning about Rishi Sonthalia's TreeRep algorithm for efficiently learning metrics on trees (hyperbolic representation learning).
* To provide a glimpse into graduate student life and also create a greater sense of accountability for myself, attempting to maintain a [periodic log](log) of my academic/professional progress on this website. 
* Working on finishing up the GUI for my algorithm for generalized Seifert matrices. 
* Gearing up for Monsoon Math 2022!
* Fleshing out ideas for more academic communities like Monsoon Math.

**What do I want to learn about in the future?**
1. Causality and its interaction with sequential decision making and RL.
2. Natural Language Processing.
3. Using insights from machine learning for biology. In a specific example, learning a hierarchical or causal structure from genomics data.
4. Geometric and topological insights for data analysis and machine learning (for example, non-positive curvature representation learning).
5. Algorithmic fairness.

**Collaborators and mentors:**
This list is highly incomplete and unordered, but I have greatly benefitted from interacting with and learning from the following amazing people: Prof. Alex Wright, Prof. Siddhartha Gadgil, Prof. Subhojoy Gupta, Prof. Stefan Friedl, Jose Pedro Quintanilha, Miraya Poddar-Agrawal, Julian D'Costa, Abishek Rajan.
