Welcome to my personal research site. I am plant biologist who works in the fields of genomics,  conservation biology, and quantitative genetics. Currently, I'm a postdoc in [Jill Wegrzyn&#39;s lab](http://plantcompgenomics.com) in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at the University of Connecticut. I received my Ph.D. from the University of Vermont under the direction of [Stephen Keller](https://www.uvm.edu/~kellrlab/index.html) where I worked on describing the effects of hybridization on disease dynamics in poplars.
