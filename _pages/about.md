Welcome to my site! 

I am a PhD student in Economics at [Indiana University](https://economics.indiana.edu/). My research interests focus on macroeconomics with emphasis on household finance and financial markets. Throughout my work, I study the interaction of micro-level heterogeneity, idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks and economic policy.
