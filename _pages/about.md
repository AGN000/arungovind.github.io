I am a visualization researcher and professor at the Department of Informatics of the University of Bergen. I investigate methods for gaining insight into complex data to further scientific understanding and discovery, medical diagnosis and treatment, and engineering, as well as techniques for communicating these findings to the public. Building on these foundations, my current interests include the development of novel interactive approaches for the inquiry of large-scale heterogeneous data spaces in data-driven science.

Before my professorial appointment in Bergen in 2013, I was an assistant professor at the TU Wien, Austria where I also received my Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2008 and was awarded habilitation degree (venia docendi) in Practical Computer Science in 2012.

I have co-authored over 100 research papers on a variety of topics in visual computing including work on topics such as uch as illustrative visualization, volume rendering, smart visual interfaces, biomedical data visualization, and visual parameter space exploration.

I was program co-chair of EuroVis, PacificVis, the Eurographics Workshop on Visual Computing for Biology and Medicine, the Eurographics Medical Prize, and part of the editorial board of the Computers & Graphics. I am an ACM Distinguished Speaker, currently serve on the Eurographics Executive Committee, and am a member of ACM SIGGRAPH, Eurographics, and the IEEE Computer Society.
