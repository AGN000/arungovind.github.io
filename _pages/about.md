Greetings!

My name is Zheyuan Zhang (张喆元 in chinese). You can call me Brian. I am a Robotics MS student in the [Robotics Institute](https://robotics.umich.edu/) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). Prior to U of M, I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science (B.S.) from [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), [College of Information & Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/).

My [research interests](blog/2022/research-interests/) lie in the intersection of artificial intelligence and cognitive science because I am extremely passionate about exploring how the brain works, how we understand the world and how to simulate or even replicate intelligence using computational models (e.g. neural networks), that includes processing visual and semantic information. To this end, I want to use insights and inspirations from cognitive psychology and neuroscience to advance fields including deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing, multimodal learning, continual learning, embodied intelligence, generative models and robotics.
