I'm a Ph.D. researcher at the Natural Language Processing Lab, University of Illinois Chicago. I am interested in applications of NLP and machine learning in healthcare and social media domains.  

My research uses machine learning to infer religion from personal names in South Asia and uncovers underlying linguistic differences in names. I have also worked on automated summarization of scholarly text for lay-person and multi-perspective answer summarization for consumer health queries on a community QA forum. Currently, I am investigating markers of Type II Diabetes using electronic health records.  

Previously, I worked as an Assistant Professor (teaching) of Computer Science at Keshav Mahavidyalaya, University of Delhi, and as an Associate Software Engineer at Objective Systems Integrators prior to that. I hold a Master's in Computer Applications from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Delhi, and a Bachelor's in Physics from the University of Delhi, India.
