Welcome to to the Epidiagnostics Group at Johns Hopkins University! We are an interdisciplinary cadre of researchers working together to gain deeper insights into the epigenetics of carcinogenesis to apply this knowledge toward developing novel molecular analysis methods for cancer diagnostic applications. Our core group is comprised of faculty with a wide range of complementary expertise, including: <a href = "/members/Pisanic">Dr. Thomas Pisanic </a> (biomarker discovery and epigenetic assay development), <a href = "https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/tza-huei-jeff-wang/"> Dr. Tza-Huei Wang </a>(engineering and microfluidic technologies), <a href ="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/hariharan-easwaran">Dr. Hari Easwaran </a> (epigenetics of aging and cancer) and <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/leslie-cope">Dr. Leslie Cope</a> (biostatistics and bioinformatics). We also work with a diverse array of <a href ="/collaborators">extraordinary collaborators</a> at Johns Hopkins as well as numerous partner institutions to apply our epigenetic methods to resolve manifold challenges in various areas of cancer research.
