Hello, my name is Matin Kositchutima, a student from KVIS. I'm currently 16 years old right now. I do many things, `photography`, `writing`, `programming`, etc.. 

I'm interested in Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science, Cyber Sercurity, and Philosophy. I'm currently doing 2 academic projects right now, one about drug combination therapy, and another about NLP. I also have some other projects such as [my blog][thephilosophersblog.com].

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can # put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
