I am an Assistant Professor of Economics in the Department of Economics and Finance of the College of Business and Economics. Prior to joining Qatar University in September 2016, I have taught in Aix-Marseille University.

My areas of interest and expertise are found mainly in the domains of economic analysis of law and institutions,  contracts theory,  cryptocurrencies, Islamic finance and banking, and development economics.
