Hello! I am Arushi Khokhar, a third year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science and Engineering from Jaypee University of Information Technology, India. Currently, I hold concurrent research positions at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore and National University of Singapore (NUS). At IISc, I'm a part of the [Intelligent Inclusive Interaction Design Lab](https://cambum.net/I3D.htm) advised by [Dr Pradipta Biswas](https://cambum.net/PB/about-me.php). At NUS, I am a part of the [Multi-Agent Robotic Motion Lab](https://marmotlab.org/) advised by [Dr Guillaume Sartoretti](https://marmotlab.org/bio.html).

## Research Interests
My long term research goal is to develop autonomous systems which are capable of robust real-time decision-making just like the human brain. To achieve this, I've been working at the intersection of machine learning (deep learning and reinforcement learning) and robotics. Currently, I'm working on multi-agent collaboration using distributed approaches. <BR> <BR>
Along with this, the biomechanics of various human activities have always sparked my curiosity. Since my freshmen year, I've been learning various aspects of mobility in humans and animals. I'm really interested to work on intelligent rehabilitative and assitive devices using robotics, machine learning and reinforcement learning.
Prior to my current research internships, I've spent 7 months working with Dr Vineet Vashista at the Human-Centered Lab, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Gandhinagar. During these months, I studied the biomechanics of walking and worked on a controlled, monitored, and digitized alternative to conducting standardized functional gait assessment tests.
