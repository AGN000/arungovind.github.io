My research area is in the interdisciplinary field of Learning Theory, Representation Learning, Graph Networks, Probabilistic Modelling, Meta-Learning and Reinforcement Learning. I’m specifically interested in the intersection between AI and physics, and how we can rigorously apply AI to learn space-time evolution of a dynamical system.

I am enchanted by the beauty of mathematics, physics and I enjoy coding, I learn everyday from experts and explore new methods and revolutionary approaches by staying update and being active on AI communities. I’m also passionate about innovation, using the next technology before anyone else has heard of it, and making crazy ideas turn into the best machine learning models based on rigorous approaches for impactful solutions in scientific communities such as climate science. I am an intern at <a href="https://mila.quebec/"> MILA</a> supervised by <a href="https://yoshuabengio.org/"> Yoshua Bengio</a>, <a href="https://www.uqar.ca/universite/a-propos-de-l-uqar/departements/unites-departementales-des-sciences-de-la-gestion/benabbou-lobna" > Loubna Benabbou</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kGSzBpMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" > Dianbo Liu</a>. I also hold a Master from <a href="http://www.groupe-centrale.com/">Ecole Centrale Casablanca</a>.
