Giulia is a PhD candidate in Computer Science at UC Berkeley and a graduate research assistant at the Computational Research Division of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory advised by [Aydın Buluç](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~aydin/) and [Kathy Yelick](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yelick/), and a [2020 SIGHPC Computational & Data Science Fellow](https://www.sighpc.org/for-your-career/fellowships/2020-fellowship-winners?fbclid=IwAR2N8swtCYgNH3phRmrFtASSC42b4oN5joG1l5XHFSdnkMY6U4HvZt3olLE). 

Giulia will be an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at [Cornell University](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/) starting Spring 2023.

<!--and a member of the [PASSION Lab](https://passion.lbl.gov/), the [BeBOp Group](https://bebop.cs.berkeley.edu/), and the [Performance and Algorithms Research (PAR) Group](https://crd.lbl.gov/departments/computer-science/par/members/students/giulia-guidi/). Giulia received her M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering from [Politecnico di Milano](http://polimi.it/en).-->

Giulia is working on the challenges of large-scale computational biology and the algorithms and software infrastructures that meet the usability and performance demand of this community, as well as how to make cloud computing more accessible for high-performance scientific computing.
Giulia's research goal is to make writing high-performance genomics code as easy as writing high-performance deep learning code.
Giulia is generally interested in the intersection of High-Performance Computing (HPC), Computer Systems, and Computational Biology as enabling technologies for faster, high-quality bioinformatics and biomedical research.

<!--Currently, she is developing a novel algorithm for de novo assembly of genomes in distributed memory using long-read sequencing data and sparse matrix abstraction as part of the [ExaBiome](https://sites.google.com/lbl.gov/exabiome) project.-->

Here are a recent **[CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DmJgPIFg6S-B0bqvqWFUmrmk6czYVmy5/view?usp=sharing)** (April 2022) and the Tl;dr version of my **[Research Statement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_HVC4HkkyBMqUx8AiTHeyjgwlSdYG3j6/view?usp=sharing)**.

**I am recruiting PhD students for the 2023/24 Academic Year.**
