I am a systems engineer with experience in both entrepreneurship and research. Currently, I am interested in environmental modeling to inform the multi-objective decision making of architects and urban planners. My current project is [Eddy3D](https:www.eddy3d.com), a performance-driven design toolkit to predict outdoor thermal comfort in cities.
Eddy3D is currently used at KPF, Buro Happold, Henning Larsen, Atelier Ten, Kieran Timberlake, and by researchers and educators at TU Munich, AIT, MIT, UPenn, University of Toronto, and Cornell.

I am holding a M.Sc. in [Sustainable Building
Science](https://www.bgu.tum.de/en/enpb/home/) from the TU Munich and a B.Sc. in [Energy Engineering](https://www.et.studium.fau.de/studieninteressierte/bachelorstudium/) from the FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg. While completing my Master's, I participated in the [Technology Management](https://www.cdtm.de) program at the Center for Digital
Technology and Management (CDTM) in Munich and led operations at [TEDxTUM](https://www.tedxtum.com/) helping to organize four major events hosting 1500+ attendees.
