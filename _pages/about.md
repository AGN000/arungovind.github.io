Climate change has become a main global challenge with countries committed to achieving carbon-neutrality by 2050. Nuclear fusion, a safe and potentially unlimited energy source, could provide the ultimate energy solution to our kind. 

Singapore has founded a new lab in fusion science, namely the NTU-CEA Joint Centre for Fusion Energy, supported by NRF and 
TEMASEK.  We endeavour to combine the power of traditional physics-based models, high-performance computer simulations and modern machine learning technologies to accelerate the realisation of fusion energy. This will be combined with advanced plasma diagnostics ready to use for the next generation fusion machines.

The joint centre is currently hosted by Nanyang Technological University.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
