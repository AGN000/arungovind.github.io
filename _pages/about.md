I have been at Lyft Labs (dispatching, shared rides matching, vehicle repositioning, passenger walking, and fleet management), Twitter (advertisement and recommendation) and IBM Research (biomedical document classification and disambiguation).

Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Algorithms and Complexity group at [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home/) and in the College of Computer Sciences at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/).

I received my PhD in Computer Science from [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research](https://www.tifr.res.in/) advised by [ Prof. Jaikumar Radhakrishnan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaikumar_Radhakrishnan), and my undergrad degree (B.Tech.) in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIT Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/).
