Despite having a Master of Public Policy from KDI School, my other academic qualifications include Master of Public Administration, Master of Management Sciences and Euro – Asia Summer School – Exchange Program. I studied a number of relevant courses my time being in education such as Econometrics I, Econometrics II, Impact Evaluation Methods, Statistical Inferences, Development Economics and Public Policy & Governance. In addition to that I took part in Stata, R & MS-Excel workshops for data analysis offered by [KDI School](http://reddit.com)  applied my learning in analysis of Impact Evaluation Studies mentioned below. Studying these enriched courses and workshops increased my research and analytical skills.
My professional experience includes 5-Year as Data Analyst at Cadet College Hasanabdal where I work on various data analysis tools to identify the patterns, risks, & impact. I worked 1-Year as Research Associate in the Joint Project of KDI School and COMSATS University Islamabad titled “Impact Evaluation of Punjab Land Record Management Information System” funded by KDI School. In this, we have utilized Difference-in-Difference and Instrumental Variable Approach paired with Falsification Tests in Stata-17 for evaluating the impact of program on several socioeconomic indicators. In addition, my master thesis is also centered on impact evaluation study titled “Impact Evaluation of Vocational Training Institutes in Punjab province, Pakistan”. I used Fixed Effect Regression paired with Instrumental Variable Approach for evaluating influence of program on trainees’ output using Stata-17 & R. I have utilized Regression Discontinuity Design in my master thesis in Pakistan in which I examined the “Impact of Prime Minister’s National Laptop Scheme on Graduates Performance in the Job Market”. My independent current research projects include “Conservational Practices & Environmental Dynamism”, “Numerical Quantification of Industry-Academia Linkages” and “Coup D’état and Democracy utilizing Correlate of War – Survival Dataset & Atomic Energy Datasets” employing a rigorous econometric approach. I also published two papers in impact factor journals on the topic “Life Quality & Happiness in MENA Region”. Link to your favorite . You can put a picture in, too.
