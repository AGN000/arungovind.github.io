I am an Applied Economist from Universidad Centroamericana (UCA), Nicaragua. So far, my research experience has comprised international economics and development economics. Macroeconomics and monetary economics are also part of my academic and professional interests.

Before entering UCA, I had participated in several mathematical olympiads, most notably, the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) and the Iberoamerican Mathematical Olympiad. I am still actively involved in olympiad activities as an Euclidean Geometry instructor at Academia Sabatina de JÃ³venes Talento (ASJTNIC), Nicaragua.

I engaged in research contests during higher education, such as the 17th Symposium for Young Researchers, organized by UCA, and the 2020 Economics, Finance, and Development Award, carried out by the Central Bank of Nicaragua.

I will join the Economics Department of Emory University as a Ph.D. student next fall.
