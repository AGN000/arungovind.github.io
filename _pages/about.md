Welcome to my personal research site. I am plant evolutionary biologist who works in the fields of conservation biology, evolutionary genomics, and quantitative genetics. Currently, I'm a postdoc in [Jill Wegrzyn&#39;s lab](http://plantcompgenomics.com) in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at the University of Connecticut.

This website build is in progress - it's a mess for now :D

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
