I am Ph.D. student at [Binghamton University](https://www.binghamton.edu/) studying relativistic quantum information and quantum computing. Straight out of high school I began studying mathematics with an interest in number theory. Through a series of unfortunate events I was unable to complete my degree at that time. After a few odd jobs, I landed as a cook and later chef working in various restaurants including one that was Michelin rated. Despite my success in the restaurant industry I eventually decided I needed to go back to school to finish my education. During the transitionary phase I developed a keen interest in the physics of time and have been curious about this field since. For a more detailed (and personal) story take a look at my [Blog](https://ericaspling.com/blog/).

Currently my research interests lie in how information processing could lead to a theory of emergent time. My particular expertise is in studying Unruh-DeWitt detectors in quantum computing to combine the formalism of quantum field theory with quantum computing and condensed matter systems. At Binghamton University, I am a graduate researcher, teaching assistant, and lecturer. I will be completing my Ph.D. summer of 2023 under the supervision of [Michael Lawler](https://lawlergroup.lassp.cornell.edu/).
