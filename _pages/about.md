I have a strong passion for data science both in work and in personal life. I strive to see how to extract value from data and use it in real life situations. 

In one of my pet projects I used the data from a GPS-tracker to create behavioral models of my cat,  and I used the models to detect/predict abnormal behavior, to estimate arrival times, to predict most likely ruts, and so on. I used methods such as  density-based clustering and Markov Chains. 

In other of my pet projects I craeted an algorithm which automatically assigns review tasks to conference participants by maximizing the expertise of the reviewers. This came out of my frustration when being a conference chair and having to manually find adequate reviewers for papers. I figured out that it would be faster for me to create an AI which automates the assignment than doing the assignment manually. The novelty in my method was in formulating an Assignment Problem of combinatorial nature as a Convex problem, thereby allowing efficient large-scale implementations. 

Other of my pet projects resulted in autonomous drone navigation in mines based on on-baord cameras. This used simple and efficient computer vision methods which could be programmed in an on-baord chip and allow navigation in real life.
