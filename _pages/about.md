Hi! My name is Henrique. I'm a software engineer at Google currently searching for a team.

Previously, I worked on semantic parsing and question answering models for Google Search, created voice queries for electric vehicles on Google Asssistant, and tried product management at [Landed](https://gotlanded.com).

I recently graduated from [Princeton University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) with a B.S.E. in Computer Science and minors in Applied Math, Optimization, and Statistics & Machine Learning. I conducted research in natural language processing (pruning, embeddings, song recommendation, cannabis strains) and theoretical CS (learning, auctions, tournaments). My senior thesis was advised by [Matt Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/).

I am half Paraguayan and half Brazilian, and grew up in [Asunción](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asunci%C3%B3n) speaking four languages (Spanish, Portuguese, Guaraní, and English).
