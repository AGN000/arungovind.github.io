I am currently a third-year PhD student in Computer Science at [Texas Tech University](https://www.ttu.edu/), doing 
research in interactive data visualization and visual analytics. I'm a member of the  [interactive Data Visualization Lab (iDVL)](https://idatavisualizationlab.github.io/), where I work with [Prof.
  Tommy Dang](http://www.myweb.ttu.edu/tnhondan/).


  Across the vast range of interactive data, my research interests include **interactive data
  visualization**, **visual analytics** and **human-computer interaction**, supporting the
  understanding and insight discovery of quantitative and qualitative data. I build web-based interactive
  visualization with [D3.js]((https://d3js.org/)) and I study to construct a template
  for event  detection mechanisms in visualizing time-series data.
  

Before I joined the PhD program at TTU, I graduated with a B.S. in Information Systems at [Hanoi University
 of Science and Technology](https://en.hust.edu.vn/), Vietnam, in 2018. I worked with [Dr. Oanh Nguyen](https://soict.hust.edu.vn/can-bo/ts-nguyen-thi-oanh.html) on object 
 detection and multi-label image classification. I also worked as a Big Data intern at [VC Corp](https://vccorp.vn/) on 
 handling distributed storage with HDFS and Map-Reduce.

Besides my professional activities, I play the ukulele, love walking and hiking in beautiful places. I trekked Mount 
Fansipan, Vietnam's highest mountain (3,143 m / 10,312 ft) ⛰️
