My name is Xin Liu. I'm a fourth year PhD student at the Computer Vision Lab of Delft University of Technology, supervised by <a href="http://jvgemert.github.io/">Dr. Jan van Gemert</a>. 

My main research interests include efficient deep learning for video object detection/tracking, segmentation, and action recognition, optimization for efficient training of DNNs on large-volume temporal data, and top-down networks with small size, low-resolution inputs to achieve training efficiency. Because I'm generally interested in video learning, I'm also exploring possibilities of NeRF for Video.

Besides that, I also enjoy playing tennis and bass guitar.

If you're interested to collaborate, feel free to drop me an email.
