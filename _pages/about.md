I am a Full-Stack Web and App Developer.

My Interests include Blockchain Technology, Backend Engineering (Server-side programming), Network Engineering, Database engineering and DevOps.

I aim on gaining competence in end-to-end development which involves the following steps:

- Vetting the idea for practicality and drawing it's Architecture Diagram via System Designing.
  - This involves selecting the various Cloud Service Providers for the app, the DB architecture and deployment platforms.
- Designing and testing the UI/UX via wireframes and interactive figma designs.
- Development in accordance with industry standard design patterns and trusted APIs.
- Using DevOps tooling for containerizing the application and orchestrating it on a chosen Cloud Platform.
