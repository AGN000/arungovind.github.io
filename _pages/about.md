Currently working as a strategy/modeling/machine learning specialist at [L2F](https://www.l2f.ch){:target="\_blank"}, a new start-up in EPFL's Innovation Park. Previously studied pure mathematics and a little CS (self-taught ML). Master thesis in multi-agent learning, paper to come.

Aiming to do a PhD after some time at L2F. I'd like to find a nice area where 'abstract' mathematical understanding really complements and improves applications in AI. Maybe something like manifold learning? I like everything from geometry and analysis to algebra and number theory.

Otherwise I love climbing, dancing, cold showers, trees and music. :)
