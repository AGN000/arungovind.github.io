Greetings!

My name is Zheyuan Zhang (张喆元 in chinese). You can call me Brian. I am a Robotics MS student in the [Robotics Institute](https://robotics.umich.edu/) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). Prior to U of M, I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science (B.S.) from [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), [College of Information & Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/).

My [research interests](blog/2022/research-interests/) lie in the intersection of artificial intelligence and cognitive science because I am extremely passionate about exploring how the brain works and how we understand the world, that includes how humans and animals process visual and semantic information. Therefore, I am interested in multimodal learning (e.g. computer vision with natural language supervision), multitask learning, generative models and robotics. Additionally, I want to use insights and inspirations from cognitive psychology and neuroscience to advance fields in AI/ML and robotics.

I have many hobbies. In my spare time, I enjoy watching TV-series (especially for the genres of mystery and thriller) and playing games (was). I usually go to gym 3-5 times a week lifting weights to train my strength and physique. Besides, I am an audiophile who loves Hi-Fi (high fidelity) devices including headphones, speakers, DACs and amplifiers.
