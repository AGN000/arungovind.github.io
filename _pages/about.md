Hello, I am a `Physical Geochemist`and study ore fluid processes using FT-MS and IR spectroscopy, with a focus on IR lasers for measuring solvated ion clusters. The experimental set-up includes a modified Bruker FT-MS facility and a OPO/OPA laser system that delivers tunable infrared radiation in the mid IR range. We also use DFT and ab initio calculations to understand molecular cluster structures and properties.

As an instructor I teach courses in aqueous geochemistry `(EASC2401), (EASC2406)`, the science underpinning WMD system and the implications on proliferation and terrorism`(CCGL9033)`, and the origins of life `(CCST9018)`.
