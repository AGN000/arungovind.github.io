I am a Research Assistant at [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research](https://www.tifr.res.in/), working under the guidance of [Prof. Sandeep Juneja](https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~sandeepj/). 

I am broadly interested in probability, stochastic processes and theoretical understanding of machine learning systems. Currently, I work on developing machine learning techniques for efficient rare-event analysis. I am also contributing to the development of a data-driven weather forecasting model for India.


Prior to this, I spent a year at [Optym](https://optym.com/), building optimization software for [Less-Than-Truckload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less-than-truckload_shipping) carriers. I graduated from [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/), where I was fortunate to receive mentorship from [Dr. Kiran Seth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiran_Seth).
