We are a new, multidisciplinary lab in the Department of Physics at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. We study fundamental principles governing molecular processes essential for life. In particular, our goal is to resolve single molecule's action during gene expression and eventually understand how molecules work together inside living cells.
