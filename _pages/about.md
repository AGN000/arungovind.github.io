Welcome! I’m currently a Senior Machine Learning R&D in the [AutoMLx](https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=94065:12:32018698560791:224) team at [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/), working on the AutoML backend of the [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/) Database and AutoML for time-series forecasting. I’m broadly interested in all aspects of machine learning (ML), particularly Automated ML (AutoML), Scalable ML infrastructure design, anomaly detection, and forecasting.

Before [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/), I was a Research Developer in the Benchmarking team at [D-Wave](https://www.dwavesys.com/). During this time, I was working on benchmarking real-world quantum annealing computers against classical computers on a vast range of optimization problems. 

Before [D-Wave](https://www.dwavesys.com/), I was a Machine Learning Developer in the [AlphaLayer](https://alphalayer.ai/) team at [AltaML](https://altaml.com/). The focus of my research there was the soft clustering of assets into different sectors in an unsupervised fashion and designing backtesting approaches to analyze the performance of long-short arbitrage strategies in the global equity market. 

During my MSc at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html), my research focused on predicting unstructured merge conflicts in collaborative software development. This project was partially funded by Samsung Canada. Prior to this, I received another master’s degree from the [Ferdowsi University of Mashhad](https://en.um.ac.ir/) in Computer Engineering where I was working on the impact of causality relations in sparse ML models. 

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking in the beautiful nature of British Columbia, travelling, and cooking!
