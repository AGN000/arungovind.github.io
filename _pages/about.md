Throughout my career, I have worked with geologists, geophysicists, geomorphologists, hydrologists, glaciologist and other specialists to explore the complex connections between different disciplines by geodata science; Even though I am still none of them ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 

As ~~a full stack geospatial professional~~ with a diverse range of skills, I experienced a fantastic journey to [explore various disciplines](https://geo.w.uib.no/files/2020/01/Poster-The-Geological-Society-Geoscience-for-the-future-scaled.jpg), from discovering offshore oil to carbon capture and storage, from glacial mass balance to hydrological models, from examining [the origin of landforms](https://zhihaol.eu.org/blog/2022/Quaternary-geomorphology-of-Norway/) to predicting [permafrost changes at 2100](https://zhihaol.eu.org/blog/2022/permafrost-extent/). [All things connected !](https://i.imgur.com/wldOmMO.png) and enormous treasures hidden by geodata:

If we know more about the variability of snow mass, the energy system will be more robust in hydropower production areas, such as Norway, Switzerland, Southwest China, etc. Likewise, if we have a more precise and bias-free climate observations & models, we will cope with the uncertainties associated with climate-change-related risks and opportunities for energy, environment and society.
