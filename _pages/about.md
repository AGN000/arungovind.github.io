I am an incoming PhD student in computer science at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/), advised by [Hanspeter Pfister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanspeter_Pfister). I am deeply interested in data visualization, biomedical imaging, and computer vision. My latest research focuses on applications of data visualization in neuroscience and climate sciences. I mainly work on novel domain-specific methods to process and visualize large-scale data sets efficiently.

I hold a MSc in visual computing and a BSc in medical informatics from [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/en/). During my studies, I had some amazing opportunities to conduct research abroad. For my master thesis research fellow I was visiting the [Visual Computing Group](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University. Before that, I was interning in Markus Hadwigerâ€™s [High-Performance Visualization Group](http://vccvisualization.org/) at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en) and at [Brainlab](https://www.brainlab.com/), Munich.
