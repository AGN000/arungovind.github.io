Ciao ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alessandro and I'm a PhD candidate at EPFL in the [Physics of Complex Systems Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/pcsl/) and the [Signal Processing Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lts4/), co-advised by Matthieu Wyart and Pascal Frossard.

The aim of my research is to enhance our understanding of modern machine learning algorithms, with a focus on the interplay between *data structure*, *architecture*, and *generalization* in deep learning. In particular, I'm interested in exploring how the geometric structure of natural data, for instance symmetries, invariances, and compositionality, enables *efficient learning* in high-dimensional spaces.

I enjoy working both studying analytical (toy) models and performing numerical experiments.

Previously, I completed a joint Master's degree in *theoretical physics* at Sorbonne UniversitÃ©, Politecnico di Torino, SISSA, and ICTP.
