I am a CSE PhD Candidate in Clarity Lab at the University of Michigan advised by [Prof. Jason Mars](https://www.jasonmars.org/). My research is focused on the design of novel systems and approaches optimized for scalable artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructures primarily in NLP & HAI.

Outside of UM, I am a Lecturer êž® in the Department of Computer Science at the [University of Guyana](https://uog.edu.gy), as well as a Director on the board of [Nexus Hub](https://www.nexushubinc.org/) and [V75 Inc](https://v75inc.com/). 

At Nexus Hub & V75 Inc I focus on the advancement of Guyana's technology sector spearheading initiatives geared towards fostering collaboration, supporting innovation, youth development and enabling economic stability for all of Guyana. I completed my Bsc. in Computer Science at the University of Guyana and I was born and raised in [Georgetown, Guyana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyana). 

In my spare time, I enjoy playing sports (mostly weight lifting), learning new areas (e.g economics), traveling, and hiking (warm temperatures preferred).
