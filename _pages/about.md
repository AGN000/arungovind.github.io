I am Qiuyang Mang (忙秋阳 in Chinese), a third-year undergraduate at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, under the guidance of Prof. [Pinjia He](https://pinjiahe.github.io/). I am currently interning at [Trustworthy Engineering of Software Technologies (TEST) Lab](https://nus-test.github.io/), advised by Prof. [Manuel Rigger](https://www.manuelrigger.at/). 

My focus lies in AI Robustness (e.g., developing automated tools for testing and improvement the AI software), and Testing traditional systems (e.g., databases and compilers), and graph algorithms.



I am highly involved with Competitive Programming, and in the 46th ICPC world Final List (Egypt). Prior to this, I earned one second runner-up and one third-place positions at ICPC Regionals, representing The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.
