I am Abdur Rahman, a passionate and determined individual hailing from Chennai, India. Currently, I am pursuing my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in cybersecurity at SRM University. My journey in the world of technology has been diverse and ever-evolving.

My interests span across various domains, with my current focus squarely on the exciting realm of cybersecurity. However, I have had the privilege of gaining hands-on experience in application and web development, building a solid foundation in networking, and mastering command-line tools. I have always been an avid explorer of the vast tech landscape.

My journey in technology has been marked by notable achievements, including the successful completion of projects like "QR-based Attendance Tracking" and my current endeavor, the development of a "File Encryption System Using AES-256 over HTTPS." I have worked with a range of tools and technologies, from Cryptography to PostgreSQL, and even dabbled in the world of design with experience in Framer and the up-and-coming Rive application.

During my academic journey, I have enriched my knowledge with valuable experiences, including an internship at Inforill Technologies. I also embarked on a design internship on Rive, where I contributed to an e-Learning Japanese application.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I indulge in a variety of extracurricular activities. As a chess enthusiast, I immerse myself in the strategic intricacies of the game. I am an outdoors person who embraces a love for sports, exemplified by my achievement of completing a 100-kilometer cyclothon and a full marathon covering 42 kilometers.  I find solace in listening to "Darknet Diaries" on Spotify, which offers intriguing insights into the world of cybersecurity.

Continuously striving for personal growth, I am also dedicated to learning the Japanese language and have successfully completed the N5 examination, currently progressing towards the N4 level.

My journey is marked by a commitment to learning, exploration, and a drive to excel in both academic and extracurricular pursuits. I look forward to further challenges and opportunities that allow me to make meaningful contributions to the world of technology and beyond.
