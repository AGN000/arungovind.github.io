Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate with the [Artificial Intelligence and its Applications Institute](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/aiai) at the University of Edinburgh. I am currently a member of the [Technology Usability Lab in Privacy and Security (TULIPS)](https://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/tulips/) and the Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (CHAI) Lab. My research focuses on developing intelligent tools for better phishing attack detection and mitigation.
 
My amazing supervisors are [Dr. Nadin Kokciyan](http://www.nadinkokciyan.com/) and [Dr. Kami Vaniea](https://vaniea.com/).
