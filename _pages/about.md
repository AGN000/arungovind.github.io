<!-- ## About Me -->

Hello world! I'm Alex, a data scientist based in London.

I am a Senior Data Scientist at Intuit, specializing in Text Matching, LLM-related tasks, and A/B testing. I started my journey as a Data Analyst, but quickly switched to Data Science, as it was more related to my academic background. My detailed career path is reflected in my <a href='/cv'>CV</a>.

As an Individual DS, I worked on various significant projects, including:

- Development of Compliance and Credit Scoring Models
- Deployment of BERT to Prod for CS optimization
- Time series forecasting, uplift modeling etc

Later, I took on a Team Lead role, working on large scale projects, managing teams and hiring data specialists. The key projects during my TL tenure were:

- Promotion Optimization – forecasting hundreds of thousands of time series daily to optimize revenue and market share
- Pricing Models – predicting prices for millions of goods, balancing revenue, stock levels, cannibalization and other effects

After relocating to Israel, I returned to IC role and joined Intuit, where I worked on impactful projects, e.g:

- DS projects for Data Aggregation Platform, resulting in optimization and error rate reduction by 30%
- Founded and led Data Science Guild, professional community for experience & knowledge sharing (70+ members)

And in August 2024 I moved to London, where I'm currently working as a Senior Data Scientist at Intuit. My work includes classical ML tasks (classification and matching) and LLM-related projects, as well as statistical analysis and experimental design.

## Why This Portfolio?

I'm a full-time Data Scientist, a proud father, a husband, and a dog parent. I don’t contribute a lot to open-source projects or participate in DS competitions, but I believe that after **8+ years in the field**, I’ve gathered a lot of knowledge and experience worth sharing.

This portfolio is my way of giving back. I’ll be sharing:

- Hints & Tips I wish I had earlier
- Code Snippets for tricky problems
- Guides & Checklists for DS workflows

I hope this will be helpful. Please feel free to reach out—I’d love to connect!
