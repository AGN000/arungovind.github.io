My name is Qiuyang Mang (忙秋阳 in Chinese). I am an year 3 undergraduate student at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and fortunate to be advised by Prof. Pinjia He.

I am interested in AI Robustness (e.g., developing automated tools for testing and improvement the AI software), and Testing traditional systems (e.g., databases and compilers), and graph algorithms.

I am currently doing an internship at Trustworthy Engineering of Software Technologies (TEST) Lab for half a year, advised by Prof. Manuel Rigger.
