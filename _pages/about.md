Hello! I am currently a Compute Science Ph.D. student at University of California, Irvine (UCI), supervised by [Padhraic Smyth](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~smyth/) and [Sameer Singh](https://sameersingh.org/). 
Prior to joining UCI, I worked as a research data scientist at the Responsible AI (FATE) group at Feedzai, under the direction of [Pedro Saleiro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saleiro/?originalSubdomain=pt). There, my research focused mostly fairness, explainability, and reproducibility aspects of Machine Learning (ML) pipelines in the context of fraud detection.
