I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Center for Imaging Science](http://cis.jhu.edu/) at [Johns Hopkins University](www.jhu.edu), working with Professors [Carey E. Priebe](http://www.ams.jhu.edu/~priebe/) and [Joshua T. Vogelstein](https://jovo.me/). Previously, I completed my PhD in the [Department of Statistics](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), advised by [Professor Liza Levina](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~elevina/).

My research interests include statistical network analysis, machine learning and high dimensional data analysis, and applications to neuroimaging.

I received a B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics and a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from the [Mexico Autonomous Institute of Technology (ITAM)](www.itam.mx).



Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
