I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Strategy & Entrepreneurship at the [Norwegian Business School (BI)](https://www.bi.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. 

My research is focused on financing entrepreneurship and innovation, economics of digitization and their intersections. Broadly, I study how digital technological change and economic crises affect innovation, entrepreneurship and firm growth. In particular, I study how digitalization is changing entrepreneurial financing and strategy (esp. in crowdfunding settings), and how the experiences of founders and funders shapes their decision-making. I also explore how firms’ financial and non-financial resources affect their innovations and growth. 

I currently teach Innovation Strategy and Technological Change, and Machine Learning for Business at BI, and previously taught on startup financing and econometrics.

So far results of my research have been published in [Entrepreneurship, Theory and Practice](https://doi.org/10.1177/1042258720958020) and [Small Business Economics](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11187-019-00309-8). You can find my publications [here](/al-folio/publications/) or on [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Pn3NdMgAAAAJ&hl=en)
