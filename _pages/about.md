Hello! I'm currently a master's student at the `Politecnico di Milano` in Italy following studies in Mathematical Engineering & Statistical Learning. Before that I went to `Queen's University` back in Canada for my bachelor's degree where I studied  Engineering Mathematics & Applied Mechanics. 

I'm interested in the intersection between statistics and deep learning and have had the opportunity to explore this field more in depth through my thesis work as a visiting researcher at [Human Technopole](https://humantechnopole.it/en/) under supervision by Michela Massi in the Di Angelantonio & Ieva Group.  

In the past I also had the opportunity to work under Dr. Allan Willms and Dr. William Langford in the [Guelph Climate Dynamics Laboratory](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/William-Finlay-Langford-Lab) on problems related to the mathematical modelling of climate change trends.
