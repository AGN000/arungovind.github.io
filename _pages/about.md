After study and work with them so many years, `meteorologist`, `geomorphologist`, `topographist`, `hydrologist`, `glaciologist`, `sedimentologist`, `geodesist`, `geologist`, `tectonicist`, `geophysicist`, `seismologist`, I am none of them🤷‍♂️.

My childhood dream was to become a scientist. Now I'm age enough to admit that it's hard to be an `academia scientist` (do really contribute to science). There is still a chance to work in industry as `researcher` or `scientist`. Because HR is normally more generous than academia.

Thanks to learning nature science, 


Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
