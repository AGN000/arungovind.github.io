Hello! I am a CS Ph.D. student at University of California, Irvine (UCI), supervised by [Padhraic Smyth](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~smyth/) and [Sameer Singh](https://sameersingh.org/). my research focuses on the responsible use of generative-based language models (LM) for natural language tasks.

Prior to joining UCI, I worked as a research data scientist at the Responsible AI (FATE) group at Feedzai, under the direction of [Pedro Saleiro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saleiro/?originalSubdomain=pt). There, my research focused mostly fairness, explainability, and reproducibility aspects of Machine Learning (ML) pipelines in the context of credit fraud.

I am currently interested in Responsible AI challenges both for tabular and textual datasets, with a high emphasis on the practical implications for the different personas involved in-the-loop. I am also broadly interested in multi-objective optimization and model analysis/evaluation. My work is supported by a CS Department Excellence Fellowship and a Fulbright fellowship.
