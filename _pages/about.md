I'm an AI research engineer at <a href="https://naver-career.gitbook.io/en/teams/clova-cic">NAVER AI Lab & CLOVA</a>.
At NAVER, I'm researching <strong>generalizable representation learning</strong> for temporal and relational data.

I received my B.S. and M.S. degree in Aerospace Engineering from KAIST in 2017 and 2019, respectively, 
under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v5hGAWMAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Han-Lim Choi</a>.
During my masterâ€™s degree, I researched <strong>planning and control </strong> for robots (e.g., humanoid) and 2) <strong> hierarchical RL </strong> to bridge the gap between high-level reasoning and low-level control policies.
