I am an MA student in the [Department of Philosophy](https://www.uh.edu/class/philosophy/) at the University of Houston. 

I work generally in ethics. My main research interests include practical reason, human agency, moral psychology, and Latin American Philosophy with a focus on the study and development of the history of Mexican philosophy. 

I am currently thinking about transformative experiences and the problem these pose for rational decision-making. 

Outside of philosophy, I enjoy cuddling with my cat, making jewelry, drinking coffee, traveling and getting lost in bookshops with my [husband](http://phkieval.com).
