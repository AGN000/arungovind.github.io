I'm a computer science BSc. student at the Technion and currently working as an algorithm developer.

My main interest areas are autonomous systems, machine learning, and quantum physics.
I also do web development and digital marketing for various businesses.

Currently researching for algorithms that can predict future atrial fibrilation sessions in patients by reading their ECG signals.
