Hello there! I'm Chinmaya Kausik, a first-year mathematics Ph.D. student at UMich, with a background in geometry, topology and dynamics. A lot of my undergraduate work is in computer-assisted topology and geometry. I have nascent interests in statistical and reinforcement learning, especially offline RL and causality.

Other things I'm eager to learn more about: geometric insights for representation learning (for example, representation learning techniques that use curvature-sensitive embeddings), algorithmic fairness.

Lately, I increasingly care about mathematical problems motivated by tangible, real-world questions. I also care about increasing accessibility to higher mathematics, and this is part of why I co-founded and co-organize [Monsoon Math Camp](www.monsoonmath.org) - an online math camp for promising high school students introducing them to advanced undergraduate and graduate-level math. You should check it out!
