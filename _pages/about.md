Hi there! My name is Sayuri Sekimitsu. I'm currently a MD candidate at [Tufts University School of Medicine](https://medicine.tufts.edu){:target="\_blank"}. I'm still exploring different specialties (there are so many fascinating options!), but I'm really passionate about the power of machine learning, and data science in medicine.

I grew up in Tokyo, Japan and studied biomedical computation at [Stanford University](https://exploredegrees.stanford.edu/soe-ug-majors/biomedicalcomputation/){:target="\_blank"}. After graduating, I also worked at [Boston Consulting Group](https://www.bcg.com){:target="\_blank"} as an Associate for two years, working primarily in healthcare and global health.

In my free time, I love to read books, bake all sorts of pastries, and go on long runs, walks, and hikes. If you have any Boston recommendations for bookstores, bakeries, or trails, please reach out!
