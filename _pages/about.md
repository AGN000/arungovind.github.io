Hi, I am Asgher Ali :wave: I am currently doing a Ph.D. at the Department of Mathematics, Syed Babar Ali School of Science and Engineering, LUMS, Lahore. I am broadly interested in optimal control applied to continuous models arising from antibiotic and radiobiological dosing problems. 

<p><strong>Research interests</strong>: computational mathematics, numerical optimization, data-driven PDEs solution, modeling and simulations, optimal control theory, parameter estimation, stochastic modeling.

<p><strong>Let me know if you have an open post doc position on these (or adjacent) topics.</strong>
