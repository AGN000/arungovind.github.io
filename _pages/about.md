Hi! I'm Miles, a PhD studying experimental, high energy, particle, physics. I'm interested in all things physics, in particular computational and mathematical physics and machine learning applications to fundamental physics experiment. Primarily, I am an experimentalist but am always looking to expand my horizons. 

Currently, I am affiliated with the [ATLAS](https://atlas.cern) collaboration at [CERN](https://www.home.cern) working with the $$H \rightarrow \tau\tau$$ analysis. Previously, I worked on algorithm development for $$\tau$$ energy scale calibration at the ATLAS experiment using a novel Mixture-Density-Network approach. I plan on continuing these efforts in both analysis and algorithm development.
