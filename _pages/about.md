Research interests: Neural mechanisms underlying skilled movements, sustained performance, and motor sequences. Biofeedback systems, brain computer interfaces, adaptive neural interfaces. 
Isabella Fallon is currently a postdoctoral associate under Henry Yin at Duke University School of Medicine. There, she is studying how neural circuits generate skilled movements. She aims to leverage this understanding to build innovative biomedical devices that restore loss of motor function. 

In May 2024, she received her PhD in Neurobiology from Duke University School of Medicine where she studied how striatal circuits contribute to decision making and kinematics under Dr. Henry Yin. Her work identified a novel 'push-pullâ€™ mechanism of striatal circuits that determines movement trajectories towards goal targets. 

In May 2017, Isabella received her B.S. in Psychology and Neuroscience from the University of Colorado Boulder where she researched the neural prophylactic effects of exercise and stressor control under Dr. Steven Maier. For her work, she was awarded the Best Undergraduate Thesis in Neuroscience, 2018 Women Who Make a Difference nomination, Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program-HMMI Research Grant, Biological Sciences Initiative Scholars Program Summer Award Research Grant, and the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program Research Assistantship Award.

Isabella is devoted to mentoring students including thoes from underrepresented backgrounds and has done so through the URS program at Duke University, the Duke athletics student mentorship program, and the BSI and UROP program at University of Colorado Boulder. 

In her free time, Isabella loves spending time outdoors skiing, trail running, climbing and playing sports. She loves to travel and enjoys all things in life.
