  This is a personal website for Holly-Moore-McMiller. I am a Cornell MEng
  student in Operations Research and Information Engineering with expected graduation in 
  May 2021. I am driven, meticulous and an inquisitive learner who is eager to tackle any
  challenge of any size. I find myself drawn to solving complex problems in big data and hope to explore career opportunities in data science.

  This website will familiarize you with some of my previous academic projects and some of my personal interests. Thanks for visiting and have an amazing day!
