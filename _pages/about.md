Hello! 

My name is Matheus, and I'm a philosopher interested in episodic memory, cognition, and neuroscience!

Currently, I'm completing my Master's degree at the beautiful Federal University of Santa Maria ([UFSM](https://www.ufsm.br)), in Brazil :brazil:

The focus of my current work is how mechanistic crtieria of constitution can help us to delineate the neurocognitive systems for episodic memory and imagination. 

You can find out more about my research by taking a look at [my CV](/cv/), or my [PhilPeople page](https://philpeople.org/profiles/matheus-diesel-werberich).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
