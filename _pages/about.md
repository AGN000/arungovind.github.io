Welcome to my site! I am currently a post-doctoral researcher studying cancer systems biology at the University of Virginia in the <a href="https://systemsbioe.org/">Janes Lab</a>. My work is part of the <a href="https://sasco.virginia.edu/">Center for Systems Analysis of Stress-adapted Organelles (SASCO)</a> that combines systems biology with mathematical modeling and data science to solve complex biological problems. I focus on computational modeling of dysregulated of chromosomal segregation during mitosis in cancer. After receiving a B.S. in <a href="https://www.wm.edu/as/physics/">Physics</a> and <a href="https://www.wm.edu/as/mathematics/">Mathematics</a> from The College of William & Mary in 2016, I entered Vanderbilt via their <a href="https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/qcb/">Quantitative and Chemical Biology program</a> and completed my PhD in the Quaranta Lab in March 2022, where I modeled regulatory networks and phenotypic transitions (cell state plasticity) in Small Cell Lung Cancer. I consider myself a physicist by training and a computational biologist by practice. My research experiences in undergrad, graduate school, and my post-doc allow me to combine these identities to approach complex biological problems through the analysis and modeling of high-dimensional data.
