I'm a second year PhD student in economics at Boston University. My research focuses on economic history, political economy, development and growth. I'm interested in applying machine learning and text analysis methods to economic research.

I hold a BSc and MA in economics from Universidad de los Andes. I previously
worked as a predoctoral fellow at <a href="https://econ.columbia.edu/per/">PER</a>. I'm originally from  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monteria"> Montería</a>, Córdoba, Colombia.
