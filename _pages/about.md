I am interested in developing interpretable AI methods for scientific research. These methods include **approximate inference**, **geometric learning**, **deep generative models**, and **symbolic regression**. I am particularly interested in applying these methods to **complex and collective systems** to derive new rules for living and non-equilibrium systems and integrating these rules into **active learning** and **experiment design**.

I completed my PhD in Engineering Mathematics from University of Bristol in 2018 for my research on how to `hear' material stiffnesses at the nanoscale. Following my PhD, I worked on the evonano project where I developed a computational pipeline for the automatic discovery of nanomedicines. I am now a researcher in the Mayor lab, developing computational models for cell migration and investigating how to extract mathematical models directly from data. My research has been generously supported by funding from EDF, Sellafield, and EPSRC (2014/18), EU Horizon 2020 FET-Open (2018/20), Wellcome Trust (21/22) and the Alan Turing Institute (2021).

In my free time, I hike, hitchhike (pre-pandemic), cross-country run, and look after a scruffy Bedlington Whippet.
