I am a first year PhD student in Economics and Public Policy at Tufts University. Broadly, I am interested in how big data can be leveraged to create novel data products and advise policy makers in low and middle income countries. I am eager to explore migration, urbanization, and inequality in developing economies.

Before starting grad school, I was a Research Associate at [Development Data Lab](https://www.devdatalab.org/) where I worked with large administrative datasets in India as published on [SHRUG](https://www.devdatalab.org/shrug). I assisted on projects regarding residential segregation, judicial bias, upward mobility, and COVID-19 in India. I am currently coauthoring a paper on the long-run effects of canal irrigation on structural transformation in India. I also worked with a project management team to guide the development of the National Data and Analytics Platform, [NDAP] (https://ndap.niti.gov.in/), a site that harmonizes administrative datasets across time and space to ensure public data is truly publicly accessible.
