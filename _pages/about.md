I am a second-year PhD student at MIT, advised by Professor [Vivishek Sudhir](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j4NKNWQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). My research interest is `quantum precision measurements`. In my experiment, <i>cavity optomechanics, quantum optics, and electronics</i> are heavily utilized, while on the theory side, <i>quantum physics, stochastic processes, and various topics</i> are extensively considered.

Before coming to MIT, I received B.E. and M.E. degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Tokyo Institute of Technology and the University of Tokyo, respectively. Then, I completed my military duty at KAIST as a research associate, where I studied frequency combs, time/frequency standards, and precision measurements.
