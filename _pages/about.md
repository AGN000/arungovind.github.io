I am a PhD Student at the Computer Science Graduate Program of Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (<a href='https://ppgcc.dcc.ufmg.br/en/'>PPGCC/UFMG</a>) in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. I obtained my MSc and BSc degrees in Computer Science from the same university in 2021 and 2018, respectively. 

I am currently a member of the <a href='http://www.labcsx.dcc.ufmg.br'>Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Computer Science (CS+X)</a> and my research is focused on data analysis on collaborative domains, such as music and social coding. My work experience and research interests in Computer Science have a strong emphasis on data science and social network analysis.
