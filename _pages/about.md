Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Jeremy, and I absolutely love to tell stories with data. The beauty of data visualization (and data science) as a whole is that I can tell a story and communicate insights from a dataset.

I am currently an undergraduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am majoring in <a href="http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schools-colleges/dietrichcollegeofhumanitiesandsocialsciences/departmentofstatistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Statistics & Machine Learning</a> with a minor in <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/bs-in-artificial-intelligence/minor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artifical Intelligence</a>, so I am involved in both the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences and School of Computer Science.

During my time on campus, I am involved with the CS and Stats departments as an Teaching Assistant, Research Assistant, and also dorm Resident Advisor. In my spare time, I enjoy playing sports (mostly cycling, badminton, ping-pong, running, and volleybal), travelling, cooking, and spending quality time with friends and family. Also, I happened to grow up in China and do speak Mandarin.

I am always looking for folks who are interested in newly created projects and support on on-going projects. If you have an idea and want to see if Iâ€™d be interested in helping out, please reach out to me!
