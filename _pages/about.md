Currently working as a strategy/modeling/machine learning specialist at [L2F](https://www.l2f.ch){:target="\_blank"}, a new start-up in EPFL's Innovation Park. Previously studied pure mathematics (with a touch of theoretical computer science and self-taught ML). Master thesis in multi-agent learning, will upload soon.

Aiming to do a PhD after some time at L2F, optimally in the intersection of mathematics and CS. I'd like to find a nice area where theoretical/abstract understanding really complements applications in AI. Maybe something like manifold learning? I like everything from geometry and analysis to topology and algebra. Undergrad thesis in number theory btw.

Otherwise I love climbing, dancing, cold showers, trees and music. :)
