I'm an AI research engineer at <a href="https://clova.ai/en/research/research-areas.html">NAVER CLOVA</a>
 and <a href="https://naver-career.gitbook.io/en/teams/clova-cic">NAVER AI LAB</a>.
My broad research interest is developing new machine learning algorithms that represent real-world phenomena.
Currently, I'm researching <strong>representation learning for structured data</strong  > including graph representation learning and large-scale multivariate time-series prediction at NAVER.

[comment]: <> (In particular, I have researched latent variable modeling for temporal / relational data.)

I received my B.S. and M.S. degree in Aerospace Engineering from KAIST in 2017 and 2019, respectively, 
under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v5hGAWMAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Han-Lim Choi</a>.
During my masterâ€™s degree, I researched deep latent variable models for dynamical systems.
