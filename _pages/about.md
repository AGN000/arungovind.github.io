I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at University of Michigan (enrolled in 2018). I am fortunate to work with Professor [Ambuj Tewari](https://ambujtewari.github.io). Before joining University of Michigan, I obtained my B.S. degree in Data Science from Peking University in 2018, where I was advised by Professor [Song Xi Chen](https://www.songxichen.com) on climate change and air pollution.

My current research interests are on the theory of Reinforcement Learning (RL), Transfer Learning and Multitask Learning. I am also interested in a wide range of scientific applications of ML. I work with Professor [Paul Zimmerman](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/zimmerman-lab) on RL application to Chemistry.
