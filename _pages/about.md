*Hi folks!*

My name is Evan Febrianto. I am a tech-addict.

I always thought my dream was to be a scientist for a research company, sipping my tea in the morning, and discover something that can help people to make a better life. I joined my first Physics club when I was 13. One year later, I joined a robotics club because I thought it would be cool. I did assembly my first analog line follower robot in 2009. Then, I realized that robotics took a lot of money, I couldn't afford it. I left my robotics club and focused on my physics club. I continued my Physics journey in high school and got some National achievements. The more I explored Physics, the more I realized that I want to dive into electronics.

I took electrical engineering as my major in university. In the first year, I joined the robotics club again because I wanted to excel in my skills (I got a scholarship so that I could save my money to build the robot haha lol). I also got my first programming course using Pascal. “Hello World” is the common first program for every programmer, so do I. Deeper I go in robotics, I feel like I can change the world by combining my robotics and programming skills.

The spark I was missing ignited the instant I did my very first project in 2015. The goal was to build an aquaponic system using IoT. This project got the 3rd place in an International Event in South Korea. Since then, I can’t get enough. I learned C++, C, Python, and some other programming languages, joined some robotics competitions, and did an internship to get robotics or programming projects.

Robotics, IoT, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision are calling to all my passions. I love integrating software and hardware to create innovative and useful technology. It’s amazing. My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem-solving, and time management. So far I have C, C++, Python, JavaScript, CSS, and Pascal under my belt. I will surely learn more by the time goes.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
