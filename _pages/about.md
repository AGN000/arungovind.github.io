I am a <a href="https://mcds.cs.cmu.edu/" target="_blank"> Masterâ€™s</a> student at 
<a href="https://www.cmu.edu/" target="_blank"> Carnegie Mellon University </a> advised 
by <a href="http://pfliu.com" target="_blank"> Pengfei Liu </a> and 
<a href="http://www.phontron.com/" target="_blank"> Prof. Graham Neubig </a>.
My recent research focus has been in text summarization. Specifically, I'm working on new
summarization models, evaluation metrics and meta-evaluation methods.

Prior to this, I was a research assistant at the Machine and Language 
Learning <a href="http://malllabiisc.github.io/" target="_blank"> (MALL) </a> 
Lab at the Indian Institute of Science <a href="https://www.iisc.ac.in/" target="_blank"> (IISC) </a> 
advised by <a href="http://www.talukdar.net" target="_blank"> Prof. Partha Talukdar</a>.
At IISC, my research broadly focused on construction and usage of Knowledge Graphs. 
I have also looked at Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and ways of improving them.
