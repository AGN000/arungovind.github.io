Welcome to my site! I am currently a post-doctoral researcher studying cancer systems biology at Vanderbilt University in the <a href="https://quarantalab.com/">Quaranta Lab</a>. My work is part of the <a href="https://quantsystemsbc.com/">Quantative Systems Biology Center</a> that combines systems biology with mathematical modeling and data science to solve complex biological problems. I focus on data analysis and computational modeling of phenotypic transitions in Small Cell Lung Cancer. After receiving a B.S. in <a href="https://www.wm.edu/as/physics/">Physics</a> and <a href="https://www.wm.edu/as/mathematics/">Mathematics</a> from The College of William & Mary in 2016, I entered Vanderbilt via their <a href="https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/qcb/">Quantitative and Chemical Biology program</a> and completed my PhD in the Quaranta Lab in March 2022. I consider myself a physicist by training and a data scientist by practice. My research experiences in undergrad, graduate school, and my post-doc allow me to combine these identities to approach complex biological problems through the analysis and modeling of and high-dimensional data.
