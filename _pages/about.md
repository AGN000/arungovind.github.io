Greetings!

My name is Zheyuan (Brian) Zhang (张喆元 in chinese). I am a master student at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) pursuing Robotics MS in the [Robotics Institute](https://robotics.umich.edu/) and Cognitive Science Graduate Certificate in the [Weinberg Institute for Cognitive Science](https://lsa.umich.edu/weinberginstitute). Currently, I am a research assistant at the [Situated Language and Embodied Dialogue (SLED)](https://sled.eecs.umich.edu/) lab, advised by Professor [Joyce Chai](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~chaijy/). Prior to UMich, I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science (B.S.) from [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), [College of Information & Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/).

My research interests are centered at the nexus of artificial intelligence and cognitive science, driven by a desire to understand the intricacies of the brain and how can we learn so fast and so much from so little. Specifically, I am interested in deep learning, natural language processing, multimodal learning, continual/online/few-shot learning, robotics and embodied intelligence, cognitive science with following themes:
- Deep Learning: biologically-inspired neural architectures and learning algorithms (especially for aspects: "continual", "online" and "few-shot"), compositionality
- Natural Language Processing: human-like reasoning and planning, language grounding to vision and robotics, language acquisition and emergence
- Robotics and Embodied Intelligence: manipulation, navigation, interactions (multi-agent interaction and human-robot interaction)
- Cognitive Science: cognitive psychology, neuroscience
