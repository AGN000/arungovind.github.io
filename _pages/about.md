Hi, I’m Abhishek Pandey, a mechanical design engineer with a passion for turning ideas into functional, optimized, and efficient designs. Whether it’s ensuring every bolt is in the right place or engineering a smooth gear shift, I thrive on solving complex design challenges with precision and creativity. I believe in building not just strong structures but also strong connections. Let’s gear up to make this world a better place, one innovative solution at a time!

Feel free to explore my work, and I’d love to hear your feedback or thoughts. Don’t hesitate to reach out to me on LinkedIn or other platforms for collaboration opportunities. Whether it’s to share insights, discuss engineering marvels, or just exchange some light-hearted engineering puns, I’m all in! Let’s connect and grow together!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
