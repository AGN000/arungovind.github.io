I am Dhawal, I am a Masters student at [IIIT-Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/). I am associated with [CVIT](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) working with Prof. [P.J. Narayanan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3HKjt_IAAAAJ). I am currently working on Real-time Photorealistic Rendering.

I am very much interested in [Light-fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_field#:~:text=The%20light%20field%20is%20a,is%20given%20by%20its%20radiance.) and [PBR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_based_rendering). My current work is centered around Spherical harmonic representation of Lighting and Visibility Information advancing the works of Precomputed Radiance Transfer.

Please find my [cv](/assets/pdf/dhawal1939_cv.pdf) for further details.
