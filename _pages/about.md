I am a Research Scientist in, the group of Prof. [Philipp Grohs](https://mds.univie.ac.at/people/univ-prof-dr-philipp-grohs/), Mathematical Data Science at Radon Institute for Computational and Applied Mathematics ([RICAM](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/ricam/)) which is part of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (Austria).

I received my Ph.D. degree in Pure and Applied Mathematics from the University of Turin (Italy) in March 2019 within the joint program between Polytechnic and University of Turin, where I was advised by Prof. [Sandro Coriasco](https://www.matematica.unito.it/do/docenti.pl/Alias?sandro.coriasco). During my Ph.D., I had long research visits to Prof. [Joachim Toft](https://lnu.se/en/staff/joachim.toft) at Linnaeus University (Sweden) during 2017 and 2018.

My interests lie in the study of mathematical foundations of machine learning. In particular I am interested in theoretical understanding of the approximation and representation capabilities of deep and shallow neural networks. Furthermore, I am interested in time-frequency analysis, generalized functions and micro-local analysis.
