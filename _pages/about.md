I am a 5th year PhD student at UIUC in the Scientific Computing group, working with [Luke Olson](https://lukeo.cs.illinois.edu/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of applied mathematics, high performance computing and physics/engineering applications. 
My current work involves developing numerical solvers for (non)linear PDE systems resulting from coupled physics and engineering applications. This includes the design of scalable parallel solvers based on monolithic multigrid preconditioners. 

Please see my [CV](https://alexey-voronin.github.io/assets/pdf/alexey-voronin-cv.pdf) for more information.
