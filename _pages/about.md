My name is Friedhelm Victor (Friedhelm is the first name :smirk:) and I'm a PhD candidate at TU Berlin, researching primarily on the intersections of blockchain, data science and privacy. Most of my works involve blockchain-based cryptoassets and the Ethereum network.

More generally, I'm interested in:
- Data Mining
- Network Analysis
- Privacy & Anonymity
- Fraud Detection

Prior to pursuing a PhD, I've completed a Dual Master Degree in Computer Science at [Technische Universit√§t Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/) and at the [Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/).
