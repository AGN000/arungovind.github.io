I'm currently a visiting student at [Sailing-MBZUAI Lab](https://sailing-mbzuai.github.io/) working with [Prof. Eric Xing](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/). 
I'm broadly interested in machine learning and deep learning, striking a balance between theoretical understanding and practical application to address large-scale real-world challenges. 
My first-author publications include federated optimization, Bayesian neural networks, reinforcement learning theory, sparse training, certified robustness, vision transformers, and self-supervised learning, etc. My most recent research experiences and interests lie in every aspect of large language models, including pre-training, fin-tuning, and inference.


Before this, I completed my master's degree in computer science at UC Santa Cruz in June 2023, focusing on machine learning and computer vision. In 2023, I also collaborated with Prof. [Ruqi Zhang](https://ruqizhang.github.io/) on efficient training of Bayesian neural networks.
Earlier, I got my bachelor's degree in mathematics and applied mathematics at Fudan University in June 2021. During which, I worked on reinforcement learning theory with Prof. [Zhaoran Wang](https://zhaoranwang.github.io/) and [Zhuoran Yang](https://zhuoranyang.github.io/).
