Despite having a Master of Public Policy from [KDI School of Public Policy and Management](http://kdischool.ac.kr), South Korea, my other academic qualifications include Master of Public Administration, Master of Management Sciences from [COMSATS University Islamabad](http://attock.comsats.edu.pk), Pakistan and Euro – Asia Summer School – Exchange Program from [KU Leuven](https://ghum.kuleuven.be/ggs/research/euro_asia_summerschool/summer-school-2021), Belgium. I studied a number of relevant courses my time being in education such as Econometrics I, Econometrics II, Impact Evaluation Methods, Statistical Inferences, Development Economics and Public Policy & Governance. In addition to that I took part in Stata, R & MS-Excel workshops for data analysis.
My professional experience includes 5-Year as Head of Accounts Department at [Cadet College Hasanabdal](http://cch.edu.pk) where I work on various data analysis tools to identify the patterns, risks, & impact related to financial activities. I worked 1-Year as Research Associate in the Joint Project of KDI School and COMSATS University Islamabad titled “Impact Evaluation of Punjab Land Record Management Information System” funded by KDI School. My master theses were also centered on impact evaluation study titled “Impact Evaluation of Vocational Training Institutes in Punjab province, Pakistan” and “Impact of Conservational Activities on Green Performance”. I exploit impact evaluation techniques such as Instrumental Variable Aproach, Difference-in-Difference and Regression Discontinuity Design in Stata-17 to evalaute the causal relationship.
