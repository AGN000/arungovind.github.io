I'm a Venezuelan physicist, AI & trading enthusiast. I was born in Maracaibo in 1996, however I grew up in Valera,Trujillo and I'm proud to call myself "Gocho". I was a scout for about 11 years, and it shaped the person I am today, I believe I am a better person because of all the experiences and people I met in the movement over the years.

I started off as an electronics engineer mainly due to the Venezuelan crisis affecting universities, I later did a masters in experimental quantum optics, and now I'm pursuing a PhD in open quantum systems at ICTQT under the supervision of Michal Horodecki, I was previously an Intern at RIKEN  where I worked on enhancements on the qutip HEOM package, that started me off contributing to open source which I actively try to do.

In my free time I enjoy anime, cooking and video games, as well as trading, while I mainly avoid as my saving as to be invested long term there's something deeply interesting about the markets, and trading small amounts can be quite entretaining.
