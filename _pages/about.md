This is Jafet Baca, an Economics enthusiast from Nicaragua. I graduated *Magna Cum Laude* from Universidad Centroamericana (UCA) in April 2021 with a Bachelor's Degree in Applied Economics.

I am a first year Ph.D. student in Economics at Emory University. My current academic interests are Macroeconomics and International Economics.
