Hello world, I am Geosciences graduate student at Brown University. I am geoAI enthusiast. I use different geospatial datasets to study and analyze the changes in landcover/use, hydrology, vegetation dynamics. I have used computer vision and deep learning techniques for pattern recognition and object detection in satellite imagery.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
