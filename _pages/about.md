I am a PhD student at <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://www.imtlucca.it/en" target="_blank">IMT Lucca</a> in the <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://dysco.imtlucca.it/" target="_blank">Dynamical Systems, Control, and Optimization (DYSCO)</a> research group under the supervision of Professor <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://cse.lab.imtlucca.it/~bemporad/" target="_blank">Alberto Bemporad</a>. My research interests cover various topics in **applied mathematics**. Currently, I am working on **second-order (numerical) optimization** methods for training **(recurrent) neural networks** with applications in identification and control of dynamical systems.
