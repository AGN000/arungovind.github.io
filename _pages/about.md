Hi! My name is Simon. I am a graduate student at MIT working with Boris Kozinsky at Harvard. 
I am broadly interested in advancing science using ideas the revolve around statistical inference, learning, and computing.

Prior to joining Harvard, I worked on a variety of problems in Machine Learning with Alexie Kolpak at MIT. I also spent a year working on the NASA mission SOFIA. 
In my free time, I enjoy the mountains, hiking, and listening to the beautiful sounds of the Foo Fighters. I'm always happy to talk about maths, statisticis, and machine learning. Feel free to reach out!
