I am an Economics enthusiast from Nicaragua. Macroeconomics, International Economics and Monetary Economics are my current academic and professional interests.

Prior to attending Universidad Centroamericana (UCA), I participated in several mathematical olympiads, most notably, the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) and the Iberoamerican Mathematical Olympiad (IbMO). I graduated *magna cum laude* from UCA in April 2021 with a Bachelor's Degree in Applied Economics.

I will join the Economics Department of Emory University as a Ph.D. student in Fall 2022.
