Hey there! I'm a PhD student in Linguistics at Carleton University with a background in Computational Linguistics and Computer Science. My passion lies in computational semantics, which is all about how machines can learn the meaning of language like humans do.

I'm especially intrigued by natural language reasoning and how machines, like large language models, handle it. It's fascinating to explore the connection between this and the fact that these machines sometimes give us incorrect information. Meaning itself is quite controversial among us humansâ€”we can be sarcastic, tell lies, and spread misinformation. I find it funny that even humans struggle to understand language sometimes, so the idea of machines deciphering meaning is quite mind-boggling. Will machines ever understand meaning better than us? Let's embark on this academic yet entertaining journey together!
