Throughout my career, I have worked with geologists, geophysicists, geomorphologists, hydrologists, and other specialists to explore the complex connections between different disciplines in geodata science. Even though I am still none of them ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 

As ~~a full stack geospatial professional~~ with a diverse range of skills, I experienced a fantastic journey to [explore various disciplines](https://geo.w.uib.no/files/2020/01/Poster-The-Geological-Society-Geoscience-for-the-future-scaled.jpg), from discovering oil and gas to carbon capture and storage, from glacial mass balance to hydrological model, from examining [the origin of landforms](https://zhihaol.eu.org/blog/2022/Quaternary-geomorphology-of-Norway/) to predicting [permafrost changes at 2100](https://zhihaol.eu.org/blog/2022/permafrost-extent/).
