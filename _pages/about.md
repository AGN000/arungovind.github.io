Hi! This is a TechBlog of Gezi, who is pursuing a Ph.D. in Genetics from Yale University.

Here I will post my study notes constantly (I hope so). The main purpose of this blog is to make it easier for my lab-mates and collaborators to check at anytime. Anyone interested is also welcome! If you have any questions, please reach me at geziw81889@gmail.com.

Let us make progress together.
