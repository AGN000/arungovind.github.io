Hello! My name is Andrew Rodriguez. I am a master's student at The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) studying computer science. My research interests include complexity, game theory, and natural computing: computation inspired by nature or natural systems. I have looked at problems relating to self-assembly and evolutionary algorithms. I research with the Algorithmic Self-Assembly Research Group (ASARG) here on campus.

Previously, I attended The University of Texas at Austin and received my bachelor's in computer science.
