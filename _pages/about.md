I'm an epidemiologist by training with interests in causal inference, machine learning, complex data fusion problems. I obtained my PhD in Epidemiology with Dr. [Ashley Naimi](https://sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/index.php?FID=ashley-naimi-11502) at the University of Pittsburgh, and was a Postdoctoral Fellow with Drs. [Bryan Lau](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/1592/bryan-lau) and [Elizabeth Stuart](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/1792/elizabeth-a-stuart) at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Currently, I'm a Senior Biostatistician at GRAIL, LLC.
