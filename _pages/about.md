 <a href='#'><b>About Me</b></a>

 I currently work as a data analyst that specializes in marketing analytics in the automotive industry.

 I am experienced in data analysis, machine learning and data visualization. The main tools I use are <a href='#'>SQL, Python, Power BI</a> and <a href='#'>Tableau</a>.

 Besides data science, I also love golfing and bodybuilding. So if you ever want to bounce ideas off me, please feel free to [contact me](shainalolin@gmail.com).
