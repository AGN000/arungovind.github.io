Hi, I love computer science! I am a graduate student at The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley completing my masterâ€™s degree. I research with the Algorithmic Self-Assembly Research Group (ASARG) here on campus. Previously, I attended The University of Texas at Austin and received a B.S. in Computer Science.
