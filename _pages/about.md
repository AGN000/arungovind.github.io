i'm a final year phd candidate in management at mit sloan.

my work investigates and improves core business strategies such as pricing, targeting, and recommendations in online marketplaces. methodologically, I fuse machine learning and causal inference tools to evaluate and optimize both personalized and system-wide policies. i especially focus on scalable models, a critical aspect of applied work that is currently untapped in quantitative social science research.

at mit, i am fortunate to work under the supervision of prof. sinan aral, prof. dean eckles, and prof. john hauser.

in my past life, i was a management consultant and a researcher at the reserve bank of india. i have a bachelors (honors) in physics and a masters in economics. 

i love corgis, small confidence intervals, and long aimless walks.
