Welcome to my website! You will find here a description of my projects and research activities.

I am a research associate in the department of mechanical Engineering at the university of Sheffield. My main research interests include the mathematical and numerical analysis of waves propagation in heterogeneous media.

I started my career working on inverse scattering problems and more recently homogeneisation in random media.
