I am a fifth year graduate student at the University of Pittsburgh in [Prof. Andrew Mugler's group](https://mugler.pitt.edu) where I study the physics of cell signaling and migration from a theoretical perspective. In particular, I use tools from statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, partial differential equations, complex analysis, numerical analysis, linear algebra, and fluid dynamics to probe the ways cells exploit and probe their immediate microenvironment to perform taxis. My work has direct implications in the study of cancer, of which tumor cells often serve as the experimental platform in my work, and as such one can say I study the physics of metastatic invasion. 

For more context on my research along with future projects that are currently being planned on, please visit the <b>publications</b> tab above.

In my personal time, I like to write, draw, paint, surf, and travel. I hope to publish short stories one day.
