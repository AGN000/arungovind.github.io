Hi! I am a data professional with 3+ years of experience, interested in working in the interesection of tech and social impact. I currently work as a Data Analytics Freelancer at [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0162236444b2794456?viewMode=1). 

Recently I graduated with distinction in MSc Data Analytics from the University of Strathclyde, where I honed my skills across machine learning, data warehousing, and programming languages like Python and R. My previous degree in Msc Quantitative Economics program from the University of Tartu equipped me with a strong foundation in statistical and econometric analysis. My strong background in research, experience with a wide variety of data munging tools such as Python, R, Stata used in wide range of industries, and as BI tools such as PowerBI, Tableau and Excel, as well as the ability to effectively communicate insights to stakeholders, places me well for Data Analyst/Insight Analyst/ Business Analyst roles.

My current area of interest is geospatial analysis and footfall traffic analysis for formulating effective strategy for media campaign companies. In this pursuit of my interest, one of my most recent pitches to a client had to make sense of a very sparsely colleced media data by the client over 2 years to inform their investment portfolio for the next year. Thus I analyzed footfall data against the basket of media investments made by the client to analyze the [effect of various digital media campaigns](https://github.com/detectorisk/Digital_media_affect_on_footfall/tree/main) to bring people to their physical stores.

[subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
