I am an Applied Economist from Universidad Centroamericana (UCA), Nicaragua. So far, my research experience has comprised international economics and development economics. Macroeconomics, monetary economics, public policy and data science are also part of my academic and professional interests.

Before entering UCA, I had participated in several mathematical olympiads, most notably, the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) and the Iberoamerican Mathematical Olympiad. On account of my performance in these competitions, UNO Foundation awarded me an Academic Excellence Scholarship for Undegraduate Studies. I am still actively involved in olympiad activities as an Euclidean Geometry instructor at Academia Sabatina de JÃ³venes Talento (ASJTNIC), Nicaragua.

I engaged in research contests during higher education, such as the 17th Symposium for Young Researchers, organized by UCA, and the 2020 Economics, Finance, and Development Award, carried out by the Central Bank of Nicaragua. Last but not least, I also collaborated as an assistant student for two undergraduate courses, namely, Intermediate Macroeconomics 20201S and Time Series Econometrics 20202S.

Presently, I am looking forward to pursuing graduate studies in Economics.
