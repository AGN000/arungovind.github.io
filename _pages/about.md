I am a current [BUILD Dairy](https://builddairy.com/) third-year Ph.D. student in Data Science at Boise State University, with a keen focus on developing cutting-edge chemometric software for the analysis of milk samples. Prior to my doctoral studies, I received a fully-funded scholarship from the UK government to pursue an M.Sc. in FinTech at the University of Stirling. During my master's program, I honed my skills in developing mobile financial applications using open banking APIs, and the TrueLayer API.

My research interests span a diverse range of fields, including Generative AI, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Engineering. I am driven by a passion for leveraging advanced data science techniques to unlock valuable insights and develop innovative solutions.
