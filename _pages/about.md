Hey, my name is Morris Huang (黃禹超 in Chinese).I am currently pursuing my Master's in Physics under the guidance of <a href='https://www.phys.ntu.edu.tw/enphysics/goan.html'>Prof. Hsi-Sheng Goan</a> at <a href='https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/'>National Taiwan University</a>. My research interest lies in the intersection of physics and computation.

I have experience in parallel computing, machine learning, particle-in-cell simulation, , and molecular dynamics.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
