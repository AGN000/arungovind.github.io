I am a third-year Ph.D. student at Northeastern University in Boston. My research focuses on data privacy. I investigate how various online platforms, including websites, comply with emerging privacy laws like such as CCPA.

As a researcher, I am passionate about understanding the intricate mechanisms that govern the online ecosystem and finding ways to improve security and privacy for users. My work involves analyzing various algorithms and technologies used by online platforms to identify potential vulnerabilities and recommend best practices for compliance with regulatory frameworks.


<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
