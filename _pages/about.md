I am currently completing my Ph.D. in development and health economics at [LEDa](https://leda.dauphine.fr/) Université Paris-Dauphine, PSL. My research in applied microeconomics focuses on the **health and human capital effects of environmental shocks**, including weather events and water pollution. I am particularly interested in georeferenced data. My thesis is under the supervision of Eric Bonsang and Clémentine Garrouste.

In my Job Market Paper, I investigate the long-term consequences of early-life weather shocks, considering both precipitation and temperature, on long-term cognitive functions in China. The studied sample includes individuals born from 1917 to 1973. Thanks to historical agricultural data, I am able to isolate the agricultural pathway from other channels.
