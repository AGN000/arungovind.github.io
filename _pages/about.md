Welcome to my site! 

<p align="justify">
I am a PhD student in Economics at Indiana University, Bloomington. My research interests focus on macroeconomics with emphasis on household finance, financial markets and quantitative methods. Throughout my work, I study the interaction of micro-level heterogeneity, idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks and economic policy.
