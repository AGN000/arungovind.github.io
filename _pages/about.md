Hi there! I'm Chinmaya Kausik, a rising 2nd year mathematics Ph.D. student at UMich working on sequential decision making, statistics, optimization and machine learning. I am being co-advised by [Prof. Ambuj Tewari](https://ambujtewari.github.io/) and [Prof. Martin Strauss](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~martinjs/).

A lot of my undergraduate background is in geometry, topology and dynamics with work in computer-assisted topology and geometry. Check out my [projects](projects and engagements) (along with post-mortems) and [interests](more)!

**What do I care about, broadly?** 
* Mathematical problems motivated by tangible, real-world questions. 
* Increasing accessibility to and in higher mathematics and creating communities where ideas cross pollinate and people pull each other up[^1].

[^1]: This is part of why I co-founded and co-organize [Monsoon Math Camp](https://www.monsoonmath.org) - an online math camp for promising high school students introducing them to advanced undergraduate and graduate-level math. You should check it out! I have also been involved in building and expanding other mathematical communities, like platforms for the PolyMath REU, DRP programs and the undergraduate math organization at IISc, etc.
