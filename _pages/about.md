I am a cognitive neuroscientist interested in brain processes underlying cognition and how non-invasive brain stimulation can be used to manipulate this. In my research I combine behavioral measures with neuroscientific methods like electroencephalography (EEG), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).

After a bachelor's in Psychology at Leiden University and a research master's in Cognitive Neuropsychology at VU Amsterdam, I started my PhD in 2015 at the Donders Institute. With Dennis Schutter, Sander Daselaar, Marc Hendriks, and Roy Kessels, I did research on the role of the parietal cortex in memory confidence, using EEG, TMS and tACS (<a href="https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/216190/216190.pdf">Dissertation</a>). During my time at the Donders Institute, I also collaborated on projects that focused on attention, decision making and movement, using EEG, TMS and tDCS. Thereafter, I worked as a postdoctoral research associate at Bowdoin College with Erika Nyhus. My work here focused on the role of specific oscillications in brain networks underlying memory retrieval, utilizing EEG and tACS. Currently, I work at the University of Birmingham in Ole Jensen's Neural Oscillations group examining the role of alpha oscillations in visual processing.
