Hey! I'm Brian, a Form 5 student at La Salle College. My aspiration is to become a neuroscientist; I'm broadly interested in computational neuroscience and neurology.

Outside neuroscience, I have an eclectic mix of interests ranging from programming to calligraphy. Check them out in the `interests` tab!
