After many years sitting with *meteorologist, geomorphologist, hydrologist, glaciologist, sedimentologist, geodesist, geologist, geophysicist*, **I am still none of them** ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. But It's still a fantastic journey to [explore multidiscipline as a geodataer](https://geo.w.uib.no/files/2020/01/Poster-The-Geological-Society-Geoscience-for-the-future-scaled.jpg), from discovering oil and gas to carbon capture and storage, from glacial mass balance to hydrological model, from [the origin of landforms](https://zhihaol.eu.org/blog/2022/Quaternary-geomorphology-of-Norway/) to [permafrost projection at 2100](https://zhihaol.eu.org/blog/2022/permafrost-extent/).
