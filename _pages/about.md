I am a first year PhD student at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) in the [Oden Institute](https://oden.utexas.edu/) where I am extremely fortunate to be co-advised by [Atlas Wang](https://vita-group.github.io/) and [William Gilpin](http://www.wgilpin.com/). I am broadly interested in the intersection of machine learning (ML) and physics. I did my undergraduate studies at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) where I studied physics, computer science, and mathematics.

In my free time, I love to be outdoors in the heat or the cold. However, I prefer the cold because skiing is my favorite activity, by far. I also play soccer and I am a lifelong fan of Manchester United.
