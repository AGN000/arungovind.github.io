I am a [incoming] PhD student in economics at Boston University. My research interests are economic history, political economy and development economics. I'm interested in applying machine learning and text analysis methods. I hold a BSc and MA in economics from Universidad de los Andes. I previously 
worked as a predoctoral fellow at <a href="https://econ.columbia.edu/per/">PER</a>.

 I'm a lab manager at <a href="https://www.industrialpolicygroup.com">The Industrial Policy Group</a>, an empirical research lab that aims to deliver core empirical research surrounding industrial policy, and make industrial policy a serious object of economic study.
