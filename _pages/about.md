A `spatial professional` can do everything but end up doing nothing üíä. 

*Meteorologist, geomorphologist, hydrologist, glaciologist, sedimentologist, geodesist, geologist, geophysicist,* after sitting with them so many years, **I am none of them** ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 

But, it's a fantastic journey to explore multidiscipline. 
- Geomorphology = terrain process (glacial, periglacial, tectonic, fluvial, geotechnical process) + context (geology, paleoclimatology) + data (remote sensing, geophysics)
- Hydrology = water process (precipitation, accumulation, runoff, groundwater, evaporation) + context (energy balance, environment, climate) + data (remote sensing, geophysics)

Remote sensing/geomatics/GIS is the data science of geoscience.
