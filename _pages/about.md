I am currently an Associate Professor of the [School of Electronic and Information](http://eis.whu.edu.cn/) at **[Wuhan University](http://www.whu.edu.cn/)** and leading a group [DVS-WHU](members/) in the [SPLab](http://dsp.whu.edu.cn/) which is devoted for [event-based perception](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/event-based_vision_resources). In general my research interest includes signal processing, deep learning and computer vision. Specifically, I am currently interested in:
  
* Sparse Signal Recovery
* Neuromorphic Computation 
* Event-based Image Enhancement and Visual Perception 

Previously, I received the Bachelor and PhD degrees in Signal and Information Processing in 2006 and 2012, respectively, both from [Wuhan University](http://www.whu.edu.cn/). I also got a PhD degree in Automatic Control from [ENSEA](http://www.ensea.fr/)/[Université de Cergy-Pontoise](http://www.u-cergy.fr/index.php), Cergy, France, in November 2011. From December 2011 to March 2013, I held a Postdoctoral position in [Empenn](https://team.inria.fr/empenn/team-members/team-alumni/) (former name: ViSaGe), working with [Prof. Rémi Gribonval](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/remi.gribonval/) and [Prof. Christian Barillot](http://people.irisa.fr/Christian.Barillot/). From March 2016 to March 2017, I was working at [Duke University](http://http://www.duke.edu/) as a visiting scholar.
