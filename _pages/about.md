I am Qiuyang Mang (忙秋阳 in Chinese), a third-year undergraduate at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, under the guidance of Prof. [Pinjia He](https://pinjiahe.github.io/). I am currently interning at [Trustworthy Engineering of Software Technologies (TEST) Lab](https://nus-test.github.io/), advised by Prof. [Manuel Rigger](https://www.manuelrigger.at/). 

My focus lies in AI Robustness (*e.g.,* developing automated tools for testing and improvement the AI software),  testing traditional systems (*e.g.,* databases and compilers), and graph algorithms.
