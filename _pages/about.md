I am a second-year MSc student majoring in **electrical and systems engineering** at the University of Pennsylvania. My interest mainly lies at the intersection of **optimization**, **learning**, and **control** in **robotic manipulation** and **legged locomotion**. I am also happy to work on AI in gaming and general automation challenges. 

I am currently working at [KOD*LAB](https://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/) advised by Prof. [Daniel E. Koditschek](https://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/kod/) and mentored by [J. Diego Caporale](https://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/group/jdiegocaporale/). Before joining Upenn, I spent roughly three years working and learning at [Robotics & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://rail.cuhk.edu.cn/people) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen under the supervision of Prof. [Huihuan Qian](https://rail.cuhk.edu.cn/people/263).

In my spare time, I enjoy doing almost all kinds of sports, including soccer, basketball, badminton, etc. I am also doing amateur boxing training at [James Shuler Boxing Gym](https://www.jamesshulerboxing.com/).
