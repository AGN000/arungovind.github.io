Hey there - finally, you found me here. This is my little space in the world wide web where I post stuff about myself. Most probably seldom and in no special categories. 

I was born in July 1970 and did a lot of things in my life. As a landscaper, as a musician, as a daddy, as a software developer, as a book author, as a team-lead and as a manager. You will find more about these
facts in various pages here.

If you want to get in touch with me, write me an <a href="mailto:post@andy-wenk.de">email</a>
