I'm a research scientist at <a href="https://clova.ai/en/research/research-areas.html">NAVER CLOVA</a>
 and <a href="https://naver-career.gitbook.io/en/teams/clova-cic">NAVER AI LAB</a>.
My current research interest include a relational representation learning with graph neural network 
and a large-scale multivariate time-series forecasting.

I received my B.S. and M.S. degree in Aerospace Engineering from KAIST in 2017 and 2019, respectively, 
under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v5hGAWMAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Han-Lim Choi</a>.
During my masterâ€™s degree, I researched deep latent variable models for dynamical systems.
