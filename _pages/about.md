Hi! I am Qingqin Liu (刘晴钦 in Chinese). I am a PhD student of the <a href='https://meilab-hk.github.io/index.html'>MEI Lab</a> at City University of Hong Kong, mentored by <a href='https://zhukening.wixsite.com/aboutme'>Prof. Kening Zhu</a>. I received my Master's degree in Communication from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), advised by <a href='https://dblp.org/pid/117/0075-1.html'>Prof. Yanxiang Zhang</a>. Prior to that, I completed a Bachelor of Science in Astronomy at USTC.

I am interested in enabling human-computer interactions using different modalities(touch, gestures, haptics, gaze, etc.), and on different devices (hand-held, head-mounted, in midair, esp. VR/AR/MR). Also, I am interested in game interaction and playable interfaces, game design and development, and player experience evaluation.
