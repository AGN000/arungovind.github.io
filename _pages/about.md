I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Strategy & Entrepreneurship at the [Norwegian Business School (BI)](https://www.bi.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. My teaching is focused on statistical courses such as machine learning and econometrics, and on technological innovations and entrepreneurial finance.

So far results of my research have been published in [Entrepreneurship, Theory and Practice](https://doi.org/10.1177/1042258720958020) and [Small Business Economics](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11187-019-00309-8). You can find my publications [here](/al-folio/publications/) or on [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Pn3NdMgAAAAJ&hl=en)

# Research interests
My research lies at the intersections of innovation, entrepreneurship and finance, particularly on firm life-cycle factors affecting financing and growth, and how institutional failures and transformations lead to technological change. I am interested in how exogenous shocks - esp. technological, environmental and economic - affect entrepreneurs’ and funders’ decision-making and the economic consequences of their decisions.

My primary research topics are social and corporate entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial finance, digital innovations, and more efficient organization and financing of innovation and R&D in firms.
