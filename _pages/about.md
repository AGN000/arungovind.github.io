Hi! I am a Ph.D. student at Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at University of Pittsburgh, working 
under supervision of [Prof. Heng Huang](https://sites.pitt.edu/~heh45/). My research interest is to make deep neural networks
efficient and deployable in real-world applications. I am also interested in generative modeling and automated medical image analysis.  

Previously I get my Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) from University of Tehran, working with [Dr. Reshad Hosseini](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~reshad.hosseini)
on 3D Reconstruction of symmetric structures.
