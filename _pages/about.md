I am a fourth year PhD student in the [Department of Statistical Science at Duke University](http://stat.duke.edu) working with [Peter Hoff](http://pdhoff.github.io).

Prior to coming to Duke, I worked on macroeconomic theory research with The Macroeconomic and Quantitative Studies group at [The Federal Reserve Board](http://federalreserve.gov).

<h3> Research Interests </h3>

Broadly, I develop methodology that improves inferential precision in analyses with data obtained from multiple groups or sources. I am particularly interested in developing straightforward methods that are robust to mis-specification without sacrificing usefulness. My recent work is related to covariance estimation, small area estimation, and conformal prediction.
