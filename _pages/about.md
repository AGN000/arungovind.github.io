Hi! Welcome to my website, where I have tried to put my analytics journey in perspective. I am a data professional with 5+ years of experience, interested in working in the interesection of tech and social impact. I currently work as a Data Analytics Freelancer at [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0162236444b2794456?viewMode=1). 

My most recent work was to make sense of sparsely colleced media data by the client over 2 years to inform their investment portfolio for the next year. Overcoming this challenge of inadequate data, I was able to analyze [footfall data against the basket of digital media investments](https://github.com/detectorisk/Digital_media_affect_on_footfall/tree/main) made by the client to inform next year's investment portfolio. 

Recently I graduated with distinction in MSc Data Analytics from the University of Strathclyde, where I honed my skills across advanced machine learning tools, data warehousing, and upskiller by programming proficiency in Python, R, SQL, PowerBI etc. My strong background in research, experience with a wide variety of data munging tools, as well as the ability to effectively communicate insights to stakeholders, places me well for Data Analyst/Insight Analyst/ Business Analyst roles.

[subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
