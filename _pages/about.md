Greetings and welcome to my webpage !

As an Mtech student specializing in Communication and Signal Processing at IIT Bombay, I work in the field of cryptography and blockchains with [Prof. Saravanan Vijayakumaran](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sarva/). Through my blog, I hope to share my insights and engage with others who share my interests.

Please feel free to reach out to me via email to discuss these topics further, ask questions, or simply connect. Thank you for visiting !

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
