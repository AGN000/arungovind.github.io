Hi! I’m an incoming PhD student in Information Science at Cornell, where I'll be studying algorithmic fairness under the supervision of Allison Koenecke and Rene Kizilcec. I'm currently working as a research assistant on the "Expanding AI Audits" team at NYU, and have collaborated on research with the Algorithmic Justice League and the Compliant and Accountable Systems lab at the University of Cambridge.

Previously, I worked as a data scientist in Deloitte's AI & Advanced Analytics group, where I focused primarily on advancing health equity through algorithm auditing. Prior to that, I double-majored in Computer Science and Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at the University of Pennsylvania, where I graduated summa cum laude.

In my free time, I’m on a multi-boro quest to identify the best pizza in New York (recommendations welcome!).
