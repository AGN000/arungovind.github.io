I am a $2^{nd}$ year Master's student at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Dharwad. I am currently researching on "Age of Information in wireless communication networks" with Asst. Prof. Rajshekhar V Bhat.

My current research interests are in Wireless Communication, Optimization, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning.
