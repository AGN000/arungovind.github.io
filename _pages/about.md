Greetings!

My name is Zheyuan Zhang(chinese: 张喆元). You can call me Brian which is my English Name chosen by myself. I am an undergraduate student at [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/). View my latest CV [here](assets/pdf/cv.pdf).

My research interests are artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics. I am particularly interested in exploring how the brain works and how we understand the world. My goal is to build robots with high-level intelligence to have similar thinking processes like humans and other animals, including perception, learning, decision-making and emotions.

In my spare time, I love playing computer games and watching movies and TV-series. I also like lifting weights to train my physique(bodybuilding).
