Hi, I'm Meilina 👋🏼 I'm currently an MSc student in Data Science in Engineering at the 
Eindhoven University of Technology. Pleasure to e-meet you! I'm an highly motivated 
and enthousiastic student seeking novel solutions on the social, ethical and technological playing field 
of responsible data science and explainable AI. From a young age, I've always had the desire to contribute 
to the greater good, and I aspire to carry this with me in my future endeavours. 

📚 Coming year, I'll be following my electives in the domain of automated machine learning and quantum algorithms at 
Leiden University. Leveraging the power of artificial intelligence in the field of quantum computing has an incredible 
potential to challenge the status quo and reinvent how we tackle global, societal challenges. Tremendous challenges 
involving a lot of real-world impact, such as drug discovery and the treatment of clinical diseases. 
With this knowledge, I hope to contribute to the knowledge economy to apply artificial intelligence for the greater good.

👩‍💻 Next to my studies, I'm working part-time as a Graduate Teaching Assistant and Junior Researcher at Utrecht University.
I assist with teaching courses in the Applied Data Science master and assist with research 
projects of the Utrecht Data School. The projects are mainly centred around the ethics of artificial intelligence and 
the use of responsible data science.

📩 I'm always open to exchange thoughts, whether it's on finding the best coffee in Eindhoven or on something you 
would like to share -- I'm always eager to listen! Do not hesitate to drop me a line (or any other geometric shape), 
I don't byte! :)
