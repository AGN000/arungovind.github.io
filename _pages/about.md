I am a first year PhD student at [CERMICS](https://cermics-lab.enpc.fr/) under the supervision of [Axel Parmentier](https://cermics.enpc.fr/~parmenta/), in collaboration with Air France.

The objective of my thesis is to apply methods at the frontier of **Operations Research** and **Machine Learning** to propose efficient algorithms for the aircraft routing and crew pairing problem, taking into account uncertainties such as delay propagation.
