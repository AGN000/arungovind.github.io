Hi there! I am a fourth year Neuroscience PhD candidate at Yale University. I am conducting my thesis work in [Dr. Alex Kwan's lab](http://alexkwanlab.org) (recently relocated to Cornell University Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering) and my research interests encompass neuropsychiatric disorders and molecular psychiatry.
