Meet Dwiki Kusuma, the intrepid explorer of the digital realm, whose heart belongs to the art of application security. Starting as a security consultant in the captivating world of Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC), Dwiki soon found himself drawn deeper into the thrilling landscapes of offensive security. Today, he stands proudly as an application security specialist, arming systems against threats and fortifying digital fortresses.

As the sun rises, Dwiki dons his digital armor, ready to face the challenges of appsec with unwavering determination. But when night falls, a different side emerges – a shadowy figure, lurking in the depths of bug bounty hunting, seeking out vulnerabilities like a treasure hunter of the virtual realm.

During his nocturnal escapades, Dwiki ceaselessly explores the wisdom shared by his security comrades – whether it's public conference YouTube videos, intriguing papers, or illuminating blogs. Always ready to learn, he embraces new tools and methodologies with the ardor of a kid in a candy store.
