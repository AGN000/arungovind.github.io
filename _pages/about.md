Hi There!
\\
\\
I am Pranav, currently pursuing my integrated Bachelors and Masters of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/). For the past few years I have been working in Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval with my interests aliging with knowledge-driven AI, low resource NLP and training-parameter efficient transfer learning. 
\\
\\
I have previously worked on machine commonsene, summarization and low-resouece NLP at the [NLPRL](https://github.com/NLPRL), [IIT (BHU) Varanasi](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/). Currently, at the [Language Technologies group](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/home.html), [University of Hamburg](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/) I am working on analyzing the effect of output vocabulary token length for SPARQL semantic parsing with prompt tuning and finetuning. Previously I have worked here on end-to-end KGQA and knowledge graphs.
\\
Also, I am working on zero-shot abstractive summarization with prompt tuning at the [IR Lab](https://cse-iitbhu.github.io/irlab/index.html), [IIT (BHU) Varanasi](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/).
