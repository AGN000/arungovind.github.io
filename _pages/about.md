Hi! I'm Miles, a PhD student studying experimental, high energy, particle, physics. I'm interested in all things physics, in particular computational and mathematical physics and machine learning applications to fundamental experiment. Primarily, I am an experimentalist but am always looking to expand my horizons. 

Currently, I am affiliated with the [ATLAS](https://atlas.cern) collaboration at [CERN](https://www.home.cern) through the University of Washington. The analysis I work on is focused on tau leptons; in particular, I am part of the team measuring the $$H \to \tau\tau$$ cross-section in the boosted regime and in measuring spin correlations in the $$Z \to \tau\tau$$ decay channel. Previously, I worked on the legacy Run 2 $$H \rightarrow \tau\tau$$ cross-section measurement and on algorithm development for $$\tau$$ energy scale calibration at the ATLAS experiment using a novel Mixture-Density-Network approach.

I was recently awarded the [WATCHEP fellowship](https://watchep.org). This fellowship provides two years of funding in research in computation related to high-energy particle physics. For this fellowship, I am working on various implementations of tracking for particle physics as-a-serivce. This includes GPU acceleration as-a-service with an [implementation](https://github.com/milescb/traccc-aaS/tree/main) of the existing tracking library [traccc](https://github.com/acts-project/traccc) and GNN as-a-servive for the [GNN4ITk project](https://indico.jlab.org/event/459/papers/11414/files/1342-CHEP2023_GNN4ITK.pdf).
