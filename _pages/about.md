Hello! My name is Michelle Pirrone and I am currently a PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder in the Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering Department (ECEE) who is currently working the Applied Metrology Group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Before coming to Colorado, I attended the State University of New York at New Paltz and graduated with a Bachelor of Science, majoring in Electrical Engineering and minoring in Biology.

My current research interests are in the field of interference testing on communication systems, including evaluating best practices for EMC testing and investigating important variables within communication signals for interference impacts. I previously worked on combining RF hardware with optimization and machine learning to improve RF performance in adaptive systems. Additional other experience includes RF design, specifically amplifiers and antennas, 3D-printed RF structures, and kinematics studies in the biology department. I enjoy interdisciplinary work and am always looking to make connections between different fields of research for exciting new opportunities and projects. 


Check out the rest of my website for more information on current and past research [projects](/al-folio/projects/), [publications](/al-folio/publications/), work history, and [awards](/al-folio/awards/) I have received. Also, be sure to connect on LinkedIn or reach out to me by email to get in touch!
