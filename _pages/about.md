I am a PhD student in Artificial Intelligence and Music at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk).
I am working on neural audio synthesis, the psychoacoustics of timbre, and applications of deep generative models to audio.
I am very grateful to be funded by the [UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Artificial Intelligence and Music](https://www.aim.qmul.ac.uk/),
and am a member of the [Centre for Digital Music](https://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/).

Previously, I was Music Lead at the award-winning AI-driven generative music startup [Jukedeck](https://www.linkedin.com/company/jukedeck/about/).
