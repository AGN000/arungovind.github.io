I am a computer scientist and engineer who loves data and algorithms.

I have a PhD in Computer Engineering and a Master in Artificial Intelligence. I worked for several years at the University of Porto, where I lectured computer science subjects and researched pattern matching and other AI-related topics. I was fortunate to work with École Polytechnique de Montréal, University College of London, the University of Gent, and Carnegie Mellon University. In 2015 I joined [Veniam](http://www.veniam.com), an exciting startup where I am currently the Principal Data Scientist and where I am driving Data (Science, Engineering and Analytics).

I love to learn and to share what I learn. I also love to build new things and solve problems. That is why I have created [SPyQL](https://github.com/dcmoura/spyql), an open source project for querying data with SQL powered by Python expressions.

I love being surrounded by nature, hiking, dancing, and spending time with my family and friends. I also love playing sports, from football/soccer to chess :-)
