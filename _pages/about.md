Hey! I'm currently a Master's student at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu), majoring in Business Analytics. On a day to day basis at school, I enjoy learning to apply state of the art algorithmic techniques to solve challenging business problems. I recently graduated from [National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli](https://www.nitt.edu) with distinction in Chemical Engineering. 



Outside of work, I enjoy playing Chess, solving Sudokus and long distance running!
