 I like working with numerical models and topics related to Atmospheric Physics. I enjoy using programming tools to analyze big data and finding patterns. My research interest includes but is not limited to large-scale atmospheric circulation, seasonal to decadal variations in large-scale atmospheric properties, and climate response to forcing from anthropogenic and natural sources. I have graduated with a Ph.D. in Climate Dynamics from George Mason University in Fall 2020 and joined NASA GSFC at [Global Modeling and Assimilation office](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/) in December 2020.

**My Current research at NASA includes:** Air-Sea-Ice interaction, Climate model development, High resolution climate modeling, Annual to decadal climate prediction. My current project at Goddard focuses on developing and analyzing a novel prototype, property-conserving, ocean-ice-atmosphere model, and data assimilation system based on the Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS) in conjunction with the adjoint-model capabilities of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm). The resulting data assimilation system and an inferred solution will be used to study inter-annual to decadal prediction and predictability in the coupled system.

**Tools I use/used in my research-**

**Models:** GEOST, MITgcm, CESM, WRF.  
**Programming Language:** Python, MATLAB, R, NCL, GrADS, Latex, C, bash scripting.  
**Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, Deep Learning, Keras, Tensorflow, RNN (LSTM, GRU), kNN.
