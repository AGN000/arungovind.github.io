My name is Ayyuce, and I'm a machine learning engineer and a published researcher with a strong focus on vision transformers and medical images. Currently, I'm actively working on leveraging vision transformers for medical image analysis, aiming to contribute to the field by solving real-world problems. Additionally, I'm also interested in developing efficient fine-tuning techniques for large language models. I hold a bachelor's degree in computer engineering and have a deep passion for machine learning. In the near future, I plan to pursue a Ph.D. in machine learning to further expand my knowledge and expertise.

I have extensive experience in building and deploying machine learning models for various applications. I'm particularly interested in staying up-to-date with the latest research and techniques in the field. As a dedicated learner, I consistently seek out new challenges to tackle and explore innovative approaches.

Resume is available upon request.
