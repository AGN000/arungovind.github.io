Currently working as a strategy/prediction specialist at [L2F](https://www.l2f.ch){:target="\_blank"}, a new start-up in EPFL's Innovation Park. Previously studied pure maths and a little CS at Oxford (self-taught machine learning). Master thesis in multi-agent learning, paper to come.

Looking to do a PhD after some time at L2F. I'd like to find a nice area where 'abstract' mathematical understanding really complements and improves applications in AI. Maybe something like manifold learning? Also concerned about the widening gap between the very rich and everybody else. Could be worsened by AI if left to its own instruments. Possibility of throwing away this cerebral life and trying something more heartful.

Otherwise I love climbing, dancing, cold showers, trees and music. :)
