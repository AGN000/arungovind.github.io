I am a fourth year PhD student in the [Department of Statistical Science at Duke University](http://stat.duke.edu) working with [Peter Hoff](http://pdhoff.github.io).

Prior to coming to Duke, I worked on various macroeconomic theory projects with The Macroeconomic and Quantitative Studies group at [The Federal Reserve Board](http://federalreserve.gov).
