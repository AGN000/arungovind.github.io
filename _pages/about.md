Hallo! I’m currently a PhD candidate at Osaka University supervised by [Takufumi Yanagisawa](https://cinet.jp/english/people/20161909/).

My goal is to develop accurate brain decoding and encoding algorithms, with the aspiration that my research can significantly benefit individuals facing challenges in communication or movement. To achieve this, I employ machine learning techniques to explore and understand the processes by which the human brain interprets information. This includes investigating the latent space and the underlying geometric representations of visual, auditory, and sensory information within the brain. My goal is to identify and refine algorithms that accurately represent and interpret these stimuli, thereby enhancing our ability to decode brain activity effectively.

Prior to my PhD, I completed my master’s degree at Kyoto University. During my master’s studies, I developed a method to reconstruct images from brain activity patterns.

Besides work, I like to play volleyball, go cycling, hiking, and running and have finished running a marathon twice. I used to play double dutch with a team during my master’s studies at Kyoto University, and we had several performances at Kyoto University festivals. I sometimes play the violin during my free time, and once played in an orchestra.
