I received my Master degree with 'Cum Laude' in 2017 from **[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/)** (KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium), under the supervision of **[Prof.Erik Jan Marinissen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikjanmarinissen/?originalSubdomain=be)** and **[Prof.Hailong Jiao](http://www.pku-vlsi.com/sample-page/hailong_jiao/)**. Before that, I received the Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Engineering degree in 2016 from both **KU Leuven** and **[University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/)** (UESTC, Chengdu, China), respectively.

Currently, my research interest lies in the intersection among computer security, machine learning and software engineering, with special emphasis in AI security and AI testing.
