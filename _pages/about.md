Currently, I am a software engineer at Apple; and I have interests
in applied and computational mathematics, machine learning, and
statisics research and applications. 

Previously, I obtained my PhD in mathematics from Nanyang Technological
University (NTU) in 2022. In my [dissertation](https://hdl.handle.net/10356/163311),
I introduced an inductive bias that endows additive models and their
fitting algorithms with the ability to acquire, and leverage, prior
knowledge in the form of predictions from a base model. Importantly,
it resulted in a generalization of gradient boosting, known as base
boosting, which is a fusion between the method of reroughing and the
paradigm of gradient boosting.

Additionally, I am an original member of the 
[Mathematical Picture Language Project](https://mathpicture.fas.harvard.edu/)
at Harvard University, where I established the link between the mathematics
of planar algebras and the science of quantum information and computation.
