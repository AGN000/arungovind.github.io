I'm an MS in Computer Science student at UMass Amherst currently working with Prof. [Andrew McCallum](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/) at [IESL](http://www.iesl.cs.umass.edu/) . My research interests are in Natural Language Understanding, Text generation and Unsupervised Learning.

Previously, I was an Analyst at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/). I also completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science at [Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad](https://iith.ac.in/) where I worked primarily on Bayesian Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing with Prof. [Srijith P.K.](https://sites.google.com/site/pksrijith/home).
