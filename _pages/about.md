<b>Research and professional interests:</b> Data Science, Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Operations Research.

I am  particularly interested in foundations and algorithmic aspects of Data Science as well as its disruptive engineering applications.

My passion is to build a two-way bridge connecting research and practice - real-life challenges fueling fundamental scientific progress; and scientific advances driving technological disruptions with commercial and societal impact.

<b>Short Bio:</b> Prior to founding my startup, I have been at Lyft Labs (worked on core marketplace problems such as dispatch, matching, vehicle repositioning, passenger walk optimization, and AV fleet management), Twitter (worked on content relevance, advertisement targeting and user identity bridging through network link prediction, similarity search and spatio-temporal user modeling) and IBM Research (worked on biomedical information extraction for drug discovery).


Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Algorithms and Complexity group at [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home/) and in the College of Computer Sciences at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/).

I received my PhD in Computer Science from [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research](https://www.tifr.res.in/) advised by [ Prof. Jaikumar Radhakrishnan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaikumar_Radhakrishnan), and my undergraduate degree (B.Tech.) in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIT Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/).
