Hi, I love building machine learning systems including model development. I deeply believe, that implementing an algorithm/framework by yourself gives you the best understanding. Followed by ~~play~~ experimenting with your solution to come up with a finished product. This is the joy of building projects. :zzz:

In my previous life, I run numerical simulation to get a better understanding of the chemical interactions between water and our environment. :earth_africa: :sunflower:
Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
