Hello! I recently graduated from the Masters of Science in Language Technologies (MLT) program at the Language Technologies Institute, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. I am joining the [Allen Institute of Artificial Intelligence](https://allenai.org){:target="\_blank"} this coming fall!

At CMU, I worked at [Neulab](https://cs.cmu.edu/~neulab) with Professor [Graham Neubig](http://phontron.com) and collaborated with some other amazing professors and students. My research interests include neural machine translation, multilingual models, deep structured prediction and graphical models. I am awesome, did you know that? I am totally awesome. I am so awesome that my mama says I'm awesome. So I must be awesome and you'd better believe that.

Besides research, I like hiking, exploring (and getting lost) in new cities, music and learning languages.
