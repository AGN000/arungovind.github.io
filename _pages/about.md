Hi! Iâ€™m a PhD student in [Information Science at Cornell](https://infosci.cornell.edu/phd/), where I study fairness in sociotechnical systems with [Allison Koenecke](https://koenecke.infosci.cornell.edu/) and [Rene Kizilcec](https://rene.kizilcec.com/), and am a member of the [AI, Policy, and Practice (AIPP)](https://aipp.cis.cornell.edu/people/) working group. I am also a research assistant on the ["Expanding AI Audits"](https://techethicslab.nd.edu/call-for-proposals/2022-cfp/#:~:text=Expanding,-AI%20Audits%20to) team as part of the [Sloane Lab](https://www.monasloane.org/sloane-lab), and have previously worked as a research intern at [Microsoft FATE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/fate/) and collaborated on research with the [Algorithmic Justice League](https://www.ajl.org/) and the [Compliant and Accountable Systems lab](https://www.compacctsys.net/) at the University of Cambridge.

I'm also really excited about teaching ethical AI - most recently, I co-led a [Responsible AI course](https://emmaharv.github.io/responsible-ai-capstone/) with [David Danks](https://www.daviddanks.org/) for UCSD's Data Science Capstone.

Previously, I worked as a data scientist at a consulting firm, where I focused on conducting real-world algorithm audits. I received my BA in Computer Science and Philosophy, Politics, & Economics from the University of Pennsylvania.

In my free time, you can find me reading [vaguely upsetting novels](https://emmaharv.github.io/bookshelf/) (recommendations always welcome!) or [training for the 2024 New York City Marathon](https://www.strava.com/athletes/112159683).
