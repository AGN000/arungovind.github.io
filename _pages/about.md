Giulia earned her Ph.D. in Computer Science from UC Berkeley under the supervision of [Aydın Buluç](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~aydin/) and [Kathy Yelick](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yelick/) in August 2022. Giulia is a [2020 SIGHPC Computational & Data Science Fellow](https://www.sighpc.org/for-your-career/fellowships/2020-fellowship-winners?fbclid=IwAR2N8swtCYgNH3phRmrFtASSC42b4oN5joG1l5XHFSdnkMY6U4HvZt3olLE) and currently a Project Scientist in the Applied Math and Computational Sciences Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

Giulia will be an **Assistant Professor of Computer Science** at [Cornell University](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/) starting Spring 2023.

<!--and a member of the [PASSION Lab](https://passion.lbl.gov/), the [BeBOp Group](https://bebop.cs.berkeley.edu/), and the [Performance and Algorithms Research (PAR) Group](https://crd.lbl.gov/departments/computer-science/par/members/students/giulia-guidi/). Giulia received her M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering from [Politecnico di Milano](http://polimi.it/en).-->

Giulia works on the challenges of large-scale computational biology and the algorithms and software infrastructures that meet the usability and performance demand of this community, as well as how to make cloud computing more accessible for high-performance scientific computing.
Giulia's research goal is to make writing high-performance genomics code as easy as writing high-performance Deep Learning code.
Giulia is generally interested in the intersection of High-Performance Computing (HPC), Computer Systems, and Computational Biology as enabling technologies that enable faster, higher-quality bioinformatics and biomedical research.

<!--Currently, she is developing a novel algorithm for de novo assembly of genomes in distributed memory using long-read sequencing data and sparse matrix abstraction as part of the [ExaBiome](https://sites.google.com/lbl.gov/exabiome) project.-->

Here are a recent **[CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DmJgPIFg6S-B0bqvqWFUmrmk6czYVmy5/view?usp=sharing)** (August 2022) and the Tl;dr version of my **[Research Statement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_HVC4HkkyBMqUx8AiTHeyjgwlSdYG3j6/view?usp=sharing)**.

**I am recruiting PhD students for the 2023/24 Academic Year.** The best way to contact me is by **email**: gg434 at cornell dot edu. The admission process is through Cornell CIS and not through me personally. So it is **pointless** to send me a CV and ask about the chances of admission. Information about the admissions process can be found at Cornell CIS [here](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/phd/admissions). I will ignore any email that does not clearly indicate a genuine interest in my work. To express interest in my work, you need to show that (1) you have some idea of what I do, (2) you have a background that at least intrigues me, and (3) my work is of interest to you. You can do this is to show that you have read some of my work or used my software in some interesting way.

Dog person, in general. German Shepherd person, in particular.
