Hello, I'm Kangneoung Lee.
I'm a Ph.D student in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Texas A&M University,
where I am advised by [Dr. Kiju Lee](https://engineering.tamu.edu/etid/profiles/lee-kiju.html).
I'm currently a member of [Adaptive Robotics and Technology Lab](https://art.engr.tamu.edu/).
