Hi there âœ‹

My name is Alireza Dehghanzadeh (its written this way, you can type `alerezaa` in [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com) to hear the pronounciation)

BTW...

I'm a Researcher at [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en) in Master Degree. Bachelor completed at [University of Tabriz](https://tabrizu.ac.ir/en) in Biosystems Engineering.
