I am an Applied Economist from Universidad Centroamericana (UCA), Nicaragua. Macroeconomics, international economics and monetary economics are my current academic and professional interests.

Prior to attending UCA, I had participated in several mathematical olympiads, most notably, the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) and the Iberoamerican Mathematical Olympiad (IbMO). I am still actively involved in olympiad activities as an Euclidean Geometry instructor at Academia Sabatina de JÃ³venes Talento (ASJTNIC), Nicaragua.

I will join the Economics Department of Emory University as a Ph.D. student next fall.
