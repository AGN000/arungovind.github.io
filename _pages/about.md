I'm a cognitive scientist based at the University of Cambridge in the Department of Psychology. Before coming to Cambridge, I held research positions at the ARC Centre of Excellence in Cognition and Its Disorders at Macquarie University (Sydney, Australia), and the Donders Institute for Brain, Behaviour, and Cognition at Radboud University (Nijmegen, Netherlands). I also held a lectureship in the School of Psychology at the Australian Catholic University (Brisbane, Australia). My work spans neuroscience, experimental psychology, and philosophy and I try to investigate problems at multiple levels and from multiple perspectives.

I completed my PhD, titled Predicting the Actions of Other Agents, in 2012 in the Department of Cognitive Science at Macquarie University, where I was affiliated with the Collective Cognition Research Group, the Perception and Action Research Centre, and the Music, Sound, and Performance Laboratory. Prior to this, I completed by Bachelor and Master of Science degree in the Department of Psychology at the University of Auckland.
