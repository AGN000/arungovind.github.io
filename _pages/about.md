I'm an AI research engineer at <a href="https://naver-career.gitbook.io/en/teams/clova-cic">NAVER AI Lab & CLOVA</a>.
My broad research interest is in machine learning and its applications to real-world systems.
In particular, I'm researching <strong>representation learning for structured data</strong> including graph representation learning and large-scale time-series prediction at NAVER.

I received my B.S. and M.S. degree in Aerospace Engineering from KAIST in 2017 and 2019, respectively, 
under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v5hGAWMAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Han-Lim Choi</a>.
During my masterâ€™s degree, I researched <strong>probabilistic latent variable models</strong> for dynamical systems.
