Hi! I am Samyak. I am currently working at Microsoft Research (MSR) at Bangalore as a Research Fellow, where I am advised by [Navin Goyal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w8WJCnkAAAAJ&hl=en). I am generally interested in research areas related to understanding the inductive biases of the learning algorithms, which can help us explain different intriguing observations: emergence of capabilities, generalization of gradient descent etc. At the heart of this, requires understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks. For this I aim to combine tools from learning theory and mechanistic interpretability. I am also interested in domains related to AI Safety, like cooperative alignment, adversarial robustness and safety fine-tuning.

Previously, I have worked with [Puneet Dokania](https://puneetkdokania.github.io) and [David Krueger](https://www.kasl.ai) at Five AI and Cambridge University and prior to this I was an intern with [Venkatesh Babu](https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/) at [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/) (IISc). Over the past year, my work has been focused on understanding (safety) fine-tuning using mechanistic interpretability. Prior to that, my work was focussed on understanding and improving adversarial robustness of neural networks during my internships at IISc and coursework in [Computer Science](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse) at the [Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varansi](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/). My works have been published at these [venues](https://scholar.google.pl/citations?user=aKCRSv0AAAAJ&hl=en)

Besides this, I actively participate in machine learning  and computer vision conferences and I have served as a reviewer at multiple conferences and won outstanding reviewer awards at ICLR 2022 and CVPR 2022.
Here is the link to my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WGkicIJ8dW3nZ51kVl_ZNyv66our7V7k/view?usp=sharing).
