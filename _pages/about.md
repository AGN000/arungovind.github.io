I am a second-year PhD student at the [Data Intelligence and Computing Art Laboratory](http://dicalab.cn/), College of Computer Science, [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/), and the [Engineering Research Center of Machine Learning and Industry Intelligence, Education Ministry of China](https://center.dicalab.cn/), under the guidance of [Prof. Jiancheng Lv](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0TCaWKwAAAAJ).

My current research interests include generative models (more specifically diffusion models), computer vision, and broad deep learning topics in general. Previously, I conducted research on multi-modal representation learning and unsupervised learning for a certain period, collaborating closely with [Prof. Shudong Huang](https://huangsd.github.io/).

My academic journey has been marked by several honors and awards, including the `PhD Innovation Scholarship`, `NPIC Scholarship`, `Firstâ€‘class Scholarship`, `The Academic Star of Graduate Students`, and recognition as one of the `Outstanding Graduate Students of Sichuan Province` and `Top 10 Student Collectives of Sichuan University`.
