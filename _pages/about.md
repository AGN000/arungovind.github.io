I'm Minh, a Computer scientist, a day-dreamer and night-thinker. I grew up in VietNam.
I'm currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in <b>Computer Vision</b> and <b>Machine Learning</b> at [EPITA Research Laboratory](https://www.lrde.epita.fr/wiki/Home). I obtained my Ph.D. and master degrees from <b>Sorbonne University</b> and <b>IMT Atlantic University</b> (former Telecom Bretagne), respectively.

My primary research interests are computer vision and artificial intelligent. 
I'm working in the intersection of medical imaging, remote sensing, computer vision and machine learning. 
In particular, I am interested in learning topological/geometric representations for deep image understanding, learning with imperfect data and experiencing with transformer-based models.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
