Greetings!

My name is Zheyuan (Brian) Zhang (张喆元 in chinese). I am a Robotics MS student in the [Robotics Institute](https://robotics.umich.edu/) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). Currently, I am doing research at the [Situated Language and Embodied Dialogue (SLED)](https://sled.eecs.umich.edu/) lab, advised by Professor [Joyce Chai](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~chaijy/). Prior to UMich, I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science (B.S.) from [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), [College of Information & Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/).

My [research interests](blog/2022/research-interests/) lie in the intersection of artificial intelligence and cognitive science because I am particularly curious about how the brain works and how we understand the world. To this end, I want to incorporate ideas from cognitive psychology and neuroscience into the creation of computational AI models. Currently, my research focuses on Deep Learning, Multimodal Learning, Continual Learning and Embodied Intelligence.
