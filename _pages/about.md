Hi, I am a senior in [Intelligent Network Architecture Research Group](http://ina.kaist.ac.kr/) at KAIST, advised by [Prof. Dongsu Han](http://ina.kaist.ac.kr/~dongsuh/). 

I am a Korean student who has grown up in Mexico, Poland, and Romania. Finishing my undergraduate studies at KAIST, I got to experience quite a lot of things. 

I have worked on 3D volumetric video streaming using Kinect Azure Cameras, and will soon be working on in-network processing using S-NIC at [UTNS](https://utns.cs.utexas.edu/), advised by [Prof. Daehyeok Kim](https://daehyeok.kim/).

My research interest lies in making efficient and fast networked systems whether it be through optimizing applications, designing new systems, or in-network processing. This website will be used as an experience journal for what I've done since 2018.
