I'm a 3rd year Ph.D. student at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/), working at [Center of Data Science and Complexity for Society](https://cdcs.di.uniroma1.it/) under the supervision of [Prof. Walter Quattrociocchi](https://walterquattrociocchi.site.uniroma1.it/). My research activity focuses on data-driven modelling of social dynamics, with a particular interest on understanding opinion diffusion on social media and its interplay with content moderation policies.
