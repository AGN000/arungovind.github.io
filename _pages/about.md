Hi there! I'm Chinmaya Kausik, a rising 2nd year mathematics Ph.D. student at UMich working on sequential decision making, statistics, optimization and machine learning. I am being co-advised by [Prof. Ambuj Tewari](https://ambujtewari.github.io/) and [Prof. Martin Strauss](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~martinjs/).

A lot of my undergraduate background is in geometry, topology and dynamics with work in computer-assisted topology and geometry. Check out my [projects](projects) (along with post-mortems) and [interests](more)!

**What do I care about, broadly?** 
* Mathematical problems motivated by tangible, real-world questions. 
* Increasing accessibility to and in higher mathematics and creating communities where ideas cross pollinate and people pull each other up[^1].

[^1]: This is part of why I co-founded and co-organize [Monsoon Math Camp](https://www.monsoonmath.org) - an online math camp for promising high school students introducing them to advanced undergraduate and graduate-level math. You should check it out! I have also been involved in building and expanding other mathematical communities, like platforms for the PolyMath REU, DRP programs and the undergraduate math organization at IISc, etc.

**What am I doing these days?**
* Working in [Prof. Ambuj Tewari's lab](https://ambujtewari.github.io/) over the summer.
* Thinking about offline RL in confounded tabular MDPs.
* Thinking about minimax optimal algorithms for offline policy evaluation and the role of the geometry of action sets.
* Trying to learn more about safe RL and differential privacy.
* Working on double descent in denoising under the guidance of [Rishi Sonthalia](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/rsonthal/home?authuser=0). Work continued from [MREG 2022](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/mreg-2022/home).
* Continuing work on our project from [LOGML 2022](https://www.logml.ai/)! I was a participant in Dr. Eli Meirom's group, planning to work on using RL for graph rewiring in GNNs to prevent oversquashing for long range problems.
* To provide a glimpse into graduate student life and also create a greater sense of accountability for myself, attempting to maintain a [periodic log](log) of my academic/professional progress on this website. 
* Fleshing out ideas for more academic communities like Monsoon Math.

**What do I want to learn about in the future?**
* Differential Privacy and how we can provide the best DP guarantees for various sequential decision making scenarios.
* Safe RL, its relation to the problem of engineering good rewards and its relation to fairness.
* A comprehensive view of techniques that go into minimax lower bounds in RL.
* Causality and its interaction with sequential decision making and RL.
* Algorithmic fairness.
* Geometric and topological insights for data analysis and machine learning (for example, non-positive curvature representation learning).
* Natural Language Processing.
* Using insights from machine learning for biology. In a specific example, learning a hierarchical or causal structure from genomics data.
