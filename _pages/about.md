Let me start by introducing myself. The name is Vishal Kumar. If not here by mistake, there is a strong possibility the some of you might know me by "Kumar Vishal". And, finally, the addition of "Rai" above is a consequence of my (quite recent!) insatiable desire to belong to my ancestral family line by appending the original surname, at-least un-officially.

There you go! After such a clear introduction, let's get straight to discussing some trivial matters. I am interested in studying fluid flows. No I don't know everything about them, I just like playing with them. 

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
