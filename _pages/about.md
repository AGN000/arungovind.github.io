:) Hi, I am a Ph.D. student in [Computer Science](https://cs.utdallas.edu/) at [the University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/), under the supervision of Dr. [Andrian Marcus](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~amarcus/index.html). Previously, I obtained my bachelor degree from [department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.sustech.edu.cn/en/) of [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), and advised by Dr. [Shin Hwei Tan](https://www.shinhwei.com/).
