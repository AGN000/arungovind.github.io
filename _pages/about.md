Hello! My name is Michelle Pirrone and I am currently a PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder in the Electrical,Computer, and Energy Engineering Department (ECEE). Before coming to Colorado, I attended the State University of New York at New Paltz and graduated with a Bachelor's of Science, majoring in Electrical Engineering and minoring in Biology.

My current research interests are in the fields of optimization and machine learning theory and techniques and how these can be applied to improve performance in feedback systems. I have previously worked on RF design, specifically amplifiers and antennas, 3D-printed RF structures, and on kinematics in the biology department. I enjoy interdisciplinary work and am always looking to make connections between different fields of research for exciting new opportunities and projects. 


Check out the rest of my website for more information on current and past research [projects](/al-folio/projects/), [publications](/al-folio/publications/), work history, and [awards](/al-folio/awards/) I have received. Also, be sure to connect on LinkedIn or reach out to me by email to get in touch!
