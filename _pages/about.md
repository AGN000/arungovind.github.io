Welcome! Myself Shetu Mohanto. I received my Bachelor from KUET in 2023 from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering.

Currently I'm working as a lecturer in the department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at the Green University of Bangladesh.

I worked with Prof. <a href="https://www.kuet.ac.bd/eee/suyusuf/">Dr. Md. Salah Uddin Yusuf</a> during my undergraduate thesis. We worked on object detection and efficient implementation of the DL model. 

In my spare time, I like to play the guitar, you can watch some of my performances on YouTube (just search for "Shetu Mohanto").
