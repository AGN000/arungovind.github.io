I'm currently a first-year Computer Sience & Engineering Ph.D. student at UC Santa Cruz, where I'm fortunately advised by Professor [Cihang Xie](https://cihangxie.github.io/). I'm broadly interested in computer vision and machine learning. Previously, I got my bachelor degree at School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University in June 2021.
