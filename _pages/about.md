Hi! Thank you for stopping by. My name is Le Hoang Khanh, but you can call me Harry. <br>
I spent 3 years in high school learning and taking some Competitive Programming. <br>
I graduated in Ho Chi Minh University of Technology, major in electrical Engineering. <br>
I'm a Math and Data Science Enthusiast. Got some experiences at various domains such as: Embedded, Hardware Design, E-commerce, Digital Marketing, Bank & Finance, Web Development and Data Science of course. <br> <br>
In career, I would love to find and solve some solutions or inventions that automate the human process, reduce human effort in daily job for a better life. <br>
In lifestyle, I'm an audiophile, coffee lover, runner, biker and sometime a game player, lol. <br>
I'm currently working at FPT Software as a Data Scientist. Some of my projects related to Timeseries, Recommendation,...  <br>
I've just finished a project related to AI Trader with 2 team members which I will share on this blog soon. <br>
