I am a PhD student at the Machine Learning Department atÂ Carnegie Mellon University, working real-world embodied AI and computer vision to make [mobile manipulators](https://hello-robot.com/product) do useful alongside humans with [Prof. Katerina Fragkiadaki](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~katef). Prior to joining CMU, I graduated from McGill University, Canada, with a B.Sc. in Computer Science & Mathematics, where I worked with Prof. [Doina Precup](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup/index.html). In 2020-2022, I took a leave from the PhD to build the ML team of an [early-stage data privacy startup](https://www.relyance.ai/).

In my spare time, I enjoy good food and wine, nature and traveling, and lifting weights while listening to history/philosophy podcasts. Also, I grew up in Paris, and my English accent has long been stuck at a local optimum.
