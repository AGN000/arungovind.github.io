Hello! I am a Master's student in **Computer Science** at [**Georgia Tech**](https://www.gatech.edu/) and a Data Engineer Analyst at **Walmart Canada**. I live in downtown Toronto with Roxy - my lovable dog.

I earned my first Master’s degree in **Chemical Engineering** from the **University of Calgary** in 2020. Since then, I have gained over four years of professional experience in the **data** field, focusing on **database architecture**, **data pipeline engineering**, and **data visualization**.

Over the past year, through work and academic opportunities, I have cultivated a strong interest in emerging technologies, exploring areas such as **AI learning algorithms**, **machine learning applications**, and **natural language processing**. In 2022, I embarked on my second Master’s program at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**, with an anticipated graduation in 2025.

I am fluent in both **English** and **Mandarin Chinese**.
