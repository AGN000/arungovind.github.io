Hi,

I love building machine learning systems including model development.

I deeply believe, that implementing an algorithm or a framework by yourself gives you the best understanding. Followed by ~~playing~~ experimenting until the solution looks beautiful.
I enjoy building projects beyond copy and paste. :zzz::zzz:

In my previous life, I ran numerical simulation to get a better understanding of the chemical interactions between water and our environment. :earth_africa: :ocean::sunflower:
