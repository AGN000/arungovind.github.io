I am an AI systems scientist at the Palo Alto Research Center. I study human-aware AI - how to design intelligent interactive systems that model, learn, and reason about their human collaborators. I am especially interested in methods for effective and robust human-agent collaborative behavior in real-world settings. My research spans artificial intelligence & machine learning and leverages insights about human behavior from cognitive science, linguistics, and economics.

I have designed intelligent collaborative agents for a variety of application domains including general purpose robots, preventive healthcare, sustainable transportation, and augmented reality learning. I am particularly motivated to build intelligent collaborative technology for social good and public welfare. My work is interdisciplinary and has been published at venues for research on artificial intelligence, human cognition, human-computer interaction, and medical informatics & engineering.

Humans of AI summarizes my ongoing research and outlines my research agenda on incorporating explicit models of humans in design of collaborative AI systems. My research statement explains it in more detail.
