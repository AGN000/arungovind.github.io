Hi! My name is Simon. I am a graduate student at MIT working with Boris Kozinsky at Harvard. 
I am interested in advancing science using ideas the revolve around statistical inference, statistical learning, and statistical computing. Current research focuses on alleviating the computational cost of quantum electronic-structure calculations using machine learning.  

Prior to joining Harvard, I worked on different problems in machine learning with Alexie Kolpak at MIT. I also spent a year with the NASA mission SOFIA, working on statistical learning for dynamical systems and flight data analysis.  
In my free time, I enjoy the mountains, hiking, and listening to the beautiful sounds of the Foo Fighters. I'm always happy to talk about maths, machine learning and statistics. Feel free to reach out!
