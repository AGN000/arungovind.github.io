I am an AI systems scientist at the [Palo Alto Research Center](https://www.parc.com/). I study [human-aware](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.07089.pdf) AI - how to design intelligent interactive systems that model, learn, and reason about their human collaborators. I am
especially interested in methods for effective and robust human-agent collaborative behavior in real-world settings. My research spans artificial intelligence & machine learning and leverages insights about human behavior from
cognitive science, linguistics, and economics.

I have designed intelligent collaborative agents for a variety of application domains [general](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01962) [purpose](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/viewPaper/17261) [robots](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8630/8446), [preventive](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3366501) [healthcare](https://www.jmir.org/2017/11/e397/),  [sustainable](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11352) [transportation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3306618.3314271), and [augmented reality learning](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2327/IUI19WS-USER2AGENT-1.pdf). I am particularly motivated to build intelligent collaborative technology [social good and public welfare](https://cra.org/ccc/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/04/AI-for-Social-Good-Workshop-Report.pdf). My work is interdisciplinary and has been published at venues for research on artificial intelligence, human cognition, human-computer interaction, medical informatics & engineering, and AI & society.

[Humans of AI](./assets/pdf/humans_of_ai.pdf) summarizes my ongoing research and outlines my research agenda on incorporating explicit models of humans in design of collaborative AI systems. My [research statement](./assets/pdf/ResearchStatement.pdf) explains it in more detail

I am a graduate of the [Soar lab](https://soar.eecs.umich.edu/) led by [John E. Laird](https://laird.engin.umich.edu) that traces its legacy to [foundational research on human cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Theories_of_Cognition) by [Allen Newell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Newell) and human decision making by [Herbert Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon). My graduate experience set me on this wonderful journey in studying the computational underpinnings of human intelligence and building intelligent systems that support humans.
