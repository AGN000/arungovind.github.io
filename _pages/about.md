I'm a computer science MSc. student from the Technion and currently working as an algorithm engineer.

Interested in solving difficult problems which don't yet have a solution, mostly in the fields of algorithms, autonomous systems and quantum physics.
Enjoy designing system architectures and providing end to end solutions.

I also do web development and digital marketing for various businesses.

Currently researching for algorithms that can predict future atrial fibrilation sessions in patients by reading their ECG signals.
