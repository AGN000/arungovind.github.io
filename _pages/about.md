I'm currently a Master student at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), supervised by Prof. [James J.Q. Yu](https://jamesyu.me/) Before that, I obtained my B.Eng. from Shandong University in June, 2019. My doctoral thesis was awarded the excellent Ph.D. thesis of Chinese Academy of Sciences. In 2018/04--2018/08, I was a visitor of Prof. [Qiang Yang](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~qyang/)'s group at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). My work on transfer learning has won the best paper awards in ICCSE 2018 and FTL-IJCAI 2019. In 2021, I published the textbook [迁移学习导论](http://jd92.wang/tlbook), a hands-on introduction to transfer learning. In 2022, I was selected into the list of [2022 AI 2000 Most Influential Scholars](https://www.aminer.cn/ai2000?domain_ids=5dc122672ebaa6faa962c2a4) by AMiner in recognition of my contributions in the field of multimedia between 2012-2021 (ranked 49/2000).

Research interest: transfer learning, out-of-distribution / domain generalization, semi-supervised learning, federated learning, and related applications such as activity recognition and computer vision. _Never stop looking for highly self-motivated students for internship or collaboration._
