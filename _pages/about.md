### :point_right: About Me :
Having taught history and geography for many years, I developed a deep love for understanding past events and their impact on our modern world.
However, since I was a child, I've also been drawn to the realm of coding and technology.
This transition journey into development started by an intense Full-Stack coding bootcamp at Le Wagon.

:student: I love to learn ! I'm committed to acquiring new skills, languages and technologies to enrich my journey as a developer.
