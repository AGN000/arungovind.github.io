Hi there!

I'm Esteban Carisimo, a Postdoctoral Researcher at [AquaLab](https://aqualab.cs.northwestern.edu), a group at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/) of [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu). My research focuses on diverse aspects of Internet topology, including IXPs, CDNs, transit diversity, network congestion with also interdisciplinary approaches to these topics. Prior to joining Northwestern, I obtained Doctoral (2020) and Engineering (2014) degrees from [Universidad de Buenos Aires](https://www.uba.ar/#/), where I was also appointed as Adjunct Professor of the Department of Computer Science of the [School of Engineering](https://www.fi.uba.ar) between 2020 and 2021.
