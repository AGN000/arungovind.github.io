Hi there! I'm Chinmaya Kausik, a 3rd year mathematics Ph.D. candidate at UMich working on **sequential decision making, statistics, optimization and machine learning**. I am being co-advised by [Prof. Ambuj Tewari](https://ambujtewari.github.io/) and [Prof. Martin Strauss](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~martinjs/).

Check out my [papers](papers), [past projects](projects) (along with post-mortems), and [personal interests](personal)!

  <summary markdown="span"> <b> What do I care about, academically? </b> </summary>
  
  * Mathematical problems motivated by tangible, real-world questions. These days, my work focuses on sequential decision making with offline data. I also have side projects in deep learning and control theory, and I intend to combine my current interests with ideas in differential privacy very soon. On the other hand, a lot of my undergraduate background was in geometry, topology and dynamics, with work in computer-assisted topology and geometry. 
  * Increasing accessibility to and in higher mathematics and creating communities where ideas cross pollinate and people pull each other up. This is part of why I co-founded and co-organize [Monsoon Math Camp](https://www.monsoonmath.org) - an online math camp for promising high school students introducing them to advanced undergraduate and graduate-level math. You should check it out! I have also been involved in building and expanding other mathematical communities, like platforms for the PolyMath REU, DRP programs and the undergraduate math organization at IISc, etc.

  <summary markdown="span"> <b> What am I doing these days? </b></summary>
  
  * Working on minimax optimal algorithms for offline policy evaluation (OPE) and the role of the geometry of action sets.
  * Working on extending work with Rishi Sonthalia and Kashvi Srivastava to non-linear denoising.
  * Continuing work on our project from [LOGML 2022](https://www.logml.ai/)! I was a participant in Dr. Eli Meirom's group, planning to work on using RL for graph rewiring in GNNs to prevent oversquashing for long range problems.
  * Thinking about extensions of De Finetti's theorem to decision processes.
  * Organizing an interdepartmental social initiative, SPAM (Statistics, Physics, Astronomy, Mathematics).
  * Fleshing out ideas for more academic communities like Monsoon Math.

  <summary markdown="span"> <b> What do I want to learn about/do in the future? </b></summary>
   
  _primary goals_
  * Algorithms for synthetic data with provable guarantees. For example, generating private synthetic data for time series, starting with MDPs and Markov Chains.
  * Work on learning other mixtures of time series with control input.
  * Find and work on an interesting problem at the intersection of privacy and sequential decision-making.
  * Start maintaining my progress [log](log) again.
  * Learn about safe RL and think about techniques beyond primal-dual ones, perhaps using model-based RL with uncertain models.
  * Watch lectures from the Data Driven Decision Processes program at the Simons Institute this semester.

  _side-quests_
  * Causal inference and its interaction with sequential decision making and RL.
  * Dive deeper into the theory behind GNNs and deep learning in general.
  * Algorithmic fairness.
  * Geometric and topological insights for data analysis and machine learning (for example, non-positive curvature representation learning).
  * Using insights from machine learning for biology. In a specific example, learning a hierarchical or causal structure from genomics
