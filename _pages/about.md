I'm a final year Master of Philosophy student in Intelligent Transportation at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), and I'm also working closely with the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy ([ITDP](https://www.itdp.org/)). My research interests include decarbonization in transportation and power grids, transportation planning and policies, and management science.

I am very fortunate to be co-supervised by [Prof. Wei WEI](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/WEI-Wei/wwei) and [Prof. Lin YANG](https://linyang-econ.com/) at HKUST(GZ).

I am currently looking for a Ph.D. position starting in Fall 2024.

You can find my CV [here](/assets/pdf/Jiewei_Li_CV.pdf) and contact me at [jliax@connect.ust.hk](mailto:jliax@connect.ust.hk).
