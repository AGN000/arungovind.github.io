Iâ€™m working as a Technical Product Manager for the Department of Defense, developing tools and techniques to enable data driven insights for performance and efficiencies.

I studied Physics and Computer Science at Austin Peay State University in Clarksville Tennessee, where I focused my undergraduate research on high altitude balloons. My research later took me to an internship at NASA's Balloon Research and Development Lab on Wallops Island Virginia.

My current technical interests are with web-based applications, data visualization, and general fun internet things.
