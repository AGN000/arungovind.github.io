Where I work on problems in computer vision and graphics. I recently received my bachelor in engineering bachelorâ€™s Degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Tribhuvan University, Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk.

 In 2021, I worked as an electronics engineer at NEAR Space. In 2020, I was a research intern in KIAS, where I design embedded system for weather station. I have worked as a Hardware Designer and Embedded System Programmer at Robotics club, Pulchowk Campus at my undergraduate years in college.
