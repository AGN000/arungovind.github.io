Hi there! I'm Chinmaya Kausik, a first-year mathematics Ph.D. student at UMich working on sequential decision making, statistics, optimization and machine learning. A lot of my undergraduate background is in geometry, topology and dynamics with work in computer-assisted topology and geometry.

Check out my [projects](projects) (along with post-mortems) and [interests](more)!

**What do I care about, broadly?** 
* Mathematical problems motivated by tangible, real-world questions. 
* Increasing accessibility to and in higher mathematics and creating communities where ideas cross pollinate and people pull each other up[^1].

[^1]: This is part of why I co-founded and co-organize [Monsoon Math Camp](https://www.monsoonmath.org) - an online math camp for promising high school students introducing them to advanced undergraduate and graduate-level math. You should check it out! I have also been involved in building and expanding other mathematical communities, like platforms for the PolyMath REU, DRP programs and the undergraduate math organization at IISc, etc.

**What am I doing these days?**
* Working in Prof. Ambuj Tewari's lab over summer.
* Thinking about offline RL in confounded tabular MDPs with global and i.i.d. confounders.
* Thinking about minimax optimal algorithms for offline policy evaluation, working towards the lofty goal of the equivalent of the Decision-Estimation Coefficient for offline RL.
* Trying to learn more about safe RL.
* Participating in MREG 2022 in Rishi Sonthalia's group on Double Descent and the NTK.
* To provide a glimpse into graduate student life and also create a greater sense of accountability for myself, attempting to maintain a [periodic log](log) of my academic/professional progress on this website. 
* Waiting to hear back from a journal about my paper on an algorithm for generalized Seifert matrices.
* Gearing up for Monsoon Math 2022!
* Fleshing out ideas for more academic communities like Monsoon Math.

**What do I want to learn about in the future?**
* Safe RL, its relation to the problem of engineering good rewards and its relation to AI safety and alignment.
* A comprehensive view of techniques that go into minimax lower bounds in RL.
* Causality and its interaction with sequential decision making and RL.
* Algorithmic fairness.
* Geometric and topological insights for data analysis and machine learning (for example, non-positive curvature representation learning).
* Natural Language Processing.
* Using insights from machine learning for biology. In a specific example, learning a hierarchical or causal structure from genomics data.
