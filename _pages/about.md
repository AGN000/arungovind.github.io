I am a PhD Candidate (ABD) in the Comparative Literature and Literary Theory Program at the University of Pennsylvania. In the academic year 2022-2023 I am also an affiliated researcher at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin and Friedrich Schlegel Graduiertenschule für literaturwissenschaftliche Studien (Berlin, Germany) and a DAAD One-Year Research Grant recepient. As an International Dissertation Research Fellow I am planning to conduct my research in multiple locations, including Germany, Mali, Ghana, and Russia. My dissertation is preliminary titled *The Gorky Literary Institute: Creative Writing under Socialism*. This interdisciplinary project examines how socialist creative writing institutions produced (or sometimes failed to produce) socialist writers and how they impacted the formation of the international “Soviet Republic of Letters.”
