I am currently a PhD physics student at the [University of the Philippines Diliman](https://upd.edu.ph/) and a member of the [Theoretical Physics Group](https://niptheorygroup.wordpress.com/) under the supervision of [Eric A. Galapon, PhD](http://nip.upd.edu.ph/profiles/eric-a-galapon/). I obtained my BS and MS degrees in 2017 and 2019, respectively, doing research on `quantum time of arrival`. You can download my CV [here]({{ '/assets/pdf/My_CV_v2.pdf' | relative_url }}).

The primary purpose of this blog is to hopefully help me `organize my thoughts` while doing research. By doing so, I hope to gain a `better understanding` of the very same topics I am writing about, e.g. explainers of some papers that I find interesting. So feel free to check out my [blog](/blog/) and write a comment. 

Aside from physics, my interests include watching `movies` and `anime`, reading `manga`, playing computer `games`, and customizing `gunpla` (gundam plastic models).
