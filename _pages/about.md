Welcome to my site! I am currently a post-doctoral researcher studying cancer systems biology at Vanderbilt University. I focus on data analysis and computational modeling of phenotypic transitions in Small Cell Lung Cancer. After receiving a B.S. in physics and math from The College of William & Mary in 2016, I entered Vanderbilt via their quantitative and chemical biology program and completed my PhD in the Quaranta Lab in March 2022. I consider myself a physicist by training and a data scientist by practice. My research experiences in undergrad, graduate school, and my post-doc allow me to combine these identities to approach complex biological problems through the analysis and modeling of and high-dimensional data.


Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
