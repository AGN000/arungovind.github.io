Welcome to to the website of Dr. Thomas Pisanic and the Epidiagnostics Group at the Johns Hopkins <a href = "https://inbt.jhu.edu">Institute of NanoBioTechnology</a>! I work with the <a href = "https://me.jhu.edu/thwang/">Wang laboratory</a> and an interdisciplinary cadre of researchers to gain deeper insights into the epigenetics of carcinogenesis to apply this knowledge toward developing novel molecular analysis methods for cancer diagnostic applications. Our <a href="/team/">team</a> is comprised of faculty with a wide range of complementary expertise, including: <a href = "/members/Pisanic">Dr. Thomas Pisanic </a> (biomarker discovery and assay development), <a href = "https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/tza-huei-jeff-wang/"> Dr. Tza-Huei Wang </a>(engineering and microfluidic technologies), <a href ="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/hariharan-easwaran">Dr. Hari Easwaran </a> (genetics and epigenetics of cancer and aging) and <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/leslie-cope">Dr. Leslie Cope</a> (biostatistics and bioinformatics). Together, we work with a diverse array of <a href ="/collaborators">extraordinary collaborators</a> from Johns Hopkins and beyond to apply our epigenetic methods to resolve manifold challenges in various areas of cancer research.
