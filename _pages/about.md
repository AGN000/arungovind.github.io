Detail-oriented individual, uniquely educated and experienced in business at the nexus of finance, accounting, and data science/analytics. Exceptionally fast learner, adaptable, and decisive. Straightforward, honest, and articulate communicator. Passionate about scalable, modular, data-driven systems and processes that move the business forward.

In my free time I enjoy acro, weightlifting, yoga, running, reading, and volunteering with [Tech Journey](https://www.techjourney.org/). I'm also an ISSA certified run coach. I live in Iowa with my husband, two alien dogs in cat suits, and dog.
