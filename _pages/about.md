I'm Karthik, a Computer Science MS Student at Texas A&M University. Before Texas A&M I was a Software Engineer at JPMorgan Chase. I graduated from IIT Roorkee with a major in Chemical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. I discovered my love for Computer Graphics while tinkering with Blender in high-school and am looking to get into the entertainment industry using my technical skills. I am now in grad school to pursue my interests in Computer Graphics.

Whenever I'm not working or studying, you'll find me watching movies/tv shows, reading (mostly fiction) or tinkering with Blender.
