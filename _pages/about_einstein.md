Hello, I'm Albert Yoshimoto!

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Texas at El Paso. My background includes a Bachelor's degree in Music Performance from New Mexico State University, where I graduated with honors as a Conroy Scholar. 

My passion lies in both technology and the arts, and I strive to merge my knowledge of computer science with my love for music, composition, and psychology. I have strong leadership and collaborative skills, and I'm eager to contribute to innovative projects that challenge both my technical and creative abilities.

In my free time, you can find me playing the violin, composing music, studying philosophy, or diving into the latest trends in tech and psychology.
