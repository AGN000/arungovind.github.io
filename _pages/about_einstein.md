Hi! 

I'm Zoe Hsu, a second-year Data Science master's student at New York University. My academic journey has fueled my passion for exploring both medical science and cybersecurity fields.

Currently, I'm deeply engaged in pioneering anomaly detection for network flows, employing autoencoders as a machine learning researcher within NYU-IT's HSRN (High-Speed Research Network) department. Excited about the ever-evolving landscape of data science and its real-world applications, I'm committed to pushing boundaries and making meaningful contributions in both medical and cybersecurity domains.
