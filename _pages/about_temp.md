Hello! I'm a PhD candidate in [Brain and Cognitive Sciences](https://bcs.mit.edu/) at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/). I'm advised by [Earl Miller](https://ekmillerlab.mit.edu/earl-miller/) & [Ila Fiete](https://fietelab.mit.edu/), and I work closely with [Leo Kozachkov](https://kozleo.github.io/).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. :sparkle: :brain:
