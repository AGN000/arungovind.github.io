        On June 1st and June 2, 2022, I attended the NSF SaTC PI Meeting at Washington, D.C. I presented our current SaTC project “Privacy protection of Vehicles location in Spatial Crowdsourcing under realistic adversarial models” during the poster session. I had many exciting discussions with other researchers about AI security, data privacy, and cybersecurity!
