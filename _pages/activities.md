        On Juen 1st and June 2, 2022, I attended the NSF SaTC PI Meeting at Washington, D.C. Over 550 participants attended the 2-day long meeting. I presented our current project “Privacy protection of Vehicles location in Spatial Crowdsourcing under realistic adversarial models” during the poster session. I had several exciting in-depth discussions with other researchers about AI security, data privacy, and cybersecurity!
