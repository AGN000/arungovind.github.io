        <b>NSF SaTC PI Meeting 2022 (06/01/2022 -- 06/02/2022)</b> <br><br>
        On June 1st and June 2, 2022, I attended the NSF SaTC PI Meeting in Washington, D.C. I presented some of the research progress made in our current SaTC project  <b>Privacy protection of Vehicles location in Spatial Crowdsourcing under realistic adversarial models</b> during the poster session. I had many exciting discussions with other researchers about data privacy, the security of AI, and cybersecurity!
