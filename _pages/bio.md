I am currently a **Researcher** in the Cognitive Computing Lab at [Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com/) working with [Dr. Ping Li](http://research.baidu.com/People/index-view?id=111) on generative modeling and its applications in Information Retrieval and AI Security. I am also a member of [Prof. Chandan K. Reddy](https://people.cs.vt.edu/reddy)'s lab at VT since 2016. From May 2019 to Feb 2020, I was at [Criteo AI Lab](https://ailab.criteo.com/) in Palo Alto, CA, where I worked with [Dr. Sathiya Keerthi Selvaraj](http://www.keerthis.com/) and Dr. Fengjiao Wang. From 2016 to 2021, I was member of the [Sanghani Center for Artificial Intelligence & Data Analytics](https://sanghani.cs.vt.edu/). Before that, I was a Faculty Research Associate of [Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center](http://essic.umd.edu/) at UMD and also had a joint appointment at [NASA Goddard Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/goddard), where I worked on high-performance and distributed system research. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University](cs.vt.edu), and MS in Computer Science from [University of Maryland, College Park](cs.umd.edu).

<h5>{{ "Research Interests"}}</h5>
My research focuses on understanding the advantages and limitations of generative models and developing practical generative ML models that have low computational complexity and require less human effort.
