    <h1>Find the Lockbox Code as a Group</h1>
    <p>Solve the following problems using Python on your computer. You may not use GenAI to do so, and you must use
        programming to solve the problems-- do not solve by hand.
    </p>
    <p>Once you solve the three problems, use the answers that are printed out as a lockbox code. Go to the front of the
        classroom and use this code on
        the lockbox. If people are waiting, you only have 1 try before going to the back of the line again.
    </p>

    <h2>Problem 1</h2>
    <p> Write a function that takes in an integer (n) and calculates a sequence such that
        the next number is the sum of the square of the previous number's digits (i.e. if n = 157, the next number will
        be 1^2+5^2+7^2 = 1 + 25 + 49 = 75). Repeat this process until n becomes a single-digit number.

    <p><b>RETURN</b> the single-digit number.</p>
    <p><b>Then run your function with an input of n=63946.</b></p>
    </p>

    <p> Code to get you started:</p>
    <pre><code> 
    def sum_of_squared_digits(n):
        sequence = []
        count = 0
        while #REPLACE WITH  YOUR CODE:  # Continue until n becomes a single digit
            sequence.append(n) # Add the current value to the sequence
            #REPLACE WITH YOUR CODE to get the sum of the squares of digits
            #Hint: You can convert the number to a string to access individual digits
            count += 1
        sequence.append(n)  # Add the final single-digit value
        return sequence
    
    sum_of_squared_digits(63946)
    </code></pre>

    <h2>Problem 2</h2>
    <p> Write a function that takes in a list (l) as an argument and calculates a total by going
        through
        the items in the list and:
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Adds any numbers that are even to the total</li>
        <li>Subtracts any numbers that are odd and divisible by 3 to the total</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>RETURN</b> the total.</p>

    <p><b>Then run your function with an input of l =
            [4,6,2,8,4,6,9,3,1,1,1,2,5,4,9,7,12,15,3,0,2,3,9,6,5,10,14,19,15,9,4]</b></p>

    <p> Code to get you started:</p>
    <pre><code> 
    def calculate_total(lst):
        total = 0
        for num in lst:
            if #REPLACE WITH YOUR CODE:  # Add even numbers
                #REPLACE WITH YOUR CODE
            elif #REPLACE WITH YOUR CODE:  # Subtract odd numbers divisible by 3
                #REPLACE WITH YOUR CODE
        return total
    
    l =[4,6,2,8,4,6,9,3,1,1,1,2,5,4,9,7,12,15,3,0,2,3,9,6,5,10,14,19,15,9,4]  
    calculate_total(l)
    </code></pre>

    <h2>Problem 3</h2>
    </p>Write a function that takes in an integer (n) and calculates a sequence of integers using the
    following rules:
    <ol type="1">
        <li>If the number is even, divide it by 2</li>
        <li>If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1</li>
    </ol>

    (This sequence is related to the Collatz Conjecture, which asks whether this sequence will always reach 1 for
    any starting number.)

    <p><b>RETURN</b> the first digit that is less than 10 in the sequence.</p>

    <p><b>Then run your function with an input of n = 703.</b></p>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p> Code to get you started:</p>
    <pre><code> 
    def collatz_sequence(start):
        sequence = [] 
        current = start

        while #REPLACE WITH YOUR CODE:  # Continue until the first digit is less than 10
            sequence.append(current)
            if #REPLACE WITH YOUR CODE:
                #REPLACE WITH YOUR CODE
            else:
                #REPLACE WITH YOUR CODE  # Multiply by 3 and add 1 if odd
        sequence.append(current)  # Add the last value (less than 10) to the sequence
        return sequence
        
    collatz_sequence(703)
    </code></pre>
