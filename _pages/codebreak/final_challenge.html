    <h1>Find the Lockbox Code as a Group</h1>
    <p>Solve the following problems using Python on your computer. You may not use GenAI to do so, and you must use
        programming to solve the problems-- do not solve by hand. Make sure everyone in the group has the code.
    </p>
    <p>Once you do, send one member of the group to the front of the classroom to get the key for the box below. This
        will unlock a page that has three lists on it. Use these lists as input for each of your three solutions, and
        use the answers that are printed out as a lockbox code. Go to the front of the classroom and use this code on
        the lockbox. If people are waiting, you only have 1 try before going to the back of the line again.
    </p>
