I am married to a [social activist masquerading as an economist](www.shekhar.me). Consequently, our Saturday mornings are hours long discussions on the current state of the world.

My [sister](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohanmonali/) is a surgeon in training with a keen focus on rural health systems in developing economies. My [brother](https://ravimohan.net/about/) is a purer scientist than I could ever be.
