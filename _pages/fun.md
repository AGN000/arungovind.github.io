### fam
I am married to a [social activist masquerading as an economist](https://www.shekhar.me). Consequently, our Saturday mornings are hours long discussions on the current state of the world. My [sister](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohanmonali/) is a surgeon in training with a keen focus on rural health systems in developing economies. My [brother](https://ravimohan.net/about/) is a more honest scientist than I could ever be.

### fun
I love to dance and was recently promoted to be a principal dancer for an Indian-American fusion dance company in the Bay area.
