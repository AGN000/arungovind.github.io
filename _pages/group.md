## Openings

### Undergraduate Students
Undergraduate students at OSU who are interested in working with Dr. Cui on
research are encouraged to schedule an appointment by email. To be eligible for
funded opportunities, please reach out by the end of June every year.

### Master's Student Positions
Master's student positions are currently only offered to students who are
enrolled at OSU. Students focusing on power and energy systems, scientific
computing, or software engineering with a strong interest in programming are
encouraged to contact Dr. Cui.

### PhD Student Positions
The Sustainable Energy Systems Laboratory (SENSL) at Oklahoma State University
is accepting applications for one fully funded Ph.D. student for fall 2022. The
successful candidates will work with Prof. Hantao Cui in one of the following
areas in collaboration with national laboratories and industry partners:

1.  Differential-algebraic equations-based modeling, simulation, and control of
    bulk power grids, distribution systems, and microgrids. For this area,
    demonstrable knowledge of power system stability and simulation is required.
    Proficiency in programming is a plus.

2.  High-performance scientific computing and software engineering for power
    systems. For this area, proficiency in one of the following programming
    languages are required: C, C++, MATLAB, Python, or Julia. Knowledge of HPC,
    CUDA, FPGA, or distributed memory systems is a plus.

3.  Machine learning for power system stability, control and operation.
    Knowledge of power system stability and machine learning is required.
    Experience in physics-informed neural networks is strongly desired.

Candidates who *meet the above requirements* with a strong background in power,
control, or computing are required. Candidates with a Master’s degree in related
fields will be given preferences.

*Please send inquiries to Hantao Cui [h.cui@okstate.edu](h.cui@okstate.edu) with your CV,
transcripts, TOEFL/IELTS/GRE scores, and one sample publication if applicable.*
A minimum GPA of 80% and a GRE Analytical Writing score of 3.5 is required.
Also, check out the graduate application process at
https://gradcollege.okstate.edu/application-process/index.html. **All inquiries
will be carefully reviewed. Please understand that due to the high volume of
emails, it is impossible to reply to every inquiry.** Dr. Cui will follow up if
further actions are needed.

Prof. Cui is the author of the power system analysis software ANDES
[https://docs.andes.app](https://docs.andes.app), which is being used worldwide in universities and
laboratories for research. He is presently developing laboratory facilities for
high-performance power systems computing and real-time closed-loop simulation.
For further information regarding research, please see the Sustainable Energy
Systems Laboratory website at [https://sensl.ece.okstate.edu](https://sensl.ece.okstate.edu).

The School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Oklahoma State University
has a history of strong power programs. Students have access to the OSU Pete
Supercomputer and state-of-the-art computing facilities. Oklahoma State
University is in Stillwater, Oklahoma, a safe city of 50,000 residents with
affordable housing of high quality. Stillwater is about 65 miles from two
cosmopolitan cities—Tulsa and Oklahoma City—that are replete with restaurants,
entertainment, museums, sporting events, major airports, and shopping.

Applications for admission in the fall of 2022 are due March 31, 2022.
