## PhD students and Postdocs
<!--
> Up to **four machine learning PhD student or postoc positions** are available at the [Becker Lab](https://bckrlab.org) at the [University of Rostock, Germany](https://www.uni-rostock.de) and can be filled ASAP.
You will join a machine learning group in a beautiful city at the ocean with a strong global network, e.g., including Stanford University, UC San Diego, or UNC Chapel Hill, as well as local expertise providing direct access to world-experts in machine learning, (bio-)medicine, and marine ecology.
This is a unique opportunity for PhD students and postdocs to work in and shape a young and versatile research group that aims to directly impact real-world problem settings in medical as well as environmental settings by developing and applying cutting-edge machine learning methods.
We are particularly passionate about methods to gain deeper insights into the complex systems of the corresponding application domain, domain knowledge integration into machine learning methods, as well as human interaction with existing knowledge. For more details see: https://bckrlab.org/join-us -->

<!-- Our research will cover a wide range of high-impact topics ranging from clinical and bio-medical applications to environmental change and marine ecosystems. -->
<!-- integrating for example experimental biomarkers, single cell data, mental health, physical fitness, immune . -->
<!-- Particular areas of interest include pregnancy and neonatology, physical and biological aging, ... -->
For this we employ a multitude of machine learning approaches ranging from multi-modal learning, deep learning, Bayesian modeling, and exceptional model mining to explainable artificial intelligence, fairness and human computer interaction.

Our group has a strong commitment to translating research to actionable insights and applications with real-world impact and scalability. <!-- We encourage (and financially support) our postdoctoral fellows to receive extensive training in entrepreneurship and business management from Stanfordâ€™s School of Business.  --> This is an excellent environment for candidates who are not only focused on participating in state-of-the-art academic research, but who are also interested in the application of their work with practitioners or in exploring industrial and entrepreneurial avenues.

Diversity across all dimensions is a core value for our lab and a key contributor to our innovative research.
Applicants from groups traditionally underrepresented in computer science and machine learning are strongly encouraged to apply.
