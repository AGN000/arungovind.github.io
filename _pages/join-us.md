**We are hiring!** 👩‍🎓🧑‍🏫👩‍⚕️🙋‍♂️ We are currently looking for **several PhD students, postdocs, and student assistants** with an interest in machine learning.

> The [current call for Postdocs and PhD applications](https://jobs.uni-rostock.de/jobposting/695791729fb8928b74602186ca8fa4f7111bbfc00) is open until **October 15th, 2023**.

**Note** that due to state regulation this particular position needs you to be proficient at speaking German 🇩🇪.


## Our Mission & Values

You will join a machine learning group in a beautiful city by the ocean with a strong global network, including Stanford University, UC San Diego, or UNC Chapel Hill, as well as local expertise. This provides you with direct access and collaborations with world-experts in machine learning, (bio-)medicine, and marine ecology. Joining us will give you the unique opportunity to help us shape a young, highly collaborative, and team-oriented group, that aims to impact real-world problem settings through cutting edge machine learning. We are particularly passionate about methods to understand the underlying processes of complex systems, domain knowledge integration into machine learning methods for accurate modeling, as well as human interaction with existing knowledge. For this we employ a multitude of approaches ranging from multi-modal learning, deep learning, Bayesian modeling, and exceptional model mining to explainable artificial intelligence, fairness, and human computer interaction.

We thrive to create a friendly, supportive, team-oriented, and inclusive work environment with highly motivated colleagues. Diversity across all dimensions is a core value for our lab and a key contributor to our innovative research. Applicants from groups traditionally underrepresented in computer science and machine learning are strongly encouraged to apply.

Our group has a strong commitment to translating research to actionable insights and applications with real-world impact and scalability. This is an excellent environment for candidates who are not only focused on participating in state-of-the-art academic research but are also interested in translating their work in industrial and entrepreneurial avenues.

## Available projects and research directions

Our focus lies on developing and applying cutting-edge machine learning methods in high-impact application scenarios, e.g., in (bio-)medicine and environmental change. The developed methods will, for example, revolve around understanding complex systems by background knowledge extraction end exploitation in the context of the BMBF funded research group [THEMIS](/projects/2022_themis).

## Students

**Come talk to us!** We have many interesting [projects and problem settings](/projects).
Also, if you have **your own project ideas**, don't hesitate to contact us!
We will support you as best as we can!

At the moment, we offer the following topics for a master's thesis:

### Learning Representations of Medical Data with Autoencoders

Medical data usually comprises a lot of features per sample, often distributed across multiple data modalities. Therefore, it becomes necessary to reduce the data's dimensionality to keep noise and model complexity minimal. Autoencoders are a powerful unsupervised learning tool to find efficient encodings. In this project, autoencoders will be applied to high-dimensional multiomics and imaging data to convert them into meaningful fingerprints.

### Integration and Extraction of Background Knowledge with Large Language Models

At least since ChatGPT, everyone has heard of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLM). This project investigates, how LLMs can be utilized in an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) context to integrate/extract background knowledge. Here, background knowledge could for example refer to the intuitive understanding of the problem by a human expert. One suitable approach is given by Knowledge Graphs, which excel at storing structured information.

### Subgroup Discovery in Medical Data

In data mining, subgroup discovery refers to finding interesting subsets within the whole data set with regard to a certain property. In a medical context, a simple (but interpretable) disease prediction model might for example perform mediocre on the overall population, but achieve excellent accuracy on a patient subgroup. Discovering those subgroups would enable the exploitation of simple models for subsets of the population. Subgroup discovery is also related to fairness since a disease prediction model is expected to perform equally well for each patient.

### Clustering of Immune Data

The objective of this project is to find interesting relationships within immunomic data with regard to three axes: horizontal (between features), vertical (between subjects/groups of subjects), and temporal (over time).

### Virtual Reality-based Bibliographic Management

The "method of loci", also known as the "mind palace technique", is a mnemonic device to enhance the recall of information via familiar spatial environments. This project proposes a Virtual Reality-based application for bibliographic management, where scientific papers can be placed and organized in a virtual environment. Another goal is the integration of existing reference management software like Zotero.

### Extraction of traditional flow/mass cytology gates from machine learning models

Flow cytometry and mass cytometry (CyTOF) allow the measurement of multiple biological markers across thousands of cells within each sample. The traditional analysis of single-cell data includes a process referred to as gating, where a domain expert draws a sequence of bounding boxes around cell clusters of interest in 2d plots. Since this procedure is time-consuming and depends on the expert's experience, automatic computation methods have been proposed. However, many machine learning models are hard to interpret, especially for non-domain experts. Therefore, the objective of this project is to extract the traditional gates (bounding boxes) from a trained machine learning model.

### Qualitative Comparison of Attention Maps and Feature Attribution Maps

Since complex Deep Learning models are hard to interpret and regarded as a black box even by domain experts, multiple post-hoc interpretation methods have been proposed. For vision-based models, those methods are often generally referred to as Saliency Maps, which compute a heatmap of importance over the pixel space. Transformer-based models utilize the attention mechanism, where the model learns the relevance of the input features during training. This project aims to compare attribution maps of post-hoc interpretation maps with attention maps from transformer-based models and investigate their theoretical relationship.
