**We are hiring!** 👩‍🎓🧑‍🏫👩‍⚕️🙋‍♂️ We are currently looking for **several PhD students, postdocs, and student assistants** with an interest in machine learning.

> The [current call for Postdocs and PhD applications](https://jobs.uni-rostock.de/jobposting/695791729fb8928b74602186ca8fa4f7111bbfc00) is open until **October 31, 2023**.

**Note** that due to state regulation this particular position needs you to be proficient at speaking German 🇩🇪.

## Our Mission and Values

You will join a machine learning group in a beautiful city by the ocean with a strong global network, including Stanford University, UC San Diego, or UNC Chapel Hill, as well as local expertise. This provides you with direct access and collaborations with world-experts in machine learning, (bio-)medicine, and marine ecology. Joining us will give you the unique opportunity to help us shape a young, highly collaborative, and team-oriented group, that aims to impact real-world problem settings through cutting edge machine learning. We are particularly passionate about methods to understand the underlying processes of complex systems, domain knowledge integration into machine learning methods for accurate modeling, as well as human interaction with existing knowledge. For this we employ a multitude of approaches ranging from multi-modal learning, deep learning, Bayesian modeling, and exceptional model mining to explainable artificial intelligence, fairness, and human computer interaction.

We thrive to create a friendly, supportive, team-oriented, and inclusive work environment with highly motivated colleagues. Diversity across all dimensions is a core value for our lab and a key contributor to our innovative research. Applicants from groups traditionally underrepresented in computer science and machine learning are strongly encouraged to apply.

Our group has a strong commitment to translating research to actionable insights and applications with real-world impact and scalability. This is an excellent environment for candidates who are not only focused on participating in state-of-the-art academic research but are also interested in translating their work in industrial and entrepreneurial avenues.

Our focus lies on developing and applying cutting-edge machine learning methods in high-impact application scenarios, e.g., in (bio-)medicine and environmental change. The developed methods will, for example, revolve around understanding complex systems by background knowledge extraction end exploitation in the context of the BMBF funded research group [THEMIS](/projects/2022_themis). Nevertheless, we are always interested in your own project ideas, thus, don’t hesitate to contact us! We will support you as best as we can.
