A collection of life advice that resonates with me from sources I admire, in case you find it useful:
- **Embrace both your incredible freedom and heavy responsibility.** You must create your own meaning and choose who to become in every moment. In doing so, you define humanity.
    - [Jean-Paul Sartre](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51985.Existentialism_is_a_Humanism): "Existentialism puts every man in possession of himself as he is and places the entire responsibility for his existence squarely upon his own shoulders. Of all the actions a man may take to create himself as he wills to be, there is not one which is not creative, at the same time, of an image of man such as he believes he ought to be. Man is condemned at every instant to invent man."
    - [Simone de Beauvoir](https://theophilegervet.github.io/book_notes/the-ethics-of-ambiguity/): "From the very beginning, existentialism defined itself as a philosophy of ambiguity. To declare that existence is absurd is to deny that it can ever be given a meaning; to say that it is ambiguous is to assert that its meaning is never fixed, that it must be constantly won."
- **Work towards a cause you believe in.** Currently, I believe that creating knowledge is the primary driver of human progress, and we have the opportunity to dramatically accelerate this process with AI in our lifetimes. What do you believe in?
    - [David Deutsch](https://theophilegervet.github.io/book_notes/the-beginning-of-infinity/): "The ability to create and use explanatory knowledge gives people a power to transform nature which is ultimately not limited by parochial factors, as all other adaptations are, but only by universal laws. This is the cosmic significance of explanatory knowledge – and hence of people.", "If humanity fails at anything, it will be because of a failure to create knowledge."
- **Aim for great work.** Think big and take risks. Not only is it allowable but it is cowardly not to. The gain is in the struggle and not the achievement itself.
    - [Richard Hamming](https://theophilegervet.github.io/book_notes/the-art-of-doing-science-and-engineering/): "I have to get you to drop modesty and say to yourself 'Yes, I would like to do first-class work.' Our society frowns on people who set out to do really good work. You're not supposed to; luck is supposed to descend on you and you do great things by chance. Well, that's a kind of dumb thing to say. I say, why shouldn't you set out to do something significant. You don't have to tell other people, but shouldn't you say to yourself, 'Yes, I would like to do something significant.'"
    - [Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful): "I always want to work on a project that, if successful, will make the rest of my career look like a footnote.", "If you are making progress on an important problem, you will have a constant tailwind of people wanting to help you. Let yourself grow more ambitious, and don’t be afraid to work on what you really want to work on."
    - [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html): "If you don't try to be the best, you won't even be good.", "Take as much risk as you can afford. In an efficient market, risk is proportionate to reward, so don't look for certainty, but for a bet with high expected value. If you're not failing occasionally, you're probably being too conservative."
    - [Ray Dalio](https://theophilegervet.github.io/book_notes/principles/): "If you limit your goals to what you know you can achieve, you are setting the bar way too low."
    - [Andrej Karpathy](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/): "A 10x more important problem is at most 2-3x harder to achieve. In fact, in some cases a 10x harder problem may be easier to achieve. Thinking 10x forces you out of the box, to confront the real limitations of an approach, to think from first principles, to change the strategy completely, to innovate."
- **Nurture and follow your curiosity.** Explore what energizes you and let it drive you. Your curiosity is your main source of motivation and your best guide towards important problems. Protect it like a living organism. You can learn anything you’re curious about. 
    - [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html): "Your curiosity never lies, and it knows more than you do about what's worth paying attention to. If you asked an oracle the secret to doing great work and the oracle replied with a single word, my bet would be on curiosity.", "Husband your morale. It's the basis of everything when you're working on ambitious projects. You have to nurture and protect it like a living organism.", "Stop occasionally and ask yourself: Am I working on what I most want to work on?”
    - [Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful): "The most successful people I know are primarily internally driven; they do what they do to impress themselves and because they feel compelled to make something happen in the world."
    - [Naval Ravikant](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936): "Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage. Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion. Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others."
- **Put in hard work.** Not only is work stamina the only path to being the best, but you are most happy when deeply committed. Avoid burnout by doing work you enjoy with people you enjoy working with.
    - [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html): "Four steps to great work: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier, notice gaps, explore promising ones. Steps two and four will require hard work. It may not be possible to prove that you have to work hard to do great things, but the empirical evidence is on the scale of the evidence for mortality."
    - [Richard Hamming](https://theophilegervet.github.io/book_notes/the-art-of-doing-science-and-engineering/): "Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest. Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works ten percent more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity."
    - [Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful): "You can get to about the 90th percentile in your field by working either smart or hard, which is still a great accomplishment. But getting to the 99th percentile requires both—you will be competing with other very talented people who will have great ideas and be willing to work a lot. Extreme people get extreme results. As in most cases, momentum compounds, and success begets success."
- **Develop your vision.**
    - [Richard Hamming](https://theophilegervet.github.io/book_notes/the-art-of-doing-science-and-engineering/): "Having a vision is what tends to separate the leaders from the followers.", "For many years, I devoted 10% of my time (Friday afternoons) to trying to understand what would happen in the future of computing thinking about: What is possible? What is likely to happen? What is desirable to have happen?"
    - [Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful): "Learn to think independently. Entrepreneurship is very difficult to teach because original thinking is very difficult to teach. You have to cultivate it on your own."
- **Learn to communicate your vision.**
    - [Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful): "All great careers, to some degree, become sales jobs. You have to evangelize your plans to customers, prospective employees, the press, investors, etc. This requires an inspiring vision, strong communication skills, some degree of charisma, and evidence of execution ability."
    - [Richard Hamming](https://theophilegervet.github.io/book_notes/the-art-of-doing-science-and-engineering/): "The duty of a great scientist is not only to find new things but to communicate them successfully in at least three forms: writing papers and books, prepared public talks, and impromptu talks."
- **Once you picked a problem, focus.**
    - [Richard Hamming](https://theophilegervet.github.io/book_notes/the-art-of-doing-science-and-engineering/): "The way to manage yourself is that when you have a real important problem you don't let anything else get the center of your attention. Keep your subconscious starved so it has to work on your problem, so you can sleep peacefully and get the answer in the morning, free."
    - [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html): "Great work usually entails spending what would seem to most people an unreasonable amount of time on a problem."
- **Master the fundamentals and learn to learn.**
    - [Richard Hamming](https://theophilegervet.github.io/book_notes/the-art-of-doing-science-and-engineering/): "Knowledge increases exponentially, roughly doubling every 17 years. You must concentrate on fundamentals and develop the ability to learn new fields of knowledge when they arise."
- **Seek out the best colleagues.** The most effective way to learn any craft is by working with the best at this craft. The best colleagues challenge and surprise you.
    - [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html): "Quality is more important than quantity in colleagues. It's better to have one or two great ones than a building full of pretty good ones.", "Sufficiently good colleagues offer surprising insights. They can see and do things that you can't."
- **Build long-term relationships.** Make time to meet and help forces of nature. 
    - [Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful): "Great work requires teams. The size of the network of really talented people you know often becomes the limiter for what you can accomplish. An effective way to build a network is to help people as much as you can.", "I try to always ask myself when I meet someone new 'is this person a force of nature?' It’s a pretty good heuristic for finding people who are likely to accomplish great things."
- **Cultivate almost too much self-belief.** Believing in yourself is necessary to have contrarian ideas about the future and convincing others. Build self-belief by getting things done. Balance self-belief with self-awareness by carefully listening to criticism. 
    - [Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful): "Managing your own morale — and your team’s morale — is one of the greatest challenges of most endeavors. It’s almost impossible without a lot of self-belief. And unfortunately, the more ambitious you are, the more the world will try to tear you down.", "One of the most powerful lessons to learn is that you can figure out what to do in situations that seem to have no solution. The more times you do this, the more you will believe it."
    - [Richard Hamming](https://theophilegervet.github.io/book_notes/the-art-of-doing-science-and-engineering/): "Once you get your courage up and believe that you can do important problems, then you can. If you think you can't, almost surely you are not going to."
- **Be willful.**
    - [Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful): "A big secret is that you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time — most people don’t even try, and just accept that things are the way that they are.", "Almost always, the people who say 'I am going to keep going until this works, and no matter what the challenges are I’m going to figure them out', and mean it, go on to succeed."
- **Be hard to compete with by building leverage.**
    - [Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful): "The best way to become difficult to compete with is to build up leverage. For example, you can do it with personal relationships, by building a strong personal brand, or by getting good at the intersection of multiple different fields."
    - [Naval Ravikant](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936): "Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media). Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement."
- **Be radically open-minded.** Seek ideas and feedback that contradict your view of the world and yourself.
    - [Ray Dalio](https://theophilegervet.github.io/book_notes/principles/): "The most important thing I learned is an approach to life based on thoughtful disagreement, in which the goal is not to convince the other party that you are right—but rather to find out which view is true and decide what to do about it.", "Find the most believable people possible who disagree with you and try to understand their reasoning. This is the quickest way to learn and to increase your probability of being right."
    - [Richard Hamming](https://theophilegervet.github.io/book_notes/the-art-of-doing-science-and-engineering/): "Regularly ask about your most deeply held beliefs: Why do I believe what I do? What evidence would I accept to be proven wrong?"
- **Be radically transparent.**
    - [Ray Dalio](https://theophilegervet.github.io/book_notes/principles/): "Understanding what is true is essential for success, and being radically transparent about everything, including mistakes and weaknesses, helps create the understanding that leads to improvements."
- **Embrace failure as a tool for growth.**
    - [Ray Dalio](https://theophilegervet.github.io/book_notes/principles/): "If you’re not failing, you’re not pushing your limits, and if you’re not pushing your limits, you’re not maximizing your potential.", "Pain + Reflection = Progress"
- **Embrace accountability.**
    - [Naval Ravikant](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936): "Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage."
- **Focus on what you can control.** The process, not the outcome. Internalize your goals. Compare yourself only to your past self.
    - [Marcus Aurelius](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30659.Meditations): "You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."
