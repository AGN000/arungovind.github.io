  Finished setting up my website and applying to a fellowship. Reviewed Math 626 material, worked out all of the assignment besides Q.1., which seems to be presenting issues.

  Outside of a day full of classes and talks, spent about 3 hours ironing out Q.1., which proved to be non-trivial, and discovered an error in my solution to Q.4. Eventually talked to a student who said they saw the first passage decomposition being used in Q.4, which worked out very nicely. Read about some practical issues with RL research to mentally prepare myself before launching back into reading Sutton/Barto and following Silver's RL course.
