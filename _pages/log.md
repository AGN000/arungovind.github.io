  Finished setting up my website and applying to a fellowship. Reviewed Math 626 material, worked out all of the assignment besides Q.1., which seems to be presenting issues.

  Outside of a day full of classes and talks, spent about 3 hours ironing out Q.1., which proved to be non-trivial, and discovered an error in my solution to Q.4. Eventually talked to a student who said they saw the first passage decomposition being used in Q.4, which worked out very nicely. Read about some practical issues with RL research to mentally prepare myself before launching back into reading Sutton/Barto and following Silver's RL course.

  Wrote up and submitted my assignment, attended Math 626. We constructed the stationary distribution for an irreducible Markov chain with a positively recurrent state. Started talking about periods of Markov chains and aperiodic Makrov chains. Completed Chapter 3 of Sutton/Barto and reviewed chapter 2, added my questions to Workflowy. Alekh Agarwal et al's RL book seems way more mathematically sound and attractive. Once I get a general overview of things from Sutton/Barto and Silver, I'll go to that book.

  Corrected mistakes in my assignment, almost finished the Math 597 assignment due next week. Read part of Rishi Sonthalia's TreeRep paper. Love how they're leveraging the finite combinatorial possiblities in a tree stemming from Gromov products! Will finish this over the weekend. Read a bulk of chapter 1 of the AJKS RL theory book, finished chapter 4 of Sutton/Barto and went through some of chapter 5. Glanced at Chen and Poor's paper on learning mixture's of linear dynamical systems sample efficiently, which seems like a fun problem!
