Life as a scientist is incredibly rewarding - I often think that I am being paid to indulge in a hobby. Being able to see the frontier of human knowledge is an exhilarating feeling.  

I am committed to supporting students as they explore science as a profession. I will be happy to meet with you and chat about being a scientist, what can you do to be a successful one, and academic life in general. Sometimes, I also advise research projects in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) that align with me research and personal interests.

If you are a student (especially in a developing part of the world) and would like to talk, please [email](mailto:shiwali.mohan@gmail.com) me with a brief description of who you are and why you would like to pursue a profession in science. As my expertise is in AI and ML, I am most comfortable discussing that space. I speak Hindi and English fluently.

I am firm believer in equitable science and want support people from diverse backgrounds in accessing scientific and technology spaces. Scientific enquiry is most productive when the researchers are drawn from a variety of cultures and experiences. Diversity expands the frontier of human knowledge we are exploring as a community - people from varying backgrounds are motivated to study different problems. Additionally, diversity ensures that the fruits of effort are accessible to and benefit a greater portion of humanity.
