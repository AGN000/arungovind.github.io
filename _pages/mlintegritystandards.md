### ML Integrity Themes

The following is a breakdown, at a high level, of the five different themes that make up ML Integrity.

**Model Performance:** Is the model performing well?<br>
**Fairness:** Is the model being used in a way that is not biased?<br>
**Security:** Is the model secure against adversaries?<br>
**Data Quality:** Is the data used in the model of high quality?<br>
**Transparency:** Does everyone in the organization have visibility into the model?



### ML Lifecycle

The following is a breakdown, at a high level, of the three different stages of the ML lifecycle.

**Data Transformation:** Gathering raw data and labels, transforming into a format suitable for machine learning.<br>
**Model Development:** Training of models, experimentation on model hyperparameters, analyzing and validating models before deployment.<br>
**Model Operationalization:** Deployment of models into production, making sure those models do not degrade overtime.
