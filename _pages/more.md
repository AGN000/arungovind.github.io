I enjoy salsa/bachata, origami, reading (fiction/poetry/creative non-fiction), solving linguistics puzzles, thinking about film production, wordling/quordling/whatever else there is, group-solving crosswords.

## Origami 

Here's my first Kusudama from 2018!

## Reading 

This list will grow as I remember books and poetry I enjoyed.

<details>
  <summary> We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves</summary>
  Karen Joy Fowler's exploration of memory and the psyche in a wonderfully written maybe-family-drama that squarely avoids whatever trope you had in mind. The novel has a rich and syrupy but sharp undertone, and while the ending felt a bit forced in parts, it still leaves a lasting memory. The writing is immersive and easy-going, at times almost lyrical. A must-read for people who want a fresh voice.

  <summary>The Interpreter of Maladies</summary>
  Jhumpa Lahiri probably became my favourite author once I read A Temporary Matter. While I found the quality of the stories in the book quite variable, the first one is a revelation. Lahiri has mastered the use of restraint, lingering on just the right small gestures to create big ripples in her stories. These are the moments which in retrospect we have experienced too, but probably never consciously recognized until she unveiled them. She has done what great authors do - unmask us to ourselves. And she has done it the way the Earth spins under our feet - not violently, but powerfully.

  <summary> Autobiography of Red </summary>
  Anne Carson was my favourite poet for a very long time. She masters the balance between otherworldly poetry and grounding narration. Geryon's childhood has so many moments I automatically imagine tinged in sepia light. She models Geryon as a symbol for otherness but makes it an intensely relatable brand of otherness, in what Sam Anderson calls her classic "Carsonian distant closeness."
