> I think the point of cinematography, of what we do, is intimacy. Is intent, is the balance between the familiar and the dream, it is being subjective and objective, it is being engaged and yet standing back and noticing something that perhaps other people didnâ€™t notice before, or celebrating something that you feel is beautiful or valid, or true or engaging in some way.
