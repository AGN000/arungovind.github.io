<h4 class='music-title'><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z98l9LYjrKE'>A Very Washlava Christmas (LG Washer/Dryer Tune)</a></h4>
While jamming with friends instead of studying for upcoming finals, we transcribed the tune that emanated from our beloved dorm-basement IoT-enabled washers and dryers. I was in a particularly festive mood one day and decided to arrange it as a Christmas tune and accompany the music with some pretty terrible video editing... <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z98l9LYjrKE'>enjoy</a>!

<h4 class='music-title'>Cottonwood Theme & Variations</h4>
I composed a theme & 4 variations for the piano as a student in Harmony & Counterpoint II. It's named after the cottonwood (the state tree of Kansas), incorporating feelings of nostalgia and memories from my childhood. Below is a recording of it performed by <a href='https://www.elainekwon.com/'>Elain Kwon</a>!

<h4 class='music-title'>Cottonwood Rag</h4>
My very first piece was written in a Ragtime Composition class - I composed it without much music theory knowledge, so had quite the adventure trying to distill the spirit of Scott Joplin into a rag without knowing my Roman Numerals... enjoy this recording performed by <a href='https://mta.mit.edu/person/charles-shadle'>Professor Charles Shadle</a>!
