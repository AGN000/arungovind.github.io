## Gas dynamics and dark matter in dwarf galaxies

The lowest-mass, 'dwarf' galaxies have large dark-to-total matter ratios, making them excellent objects to study dark matter {% cite 2016MNRAS.457.1931S %}. In this studentship, you will use a combination of galaxy formation simulations and <nobr>21-cm</nobr> radio observations of atomic hydrogen gas in dwarf galaxies to discriminate between candidates for the particle making up the dark matter.

The orbital speed of a particle in a gravitational field is dictated by the mass distribution within its orbit. Measurements of the orbital speed of stars or gas in galaxies as a function of orbital radius - rotation curves - therefore let us map out the total mass distribution in a galaxy. Subtracting an estimate of the visible mass distribution leaves the dark matter distribution. It is a generic prediction of the standard Î› cold dark matter cosmology that the centres of galaxies should have very high dark matter densities. The rotation curves of many dwarf galaxies, however, are consistent with much lower central densities. This is a long-standing discrepancy {% cite 2015MNRAS.452.3650O %} that could signal a need for additional dark-sector physics, such as a scattering interaction between dark matter particles, but could also be a symptom of limitations in our astrophysical theories of galaxy formation or our ability to model observational data to produce rotation curves.

Our group has recently obtained computing time for a large suite of simulations using the brand-new Colibre galaxy formation model that is ideally suited to make predictions for the gas dynamics in dwarf galaxies. We are also members of [WALLABY](https://wallaby-survey.org/) and [MHONGOOSE](https://mhongoose.astron.nl/), two of a new generation of <nobr>21-cm</nobr> radio surveys at pathfinder observatories for the forthcoming [Square Kilometer Array Observatory](https://www.skao.int/en). This is a powerful combination that will allow you to make detailed theoretical predictions and test them against new datasets during your studentship. You may choose to focus on theory by learning to run and analyse your own simulations, or you could focus on modelling observations {% cite 2019MNRAS.482..821O %} and developing new statistical methods. In either case, the question 'how can we reliably identify those dwarf galaxies that tell us the most about dark matter?' will help guide your project.

This studentship is funded by the Royal Society and includes independent allowances for travel, equipment and skills development.
