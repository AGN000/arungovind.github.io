* ***Cognition Long Time after Weather Shocks in China*** (JMP)
<div style="text-align: justify"> Abstract: Relying on detailed health, agriculture, and weather data in China from 1907 to 2016, this paper analyzes the relationship between weather shocks endured during early life and cognition functions measured after 40 years old. Although vast literature documented weather shocks' effects on health and human capital in early life, evidence in the long run, from early childhood to adulthood and old age, is much more limited. Thanks to a specific shock measurement method based on predicted variation of crop yields and the timing of weather shock in early childhood, I disentangle mechanisms at stake. Results confirm existing research on the crucial time of prenatal period and point out how the following period, from birth to 15 years old, also contributes to long-term cognitive functions. Excessive rainfall endured from prenatal to 4 years old negatively impacts cognitive development, primarily through its detrimental effects on health. The detrimental effect of weather shocks from 5 to 15 years old on long-term cognition is mainly driven by positive shocks on yields, reducing school attendance. </div>
