* ***Cognition Long Time after Weather Shocks in China*** (JMP)
<div style="text-align: justify"> Abstract: Relying on detailed health, agriculture, and weather data in China from 1921 to 2020, this paper analyzes the relationship between weather shocks endured from \textit{in utero} to 15 years old and dimensions of human capital, in particular, cognitive functions, measured after the age of forty. Although an extensive body of literature has documented the effects of weather shocks on health and human capital in early life, long-term evidence, from infancy to adulthood and old age, is much more limited. Additionally, the effects of shocks during the period from 5 to 15 years old remain largely unexplored. By employing a specific shock measurement method, which is based on the predicted variation of crop yields and the timing of weather shocks in early childhood, I unravel the underlying mechanisms, focusing especially on an agricultural channel. The results demonstrate the contribution of the period from birth to 15 years old to long-term cognitive functions, highlighting that the \textit{in utero} period has a comparatively smaller effect. Experiencing an additional extreme weather event from birth to 4 years old is associated with a reduction in cognition scores by 0.029 standard deviations. Additionally, I disclose that in areas experiencing poor crop production, the impact of beneficial yield shocks actually lowers cognitive scores, whereas in areas of high crop production, these shocks improve cognitive scores. This indicates a trade-off between agricultural labor and educational investment. This trade-off is especially harmful for girls, who are more likely to decrease their school attendance as crop yields rise due to weather shocks. </div>
