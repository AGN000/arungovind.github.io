* In my undergraduate career at Cornell I was involved with the National Society of Black Engineers, CU Image and Women in Computing at Cornell. 

* I am from Memphis, Tennessee and enjoy visiting my friends and family in the area.

* I enjoy listening to music, cooking, and taking walks around Ithaca. 

* I plan to begin working in data science & analytics in the bay area this fall.
