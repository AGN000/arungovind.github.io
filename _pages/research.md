<h3>Research Interests</h3>


Broadly, I am interested in developing (often Bayesian) methodology that improve inferential precision in analyses with data obtained from multiple groups or sources. I am particularly interested in settings with small to moderate group-level sample sizes. My recent work has been related to covariance estimation, small area estimation, conformal prediction, and bayesian methods.
