<h2> Euclidean Geometry Materials </h2>
</div>
  
Along the last five years, I have come up with several notes on Euclidean Geometry problem-solving strategies, 
aimed at students preparing for international mathematical contests. All of these documents have been written in Spanish. 
I do not intend, at least in the short term, to translate these handouts into English (there is already a profuse number of English-written materials
out there). From my standpoint, one of the main reasons behind Central-American countries' poor performance in high-level competitions
is the lack of adequate training resources in Spanish. I hope these notes prove useful for olympiad enthusiasts, 
especially those from these countries.
