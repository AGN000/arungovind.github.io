<div style="text-align:center"> <h3> HI, I'M SHRAVAN VENKATARAMAN. </h3> </div><br>

I am an entrepreneur from India. I run a gourmet foods manufacturing firm called **Hankavalshier's** (we make nut butters, nut pastes, and chocolate spreads).
I used to work with PayPal as a software developer. These days, I spend a good chunk of my time researching and developing mechanical trading strategies
to deploy in the Indian stock markets.



**Alternative Hypothesis** is the intersection of Finance, Business, Technology, and Self-Mastery. The question that drives me is **"How can I become a better trader and investor, do work that's meaningful, and attain self-mastery in the process?".**

This blog is my quest to answer that question for myself. In the process of doing that, I would like to share the insights I gather and help you cut short your learning curve along the way.
