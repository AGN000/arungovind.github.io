## if you plant to apply for a PhD (and work with me)

* I am currently hiring students with a background in parallel programming and interest in high-performance computing for computational sciences. If you think we might be a good fit, please contact me via email and I will be happy to talk with you. However, please note that the admissions process goes through [Cornell CIS](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/phd/admissions) and not through me personally.

* A good introductory email should include a brief description of your experience with parallel programming and how it relates to my work (see [research section](https://giuliaguidi.github.io/research/) on my website); also include the sentence "mantua me genuit" in the email.

Thank you for your interest, best of luck.

## useful resources for (prospective) students

Under construction.

* [Cornell CS student-applicant support program](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/information/news/newsitem12443/student-applicant-support-program-computer-science-phd). You may apply to this program to receive feedback on your application before submitting it to Cornell CS. You must submit a form by October 7, 2022 to participate, and then submit your application material by November 4, 2022 (both are required).
* [A doc with advice related to graduate school application](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1et1FK4_GlAZrxd7JoPzfqcLAZh_9sOm7HMov_hDGo98/preview?pli=1) (I wrote as a graduate student at UCB, but it generally applies to any research university).
* [A repository with advice related to graduate school application, research, and PhD related to (mostly) CS, NLP, and ML](https://github.com/shaily99/advice).
* [A curated list of application resources for prospective graduate students in Computer Science](https://github.com/chinasaokolo/csGraduateApps).
* [Non-Technical Talks by David Patterson, UC Berkeley](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pattrsn/talks/nontech.html).
