## if you plant to apply for a PhD (and work with me)

* Please note that the admission process is through [Cornell CIS](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/phd/admissions) and not through me personally. The decision will be made by a committee, but if you are interested in my work, please feel free to email me (see below).

* I'm interested in students with background and strong research interest in High-Performance Computing and Parallel Programming and Systems research; interest in Computatational Sciences (e.g., Computational Biology) is a plus.

* To express interest in my work, you would need to show that you:
  * have an idea of what I do;
  * have some background in parallel computing;
  * that my work is of interest to you; and
  * include the sentence "mantua me genuit" somewhere random in the email.
