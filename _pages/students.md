## if you plant to apply for a PhD (and work with me)

* I am currently hiring students with a background in parallel programming and interest in high-performance computing for computational sciences. If you think we might be a good fit, please contact me via email and I will be happy to talk with you. However, please note that the admissions process goes through [Cornell CIS](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/phd/admissions) and not through me personally.

* A good introductory email should include a brief description of your experience with parallel programming and how it relates to my work (see [research section](https://giuliaguidi.github.io/research/) on my website); also include the sentence "mantua me genuit" in the email.

Thank you for your interest, best of luck.
