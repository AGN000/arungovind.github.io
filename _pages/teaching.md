description: Philosophy teaches valuable lessons in argument formation, respectful disagreement, and epistemic humility. My aim as an instructor is to guide students as they develop into better critical thinkers and to encourage self-reflection, charitable reconstruction of opposing views, and careful argumentation.

<h3>Ethics and Politics of Technology</h3>
        with Marta Halina

   <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        In a talk at the University of Cambridge in 2016, Stephen Hawking said, "The rise of powerful AI will be either the best, or the worst thing, ever to happen to humanity. We do not yet know which". The increasing power and pervasiveness of artificially intelligent systems raises numerous important philosophical questions: Is technology value neutral? Do artefacts have politics? Is automated decision-making fair? When developing AI, should we aim for transparency over accuracy? This course covers core topics in the ethics and politics of technology through the lens of questions raised by contemporary advances in AI.

        Part IB History and Philosophy of Science is a year-long course that offers a wide-ranging overview of the nature of science and its place in society. The philosophical portion of the course covers issues such as how to characterize scientific method, the reliability of induction, the nature and status of objectivity in science, and the complex inter-relationships between scientific research and social values. We will also touch on philosophical issues in specific fields of science, including biology, medicine, cognitive science, and the social sciences.
