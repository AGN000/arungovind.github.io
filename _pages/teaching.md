This was my first time creating a website using Jekyll and GitHub Pages. Once you learn the commands for Jekyll, it is very easy to locally run and test your site. Jekyll templates also make it very easy to add stuff quickly to your site using markdown files. GitHub Pages makes it easy to run your site staticly for anyone to access..
