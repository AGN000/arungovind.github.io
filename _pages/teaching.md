In 2023 [James Bartlett](https://github.com/jamesdbartlett3) and I co-taught a course for Tech Journey's Tech Camp we called Data Analysis & Visualization Using Python. After discussing how we wanted the course to flow, I developed the course materials from a coding perspective and James handled the back-end set-up, including testing for access from Google Chromebooks (the standard issue for students at Tech Journey) versus other computers, as some students choose to bring and use their own computers. Together, we co-taught this course to give students a brief introduction to how to think about visualizations (visualization type, color, labeling, etc.) and how they can use Python to investigate their data and ultimately create visuals. The course material can be found on the `_repositories` page, or you can access it directly [here](https://github.com/likeawednesday/TechCamp_DataViz).
