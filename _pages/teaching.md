## University of Michigan 
1. Math 116, Winter 2022.
2. Math 115, Fall 2021.

## Monsoon Math Camp 
1. <details>
  <summary> Geometry, Symmetry and Hyperbolic Space, 2020 </summary>
  Description: Exposure to a lot of Euclidean geometry may create the impression that higher geometry is the study of generalized distance spaces. This course will try to convince participants that in some cases, a better view of geometry is the interaction between a space and its group of transformations, via material on elementary hyperbolic geometry. We will see basic results in hyperbolic geometry, the hyperbolic Gauss-Bonnet Theorem, the Iwasawa decomposition, a quick version of material on Fuchsian groups and quotienting, and if time permits, the Milnor-Svarc lemma.

Prerequisites: High School Calculus and High School Matrices.
  
Verdict: The course was one of the more challenging ones at camp, but students still seemed to engage with the lectures.
