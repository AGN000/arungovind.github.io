- **Introduction to Linguistics, Fall 2021** (Undergrad)
  - As a TA, I conducted weekly tutorial sessions to reinforce the subjects covered in class. We explored various aspects of linguistics, including syntax, semantics, phonology, and more.

- **Forensic Linguistics, Winter 2022** (Undergrad)
  - In this online class, I attended lectures and facilitated student discussions through Zoom rooms. I assisted students in solving and discussing problems assigned by the professor.

- **Phonetics, Fall 2022** (Undergrad)
  - As a TA, I conducted two tutorial sessions per week for approximately 50 students. We reviewed class materials and worked on weekly assignments. I also provided instruction on using PRAAT to help students doing their final project.

- **Semantics, Winter 2023** (Undergrad)
  - Being my area of expertise, I was thrilled to TA for Semantics. Although tutorial sessions were not required, I held two sessions to review class materials with the 80 students. This experience allowed me to explore semantics from the students' perspective and was incredibly enjoyable. I was nominated for the **outstanding TA award** at Carleton University for this course.
