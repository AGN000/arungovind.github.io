## services

I am (proudly) a co-chair of the **Equal Access to Application Assistance (EAAA) program** at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley. EAAA is a student-led program designed to ensure that all applicants to higher degree programs (MS/Ph.D.) in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley have access to guidance on the application process for advanced degrees. A current (or recent) graduate of the EECS department will provide feedback on application materials, resume, CV, and other application materials each fall prior to the higher degree application deadlines. **You can apply to EAAA [here]()**. You can find additional **resources on how to apply to grad school** on my co-chair's website, [Nathan Lambert](https://www.natolambert.com/), **click [here](https://www.natolambert.com/guides/grad-apps)**.
