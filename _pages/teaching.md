* **Applications of Statistical Methods in Business (ADM 2304)**

ADM 2304 presents the conceptual, intuitive, and computational basis of statistical data analysis, with emphasis on applications to business, public, and non-profit sector problems. It provides fundamental tools for thinking critically about problems with words, numbers, and graphs. Topics include estimation and hypothesis testing (including nonparametric methods), chi-square methods for categorical data, one- and two-way analyses of variance, and simple and multiple regression modelling. ADM 2304 provides the necessary background for more advanced quantitative courses in operations management, simulation, data mining, market research, econometrics, and forecasting.
