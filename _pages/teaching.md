My teaching experience started at Harvard University as a teaching
assistant in the [Department of Physics](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/),
where [Arthur Jaffe](https://www.arthurjaffe.com/) hired me after auditing
his courses on classical mechanics and mathematics of modern physics.

Subsequently, I continued as a teaching assistant at Nanyang Technological
University (NTU) in the
[School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms)
(SPMS) during my tenure as a PhD student in mathematics.
