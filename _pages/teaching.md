Conveying science effectively and persuasively to the general public is vital.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been an eye-opening testament to this -- where lack of understanding in the dynamic scientific progress perpetuated the public health crisis.  

I created easy-to-understand animated explainer videos, the most notable of which are COVID-19 explainer videos commissioned by multiple departments at Yale. Some are featured below:
