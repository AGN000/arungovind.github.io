In 2021-2022, I had fun preparing and teaching the exercise sessions of [Machine Learning for Physicists](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/machine-learning-for-physicists-PHYS-467) (taught by Lenka Zdeborova) and teaching PyTorch and deep learning theory in the fall semester of the [Physics Projects](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sb/sph/en/master/master-in-physics/physics-projects-master-in-physics/) in biological and complex systems physics.

In 2022-2023, I'm teaching the exercise sessions of the second edition of [Machine Learning for Physicists](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/machine-learning-for-physicists-PHYS-467).
