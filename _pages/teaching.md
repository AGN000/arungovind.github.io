***This page is currently a WORK IN PROGRESS. Here I will be uploading some materials that I have developed for the below mentioned courses as well as those developed for various other workshops etc.. I also plan to host a landing page here for a tutorial series that I am putting together on the coordinated use of open-source software in commerical engineering enterprises.***
