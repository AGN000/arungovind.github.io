I believe that conveying science effectively and persuasively to the general public is just as important, if not more important, to do the research itself. Scientific efforts and progress are only useful to society if findings are accessible, understood, and acted upon accordingly. The COVID-19 pandemic has been an eye-opening testament to this -- where lack of understanding in the dynamic scientific progress perpetuated the public health crisis.  

I created easy-to-understand animated explainer videos, the most notable of which are COVID-19 explainer videos commissioned by multiple departments at Yale. Some are featured below
