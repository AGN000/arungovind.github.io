CUPE 2278		September 2022 – August 2023
Contracted Community Organizer
•	Executive member of the Engineering Organizing Unit Committee and an active contributor to the Data and Mapping Unit Committee, 2 units in Canada's single largest (successful) union drive in modern history.
•	Our filing for automatic recognition garnered the majority support of a student body comprising over 8,000 individuals. My focus was specifically on organizing the second largest body of UBC’s graduate students (engineers and applied scientists) ~1200 students. 

United Way T&T		March 2020 – August 2020
Part-Time Organizational Volunteer
•	Logistically supported a fundraising campaign focused on increasing the number and quality of suitable remote learning spaces in orphanages around the island as classes were moved online in response to the pandemic. 
•	Worked on a team focused on increasing the number of licensed children’s homes in operation locally by connecting lapsed homes to resources that would help reestablish their compliance and, thus, increase their standard and capacity of care. 

T&T Red Cross Society (TTRCS)		March 2020 – August 2020
Part-Time Organizational Volunteer
•	Worked with TTRCS to initiate their local Geographic Information Systems (GIS) capacity building efforts with the goal of collecting and integrating more qualitative and quantitative data into the regional organization’s decision making and project-planning procedures.
•	Our initial focusing was on mapping high-risk hazard areas (flooding exposed) and vulnerable populations (Venezuelan migrants).
