**Undergrad:** NYU, Biochemistry

**Graduate School:** QBS MS Health Data Science

**Medical School:** University of Minnesota

**Further Description:** I’m a recent graduate of the MS QBS program, and currently studying medicine at UM - my research interests are in deep learning/machine learning projects with clinical applicability. My master’s thesis was a patient outcome predictor using deep learning on electronic medical record data, but most recently I worked with Josh on creating an autoencoder-based feature extractor for whole slide images, as well as the metagenome framework Metacracker. I’m an avid rock climber.
