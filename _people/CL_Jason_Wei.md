**Undergrad:** Senior CS Student Dartmouth

**About Me:** My name is Jason Wei and I am graduating Dartmouth in June 2020 (and graduated from TJ in 2016). My research areas are in histopathology image analysis and natural language processing (NLP). I've trained neural networks to classify lung cancer, celiac disease, and colorectal polyps, as well as various image translation models. During college, I spent one fall studying abroad in Denmark and six months working at a startup in San Francisco.

**Update:** Currently, Jason Wei works at Google, performing NLP research.
