**School:** Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology

**About Me:**
Sagar Gupta is a rising senior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology interested in studying the computer science, specifically its applications at the intersection of bioinformatics and medicine. Last summer he gained valuable computational biology research experience in the fields of ML and protein structure, and this summer he is looking forward to branching out into different areas of pathology. Although much of his free time is consumed by Netflix, he also enjoys listening to music, learning Spanish, and annoying his twin brother.

**Project/Research Interests:**
- Proteopathies (i.e. proteins implicated in the pathology of diseases)
- Identification of biomarkers/pathways
- Gene expression/epigenetics
