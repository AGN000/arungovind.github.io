**About me:** Taylor has a B.S. in Biology from Green Mountain College. Post- undergraduate she has worked at the White River Junction VA Medical Center since 2018 as a Research Technician developing novel CRISPR/Cas systems for therapeutics against HIV and Hepatitis B. Taylor is currently a M.S. student in the Quantitative Biomedical Sciences Program. At Dartmouth she is interested in assessing CRISPR off-targets or unintentional gene editing to the human genome. Her goal is to help develop a novel computational technique to generate off-target libraries that can be used in a NGS workflow to accurately quantify off-targets in low-cost and efficient manner. In her free time, she enjoys woodworking , snowboarding, hiking and meeting as many cats as possible.
