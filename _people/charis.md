I am Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in QMUL's [Centre for Digital Music](https://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) (C4DM), [Turing Fellow](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/charalampos-saitis), and Deputy Director of the QMUL-BBC sponsored [CDT in Data-informed Audience-centric Media Engineering](https://dame.qmul.ac.uk/) (DAME).
My research centres on the creative combination of empirical and computational methods to understand different modalities of experience, interaction, and control between the digital music “user” (listeners, performers, producers) and sound as a multimodal semiotic system. 
My work has focused on semantic representations of timbre (also known as tone quality or sound colour) and more recently on [cross-sensory games](https://www.seeingmusic.app/). Scholarly contributions include co-editing [Timbre: Acoustics, Perception, & Cognition](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-14832-4) (Springer, 2019) and [Musical Haptics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-58316-7) (Springer, 2018). I am a founding member of the [International Conference on Timbre](https://timbre2020.mus.auth.gr/) and non-partner member of the [Analysis, Creation & Teaching of Orchestration](https://www.actorproject.org/) (ACTOR) project.

Previously, I was Humboldt Research Fellow at TU Berlin's [Audio Communication Group](https://www.ak.tu-berlin.de/menue/fachgebiet_audiokommunikation/), Research Associate at TU Dresden's [Chair of Acoustics & Haptics](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/elektrotechnik/ias/aha), and postdoc with the Data Science Lab of [Fondazione ISI](https://www.isi.it/en/home).
