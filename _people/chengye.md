I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London, funded by the China Scholarship Council. My current research is a deep Cross-Sensory (Auditory-Visual) Interactive Music Game. In this research, I will first collect data on the player's playback of the music they are watching, as well as the player's choices, and obtain raw sound and visual data. Several different neural networks are then used to train the mapping relationships between the different models. I expect the deep cross-modal models to explore the relationship between different sounds and visuals, and finally output matching images. My previous Masters final project was to compare the perception of the experience of different percussive instruments in VR.
