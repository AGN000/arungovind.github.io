I am interested in methods and concepts from machine learning and data science, including (but not limited to) Bayesian statistics and Bayesian modelling, distributed big data analytics as well as exceptional model mining.
Furthermore, I am particularly intrigued knowledge generation and integration into interplay of subjective information (e.g., human perceptions and feelings) and objective problem settings.
Also, I believe that the usage of background knowledge is an important aspect that I aim to explore especially in the context of small datasets as common in the medical field.
