I am passionate about highly collaborative projects and research that impact high-stake real-world problem settings at the intersection of medicine, environmental change, and human behavior through artificial intelligence and machine learning.

In this context I am interested in methods from multi-modal learning, network analysis, and exceptional model mining to Bayesian modeling, deep learning, representation learning, explainable AI, and human computer interaction.

In my free time, I love to dance üíÉ, read üìö, and whenever I get the chance I go surfing üèÑ
