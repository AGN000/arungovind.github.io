I am currently a PhD researcher in [Artificial Intelligence and Music](https://www.aim.qmul.ac.uk/) at the [Centre for Digital Music](https://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) at Queen Mary University of London. My research aims to investigate aspects of embodied cognition that can be computationally modelled to give insight into their utility for music information retrieval and human music cognition.
