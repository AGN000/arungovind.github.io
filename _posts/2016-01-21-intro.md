3, 2, 1, and action! Yes, it feels like that only after 3 months of various training activities my PhD camera finally started to roll. Thus, here and now I declare that the 'what am I going to do in my PhD?' phase is over, and as a proof I attach my (first ever) poster about it, which was prepared for the UKCA Theory and Practice Workshop, 4-8 January 2016.
