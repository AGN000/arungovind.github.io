Dear all:

I am planning to participate in the [2019 ASEEES](https://www.aseees.org/convention/2019-convention-theme#:~:text=The%202019%20ASEEES%20Annual%20Convention,Tuesday%2C%20November%2026%2C%202019.&text=Belief%20may%20be%20a%20universal,preoccupying%20concern%20across%20human%20cultures.) convention which will be held in San Francisco (Nov 23 - 26) and I am searching for people who would like to create a panel together. I am working on the history of creative writing programs in Russia, namely Briusov's Higher Institute of Literature and Art and Maxim Gorky Literary Institute, and I am looking for people interested in a related field. In broader terms it may be:
- Professionalization of writers
- Soviet Cultural Institutions in the 1920-1940s
- Sociology of Literature
- Russian Modernism
