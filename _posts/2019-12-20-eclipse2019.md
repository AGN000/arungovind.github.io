Coronal magnetic field dynamics lead to solar flares, solar storms, and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). These events affect the Earth's outer atmosphere and our technologies leading to power outages and disruption of communication and GPS networks. They can also damage satellites and more importantly harm our astronauts orbiting around the Earth jeopardizing their health through doses of high radiation and energetic particles. As we get more and more dependent on space-reliant technologies with every passing day, it becomes imperative for us to study these solar phenomena and develop the understanding to be able to predict these events with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, due to the scarcity of observations of the coronal magnetic field, scientists rely on computational models to constrain the magnetic nature of the corona. These scientific models, with an in-depth theoretical understanding of the dynamics of the solar corona can also provide a meaningful prediction of coronal magnetic field structures. Thus, observing the corona during an eclipse gives us an excellent opportunity to test the correctness of our models, and refine them leading to improved forecasting capabilities.

Novel utilization of two disparate computational models based on a theoretical framework postulated in Nandy et al. (2018) allows long-term prediction of the Sun's coronal magnetic field structure. The Predictive Solar Surface Flux Transport (PSSFT) model developed at CESSI (Bhowmik & Nandy 2018) is forward run for 43 days (since the last observed active region emergence) to first predict the surface magnetic field distribution on the Sun's surface expected on 26 December 2019. Subsequently a potential field source surface model utilizes the predicted solar surface field as its boundary condition to extrapolate the coronal fields expected on the day of the eclipse.

We compare the simulation results with the images acquired on the day of the eclipse of 26 December 2019, through a space  based coronagraph (SOHO/ LASCO C2) which observes upto 6 solar radius. The bright streamers (seen in LASCO C2) beyond the source surface (marked in white background) tend to orient along the closed magnetic loops. The observations show a very good match with the predicted tilt of the extended plumes which carry high-speed solar wind particles into interplanetary medium. Further analysis with observations from MLSO K-Cor data might tell us more about the near-sun coronal structure. 

Collective endeavours combining theoretical modeling with these coronal observations are expected to lead to refined data-driven operational forecasting models for solar activity induced space weather.
