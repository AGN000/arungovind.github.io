description: Running for the position of Trainee Representative
---
I was invited to participate in the ballot for the position of Trainee Representative on the Governing Committee of the <a href="https://www.ismrm.org/study-groups/quantitative-mr/" target="blank">ISMRM Quantitative MRI Study Group</a>.

If elected, I will begin to serve in April 2020 at the ISMRM 28th Annual Meeting held in Sydney, Australia. This is a 1-year Term.

The election will be open to all the members of the study group. It will begin in mid-January and will end on the 29th February.

### Proposed Programme
If I am elected the Trainee Representative of the Quantitative MRI Study Group, I will advocate for the trainee memebers (postgraduate students and postdoctoral fellows) of the study group and the broader ISMRM community, and work with the Study Group's Executive Committee to:
* advance educational content, for example, by organising virtual meetings
* organise trainee research awards at the 2020 annual meeting in Sidney, Australia
* highlight the needs and expertise of trainee members
* foster trainee interaction with the Study Group

### Past Experience
Having already served as the Trainee Representative for the ISMRM Electro-Magnetic Tissue Properties Study Group in 2018, I have acquired knowledge on the governance of ISMRM study groups and the ways study groups implement activities throughout the year, including activity organisation at the ISMRM annual meeting. This will allow me to better serve the Trainees of the Quantitative MRI Study Group and the broader ISMRM community.
