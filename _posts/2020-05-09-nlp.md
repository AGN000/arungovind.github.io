title:  Text Classifier with Multiple Outputs and Multiple Losses in Keras
date: 2020-05-09 21:01:00
description: Building a Multi-Label Classifier doesn't seem a difficult task using Keras, but when you are dealing with a highly imbalanced dataset with more than 30 different labels and with multiple losses it can become quite tricky.
---

In this post, we'll go through the definition of a multi-label classifier, multiple losses, text preprocessing and a step-by-step explanation on how to build a multi-output RNN-LSTM in Keras.

The dataset that we'll be working on consists of natural disaster messages that are classified into 36 different classes. The dataset was provided by Figure Eight. Example of input messages:

```
['Weather update - a cold front from Cuba that could pass over Haiti',
 'Is the Hurricane over or is it not over',
 'Looking for someone but no name',
 'UN reports Leogane 80-90 destroyed. Only Hospital St. Croix functioning. Needs supplies desperately.',
 'says: west side of Haiti, rest of the country today and tonight']
```

Images can be made zoomable.
Simply add `data-zoomable` to `<img>` tags that you want to make zoomable.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/8.jpg" data-zoomable>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/10.jpg" data-zoomable>
    </div>
</div>

The rest of the images in this post are all zoomable, arranged into different mini-galleries.
