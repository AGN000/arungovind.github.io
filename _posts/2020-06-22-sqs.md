Terraform is an amazing tool for building infrastructures. This tool is used for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform is the infrastructure as code offering from HashiCorp.

While using Terraform for building a project that Iâ€™m designing using Amazon Web Services (AWS), I came across the need to set up an API Gateway endpoint that takes records, put them into an SQS queue that triggers an Event Source for a Lambda function.

In this post, I would like to share with you each step required to build this infrastructure. This post assumes that you are familiar with Terraform code and AWS services.
