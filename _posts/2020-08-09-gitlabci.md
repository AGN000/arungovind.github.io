While working with terraform lambda modules, I had a hard time finding out the best repository architecture to automate my lambdas deployment. I couldn’t find any article that I could use as a guideline, that’s why I’m writing this article.

While working on big projects, project organization is a must-have. In this story, you will be presented to one way to organize your repositories so that it facilitates the deployment procedure, making it much more scalable.

In this article, we'll be building the following repositories architecture:

* **Lambda-Module**: Repository containing the Terraform Lambda module.
* **Lambda-Infra**: Repository containing Terraform code for deployment into AWS.
* **Lambda-Code**: Repository containing the lambda code for deployment using Gitlab-CI.
