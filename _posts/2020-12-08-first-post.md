This year has been marked by a lot of setbacks which has made it very difficult to do research. The ongoing pandemic has forced schools and universities to implement online classes despite the questionable readiness of the entire education system. 

In my attempt to be somewhat productive during this pandemic, I have decided to build this blog. I am currently preparing for my candidacy exam this coming Tuesday, December 15, 2020, so I will probably write about it on my next post.
