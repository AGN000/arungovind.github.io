The blog has no value if you are looking for my academic projects it is my experience abouts PC building. Can be useful to make good decisions about your consumer level PC upgrade choices as long as the blog's hardware stays relavant.
And also its from a noob so don't take it for granted always cross verify.
#### General suggestion always Check for this(in the order)
<ul>
    <li>Modularity and PSU rating</li>
    <li>PCI lane capacities</li>
    <li>Progamability</li>
    <li>Connectivity</li>
</ul>

### Poor Choices
For my first build, I was fixated on buying a *FULL AMD*, PC as they were much cheaper and after the release of stable drivers from `Vega` the gaming performance was on par with `Nvidia's GTX 1080 (non-ti)`. They only ball to hit now is a running `torch` which is commonly used GPU programing language for the PC. The PC parts arrived around the time of `Nov 2019` right after my `Master's` first semester ended.

I gave it a go, build the machine with the following components
- CM MWE 650W fully modular Gold (SMPS)
- Asus RoG x570 Gaming-E  (Mobo)
- Ryzen 3600              (CPU)
- Asus RoG AMD Vega 64    (GPU)
- A Spectrix G60G Ram with 3600Mhz with CL16 CAS Latency (RAM 8GBx2)
- Nzxt H510 Case with a USB 3.2 type C at front (Case)


The Mobo comes with a dual ethernet connection of Intel 1GBit and Realtek 2.5Gbit. With Mosfets and VRMs similar in the league of `Asus X470 Crosshair` which is the best board every made in the previous generation. Additionally, it was on par in maintaining lower temperatures and handling `PCIE-4.0` speeds toe-to-toe with the `x570-Asus Crosshair`. One more great thing about this board is, it does not have a single, old gen `USB2.0`, all ports are `USB 3+`. When coupled with `CL16` CAS of RAM it is supposed perform the best.
Though it did perform pretty well, its not worth the price. As I coupled a `INR 15K CPU` with a `INR 27k Mobo`, I could not experience full potential of the MOBO. The general rule of thumb is, always get a CPU which is `> or ==` the price of the mobo. 

My motivation to choose a `x570` over a `b450` or `x470` was to upgrade storage to `PCIE-4.0` harnessing more speeds than regular `PCIE-3.0`.
I think it was a steep jump of `1300 MBps to 4000 MBps` when moving from `3.0` to `4.0`.

```Finally it looked something like this.!```

## What's the problem then?
The first and simple problem I fixed was the issue with `ASUS RoG Vega 64` thermal pads which raise the `temperature` of one of the VRM.

I fixed it with this [GELID TP-GP02 12W/k](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32909559765.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.135.150c1802gP7TcZ) thermal pad which provides similar performanace as expensive `Thermal Grizzly pads`.

I followed this video to fix the VRM temps.

After all this investment of time I found that `RoCM` required to run `torch` does not work.
Well the  `RoCM` states the AMD Vega card support `torch`. Well thats not TRUE! I probably might have tried every combination and permutation to make it run but it always fails. Once I was able to get it running but have noticed that `NON GPU` variant was running faster than the `GPU` one.

I decided to DITCH the `Vega` and wanted to opt for a `Nvidia GTX`
