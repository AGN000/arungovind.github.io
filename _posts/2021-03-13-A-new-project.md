Lately, I found about <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and became very excited to make my personal website. I found <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> which is somehow very connected to GitHub Pages and provide some themes that can help you with a blog and so on. I then found <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">al-folio</a> theme which is made by Alshedivat which is also and amazing theme as it is intended for academics and provide a page for blogs and is very neat and easy to use.

I cloned the theme right away and started customizing by disabling the unneeded but great features and there we go, as simple as that. The posts in the blog come with a lot of features and additions that are really great, the post can have comments, code snippets with highlights according to the language used, images that can be organized in the way you want, maths equations, formats and links, and much more. The theme can be used as a portfolio or as a cv to access your public information by employers, events organizers and so on. Dark mode is also included in the theme. You can also change the colours in the theme using provided variables with suitable colours. The writing of posts and addition in projects section are easy and are made using a simple markdown with Liquid code. 

I intend to use this website as a 'portfolio' and blog. More additions are coming soon.
