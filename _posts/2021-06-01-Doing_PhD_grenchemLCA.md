Switching jobs can be a daunting task, especially if you've spent years in the same industry. However, sometimes the risk is worth taking if it leads to a fulfilling and rewarding career. This is exactly what happened to me when I left my previous job as a Plant Engineer in the private industry to pursue a PhD in Life Cycle Assessment for green chemistry processes.

Making the switch wasn't easy, but it was definitely worth it. As a Plant Engineer for the <a href="https://es.dow.com/es-es/public-report/tarragona-turnaround.html">Dow Chemical TurnAround in Tarragona 2021</a>, I was responsible for ensuring that all the planned tasks were efficient and cost-effective. While the work was challenging, I found myself wanting to do more to help the environment. This desire led me to explore the field of green chemistry, which focuses on developing chemical products and processes that are environmentally sustainable.

When I started my PhD in Life Cycle Assessment for green chemistry processes, I knew that I had made the right decision. My PhD is a collaborative project between <a href="https://www.esci.upf.edu/en/unesco-chair-in-life-cycle-and-climate-change/catedra-introduction">UNESCO Chair in Life Cycle and Climate Change ESCI-UPF</a> and the Swiss company, <a href="https://deasyl.com/">Deasyl SA</a>. The work is fascinating, and I'm learning new things every day. I'm working on projects that have real-world applications, and I know that the work I'm doing will have a positive impact on the environment.

While salary or resources might not be as abundant as in a multinational private company, one of the things that I love about my new job is the collaborative environment. I'm working with a team of people who are passionate about green chemistry and sustainability and who are all working towards the same goal. We share ideas and work together to find solutions to complex problems. Here, we not only know what and how we do things... but we also know why we do those things.

Another thing that I appreciate about my new job is the flexibility. As a Plant Engineer, I was always on call and had tighter schedule. Now, although the workload is still high, I have more control over my working hours, which allows me to spend more time with my family and pursue other interests outside of work.

Overall, I'm so happy that I made the switch to a career in green chemistry research. I feel like I'm making a difference and contributing to a better future for all of us. If you're considering a career change, my advice is to follow your passion and take the leap. It may be scary at first, but it could lead to a more fulfilling and rewarding career in the long run.
