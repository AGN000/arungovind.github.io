The total number of medals was increasing with each subsequent year. 
Next I want to find top
countries by the number of gold medals from all the years.

It is interesting that there was a tough competition between `USA` and `USSR` in the years of cold war. In the year when one of that countries boycotted Olympics (1980 and 1984), the balance of power has been shifted to another one.

Nowadays, `Russia` cannot impose a fight like this for the `USA`, but it seems that `China` can.
