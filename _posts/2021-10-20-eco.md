## Abstract:
The study is focused on the effects of technological progress on economic growth in advanced countries over the past 130 years; Data was gathered for advanced countries over the given period, these countries have been chosen for their economic relevance. 1) G7 nations 2) A collective of European nations grouped as Euro in 2010, with 93.2% of the Euro Area GDP. The related variables simulated were GDP per capita, capital intensity, and labour productivity using the well known Cobb-Douglas Production function; After being transformed into valid econometric models, the established theoretical models were empirically checked; This study found out that increase in technology resulted in an economic growth. Furthermore, the effects of capital input and labour input are also briefly examined. 
**Keywords:** Economic growth; Technology; Productivity; advanced countries

## 1. Introduction 
The thesis is useful on a quantitative basis because it sought to model the real level of technology by separating other factors from the "remaining value”. (Bekar et al. 2018). Totalfactor productivity is the term most widely used by economists (TFP), which is also generally known as “remaining value” or “residual value”(Kenton 2000). The difference betweenthe proportional change in output and the proportional change in a Divisa index of inputs is known as total factor productivity. Solow's "remaining value," according to Liu Sifeng (Yuan et al. 2009), reflects the contribution of all variables in the Cobb-Douglas production function except fund and labour to output ratio. Hence, the study looks at technology factor separately from the “remaining value” and estimates its effects on economic growth. Furthermore, the report contends on a brief examination, that increases in either labour or capital productivity led to a fall in economic development(Alani 2012). According to the report, this is attributed to an increase in leisure use after an increase in either capital or labour productivity, since people prefer to trade off leisure for jobs as their incomes grow.

## 2. Research Objectives
I. Analysis of the impact of the level of technology on economic development in advanced countries during the aforementioned period. 
II. To test the separation of the amount of technological advancement from the "remaining value" or TFP. 
III. Checking whether the technology progress has the same effect across the 2 groups of aforementioned countries.
IV. Brief examination of capital and labour inputs. 39

## 3. Literature Review
The literature review focuses on estimating the impact of technological advancement on economic development. Following the study, a new paradigm connecting technical innovation and labour and capital productivity is created. conomists like (Carlaw and Lipsey 2003) suggest that the total factor productivity is often interpreted as the technological progress and which in turn promotes economic growth. However, there seems to be a major error in measuring the technology factor from the TFP as a whole. (Hulten 2001) identified that the various factors contributing to the TFP are not measured individually but grouped together as a residual or “remaining value”. In particular, there is an increasing body of literature demonstrating that productivity growth is not an indicator of technical progress (Gordon 2000). As a result, TFP is a deceptive definition of productivity because: (a) a critical analysis of the Cobb-Douglas production function reveals that typical TFP exceeds real TFP by an amount equal to the growth in output. (b) the majority of economists who write about total factor productivity, It's possible that they didn't bother differentiating it from the level of technology or the technology factor (Alani 2012). Furthermore, most economists, like (Casetti and Jones 1983) and (Hornstein and Krusell 1996), believe that increased productivity leads to ncreased economic growth. Theoretical models derived from the Cobb-Douglas output function, such as the one described in this study, seem to extend support to this belief. 

**3.1. Model Background**
The Cobb-Douglas production function, as advanced by Knut Wicksell (Edward Elgar 2021) and statistically evaluated to provide proof by Paul Douglas and Charles Cobb in 1928 (Cobb and Douglas 1928), is the most commonly used in economics to describe the relationship between output and inputs.

$$ 
𝑌 = 𝐴𝐾^𝛼𝐿^𝛽 
$$

𝑊ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑌 = 𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡, 𝐴 = 𝑡𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑛𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑦 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑡 ,𝐾 = 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡, 𝐿 = 𝐿𝑎𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑟 𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 

In the above equation the α and β are constants that are determined by technology. Whereas, in macroeconomic modelling, the Cobb-Douglas output function is given by,

$$
𝑄 = 𝐾^𝛼𝐿^(1−𝛼)
$$

𝑊ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑄 = 𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡,𝐾 = 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙 , 𝐿 = 𝐿𝑎𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑟 73

This equation is first order homogenous as the returns to scale is constant (Cobb and Douglas 1928). A constant returns to scale tells us that the output will increase proportional to the increase in all the input variables by the ame factor (Peston 1960). However, in this study we modify the above equation to model the technology factor and estimate its effects. Now, the equation becomes

$$
𝑌 = 𝐴^𝜆𝐾^𝛼𝐿^𝛽
$$

Here, the returns -to-scale is given by `$$ 𝛾 = 𝜆 + 𝛼 + 𝛽 $$`

We shall use this returns to scale metric in further sections to validate our hypothesis in this study. We see, if we are getting a constant returns to scale, and increase in returns to scale or a decrease in returns to scale. In hindsight, we are looking at a macro economics of scale for advanced nations (Investopedia 2014). 

**3.2. Model of technological progress**
Tinbergen's improved Cobb-Douglas output function (TINBERGEN 1964) is often used to measure the contribution of technical innovation to economic development. Solow's "remaining benefit," according to Liu Sifeng, reflects the ontribution of all variables but capital and labour to the production ratio (Yuan et al. 2009). However, Liu Sifeng claims that the approach has some significant flaws that make it impossible to make accurate predictions in a realistic analysis. This is because a variety of random factors influence production growth, contributing to an overestimation of technological growth factor. (Liu et al. 2009) went on to distinguish the influences of other causes from the “remaining value” in order to achieve a more accurate estimate of technological progress. However, their method does not consider the direct effect of technological progress. It only estimates the time variation of technological progress (Alani 2012). Hence, the modified equation mentioned above will be a good consideration for our study. 

**3.3. Initial assumptions**
The current thesis advances the idea that technological growth varies exponentially with respect to productivity. Solow's "remaining value" is used to calculate the pace of technological change that is given by,

$$
ΔA/A=ΔY/Y− 𝛼 (ΔK/K)− 𝛽 (ΔL/L)
$$

A least squares estimation might be used to remove the effect of non-technological parameters’ progress and other factors such as random inflation. It is very evident that it is difficult to obtain the other factors through the “remaining value” function (Alani 2012). However, we evaluate the calculated ‘A’ with the TFP values for the respective countries and examine the relation between them. This tells us if the TFP or the “remaining value” is actually the technological parameter. In the demand side, manufacturers would tend to lower their labour demand and they would like to create the same amount of production with less labour because labour productivity has improved in order to gain more income (Lindenberger 2003). Workers enjoy more leisure when their wages hit the ideal amount for a comfortable standard of living, while higher wage prices provide a disincentive for working longer hours (Koutsoyiannis 1979). As a result, employers would consider it fair to work fewer hours to achieve the same amount of production if their productivity had improved (Alani 2012). Also, production decreases as efficiency increases, resulting in an inverse relationship between productivity and output.

$$
ΔY/ΔK= (−𝛼/(1 − 𝛼−𝛽))(𝑌^(1+ 𝛼+𝛽)/𝐾)
$$
Capital Productivity

$$
ΔY/ΔL= (−𝛼/(1 − 𝛼−𝛽))(𝑌^(1+ 𝛼+𝛽)/𝐿)
$$
Labour Productivity

We have theoretical assumptions and empirical studies suggesting a decrease in returns to scale based on labour and capital productivity i.e., `$$ 0 < 𝛼 +𝛽 < 1 $$`

Theories of Capital and labour productivity derive an output function with respect to increase in respective productivities. Substituting the labour and capital productivity in place of capital and labour growth in Cobb-Douglass function will enable us to evaluate the effects on economic growth (Alani 2012).After relevant substitutions, data was gathered directly for capital and labour productivities, the per capita gross domestic products, and the total factor productivity for Euro region and the G7 nations (Bergeaud et al. 2019). 

**3.4 The data**

| Pages     | Series Name | Units     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| LP      | Labour productivity  | $US 2010 ppp per hours   |
| TFP   | Total Factor Productivity  | $US 2010 ppp based      |
| KI    | Capital Intensity  | $US 2010 ppp per hours  |
| GDP pc   | Gross Domestic Product per capita | $US 2010 ppp per persons  |


Our key dataset is the one used by (Bergeaud et al. 2019), and it is based on the work of (Cette et al. 016) and (Bergeaud et al. 2018), which collected data for 17 OECD countries from 1890 to 2019. These countries were selected based on their economic importance: the G7 (the United States, Japan, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Canada), five other eurozone countries (Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, and Finland), and five other countries that account for a large share of global GDP at any point during our time span or have a particular interest in terms of productivity (Australia, Switzer- land, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway). In comparison, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, and Finland have reformed the Eurozone. This approximation seems to be acceptable given that these eight countries accounted for 93.2 percent of Eurozone GDP in 2010. The year 1890 was selected as the starting point in order to provide a sufficiently long time series to initialize our capital stock (Alani 2012). However, for our study we chose, 2 group of countries: The G7 nations and the nations grouped as Euro area. The reason was to develop a comparison of technological growth and investment with respect to economic growth over 130 years (De la Escosura 2015). We used series constructed by economists and historians on clear assumptions for long aggregate historical results. Many of these data are subject to confusion and inaccuracy, not just for distant but also for recent times. The data was compiled at the country level under the assumption of constant boundaries, in their most recent condition (Alani 2012). One critical factor in answering these questions is quantifying the impact of conventional growth factors (capital, labour) when accounting for their efficiency, but beyond this growth accounting exercise, delving deeper into the role of General-Purpose Technologies (GPT) in long-term growth. Development accounting (Kenton 2000) was the first effort to explore the relative functions of output factors, but it failed to explain the majority of twentieth-century growth, which was due to total factor productivity (TFP), the residual of this decomposition. This notion of TFP being related to technology is largely because it is hard to capture the effects of other residual factors affecting economic growth. In our next section let us look at the framework used in this study, and the process and methodology used to develop it. However, we have already established a firm base in section 3.3 assuming the replacements of capital growth and labour growth by capital intensity and labour productivity as a basis of our model. At this point, the a priori assumptions shall be an increase in returns to scale with respect to technological progress, and a decrease in returns to scale with respect to labour and capital productivity.
