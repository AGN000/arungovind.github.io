What is Moloch?

Slate Star Codex (SSC) believes Moloch to be the failure to coordinate.  Or
really, Moloch is the tendency to compete (and win) over all other values.
Or really, Moloch is the determination to play finite games instead of
infinite games.

The crypto world seems to have agree with SSC's interpretation of Moloch.
We have the Moloch DAO to form DAO centered around funding coordination.
We have Gitcoin who repeatedly remarks public goods failures as coordination
failures.  We have the Commons Stack building token economies for the
commons to fight coordination failures.  We have Coordinate
doing....something.  In Crypto, all problems boil down to coordination
failures.

But what if Moloch is much simpler?  SSC's consistent framing for Moloch is
that of an old god demanding all values be sacrificed for the sake of
survival amongst Nature.  This has two, potentially false, assumptions:
  1.  Nature is actively trying to kill us.
  1.  Trying to survive is not a value.

My take differs quite radically.

Moloch is the tendency of sentient beings to choose the value of survival
over other values.  That's it.  In more words, Moloch is the failure to
balance competing values.  Nature is not trying to kill us, instead, change
is inevitable and all things naturally arise and die over time and
ultimately values must always be balanced.  No value is always best in all
situations.  And nothing in guaranteed to survive.  In fact, from a Buddhist
view all things are guaranteed to end.

SSC does equate Moloch to Lovecraftian Old Gods.  This relation feels much
more right given that the base desire for living beings to survive is
ancient and continues deep within pretty much all living things.  If Moloch
is the personification of blind pursuit of survival, he is for sure the
oldest of Old Gods.  But he is not the god behind all Old Gods, nor is he
the only Old God.  Instead, anytime we fixate on any single value above all
other values we make a new Old God like Moloch.  And that new Old God of our
own creation too will one day engulf us.

If coordination becomes a value above all values, that too will become an
Old God alongside Moloch.  The God of Optimizing Coordination will seek to
delude us in optimizing coordination.  It will bring us down to the realm of
fighting over winning finite games.

Only the infinite game can overcome Old Gods.
