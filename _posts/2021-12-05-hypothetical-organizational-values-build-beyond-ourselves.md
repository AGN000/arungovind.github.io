Why did Buddhism survive for so long? And then grow to have so many very
distinct sects? To me, the answer hides in the key message of the Buddha
(Siddhartha Gautama) and how he spread the practice. First and foremost, the
Dharma, what Buddhists aspire to fully understand, is all around us.  It
can be found in a pile of leaves, in a lotus flower, or in a salad.  The
dharma is for all sentient beings.  Not just Brahmins of ancient India, not
people in India, not just human beings on earth, not even just beings with
corporeal form.  The Dharma is for all sentient beings from the lowest realm
to the highest realm.  Its beyond any one of us and beyond any one time
period.

Second, how we understand the Dharma must live beyond anyone person.  The
Buddha was never the gatekeeper to the Dharma.  Never the sole person to
truly understand the Dharma.  Nor did the Buddha name a successor.
Instead, the Buddha was one who began the Dharma wheel, the one to informed
others that the Dharma exists all around us and that each of us must
discover the lessons on our own.  And ultimately, the practice or
understanding was mandated or funneled through any individual, the practice
lives through an entire group of practitioners , the sangha.  Each of us must
learn lessons and wisdom from the Dharma and even if the Buddha never
existed in history, the Dharma would still exist and it is co-existent with
our lived experiences.

From that, I see a lesson for any organization meant to last 2500 years and
which aims to benefit others beyond the organization (ideally everyone or
thing on earth).

Every action must be done for more than ourselves.  And those actions must be done with a means that will continue far beyond ourselves.

This is what Build Beyond Ourselves tries to convey.  Even thought it may
seem impossible, any great product or service must exist for the causes and
conditions of people we may never meet and may never know.  They may be
forever distant from us linguistically, physically, or even temporally.  But
what is made now may one day impact that unknown person (or non-human
sentient being). and with skillful means applied now, that impact can be a
positive impact.

But further, how we build must never be centered around any one of us.  It
cannot be guided purely by our desires or goals or missions.  It can never
be limited our lifetimes or time availabilities.  If our skilful
organizational means or our vision falters when one person leaves then we
have only built a practice and a set of habits that center around ourselves.
Like a sangha, we must steward our knowledge and habits for when we
eventually depart so that others may continue the practice.

As we learn to build beyond ourselves, we steward a true commons far into
the future.
