Plastics are an essential material with many applications at the macro- and micro-economic level. They help to solve a multitude of problems that society has had to face throughout history. They are used as lightweight and innovative materials in the automotive industry, where they help to save fuel and reduce CO2 emissions. They have a high performance when used as insulators, so they contribute to achieve considerable energy savings. They are widely used as packaging, where they ensure food safety and reduce food waste. In recent years, they have even been combined with 3D printing technology for the manufacture of biocompatible medical parts that can save human lives.

However, there are some well-known drawbacks associated with the management of this material. The problems caused by plastic waste and the current situation of the sector make it necessary to rethink processes and business models to ensure the sustainability of the sector. The need to develop a circular economy in the plastics industry and the actions this entails have already been identified in the literature, together with analyses of how these needs might be met through the use of technologies and enablers of Industry 4.0.

This recently published <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-90033-5_14">article</a> aims the preliminary design of a plastic waste management network that integrates the technologies and concepts of Industry 4.0 and the principles of the circular economy. For this purpose, the Industrial Internet Reference Architecture (IIRA) methodology has been used to cover all stages of the life cycle of plastic products. A model combining the use of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to optimize plastic waste management is presented as a sustainable technological and economical alternative with the potential to improve environmental, social and corporate governance for greater sustainability of the plastics industry.

The holistic methodology adopted enables the development of a versatile, adaptable and scalable architecture that will be of interest to public and private actors in the plastics value chain.

The article is a result of my final project for the master's degree in Industry 4.0 at the International University of La Rioja and it has been developed together with the <a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=6OzCWSIAAAAJ&hl=es">Dr. Daniel María González Pérez</a> & <a href="https://www.unir.net/profesores/javier-rainer/">Dr. J. Javier Rainer</a>.
