## Introduction
My research interests lie in the intersection of computer science (artificial intelligence and machine learning), robotics, psychology and neuroscience. Neuroscience helps us to understand the neurons in the brain and the biological basis of psychology and AI. Psychology gives interpretation of our mind and behavior which enable us to design algorithms toward natural intelligence. Computer science correlates above with mathematics and other sciences to build a machine simulates brain. Finally, robotics assembles everything with mechanical and electrical engineering into an intelligent human-like robot with dexterous body. This also applies to animal-like robots. I am particularly passionate about exploring how the brain works and how we understand the world. My goal is to build robots with high-level intelligence to have similar thinking processes like humans and other animals, including perception, learning, decision-making and other cognitive modeling.

Artificial intelligence progressed rapidly over years. Following the trend of new models or even new paradigm in machine learning, we can see that some of them incorporate psychological concepts. For example, reinforcement learning. Sutton & Barto's book<d-cite key="sutton2018reinforcement"></d-cite> introduces RL by letting us to think about the nature of learning which is the interaction between environment and ourselves. Although maybe it's not explicit, our brain is generating actions based on environment to maximize reward both in the short term and long term. Therefore, psychology/cognitive science and neuroscience are crucial to build AI algorithms toward natural intelligence.
