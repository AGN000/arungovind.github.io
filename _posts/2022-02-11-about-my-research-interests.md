## Motivation
"What I cannot create, I do not understand" - Richard Feynman

The first time I saw this quote, is on Professor Samuel Gershmanâ€™s Computational Cognitive Neuroscience: Building Models of the Brain. Then I also heard it from an interview with Geoffrey Hinton. It reminds me that in my junior year of college, I was keen on building something from scratch like operating system and blockchain. And in my senior year, I started to have interests in brain and intelligence. I deeply know that the only way to fully understand our brain is to build one. In the mean time, I have been told that some of the brain functionalities, such as consciousness, may never be computable. However, I will hold on to hope that one day we can model the brain and understand psychology in a computational manner.
