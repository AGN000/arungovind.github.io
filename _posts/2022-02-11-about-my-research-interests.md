## Motivation
When I was taking courses like Artificial Intelligence and Introduction to Computer Vision at UMass (Spring 2020), I've seen some exhaustive-search based algorithms and some early pattern recognition algorithms which I don't consider these algorithms to be intelligent. The first time I feel artificial intelligence (AI) is somewhat intelligent is the time I get to know neural networks. 

However, my interests in AI and cognitive science (COGSCI) began with a research internship at Fudan University in Summer 2021 which the topic is mainly about robotic grasping and computer vision. This is one of the most meaningful experience I had in my life because it let me rethink AI. The way most robots grasp an object nowadays is to first localize the object. The object ready for pick-up is represented by a 3D coordinate relative to the robot base frame. Then the motion planning program operates the robotic arm to grasp the object while satisfying movement constraints. Although, technically, there are other components like dynamic control, image classification, grasp pose estimation, it is beyond the scope of this article. These processes got me thinking about the differences on grasping between a human or any other animal and a robot. Apparently, the human brain will not compute an exact 3D location of an object before grasping it. I started to realize the big gap between artificial intelligence and real intelligence.

While I am studying Machine Learning, Probabilistic Graphical Models or any other AI-related courses at UMass or by myself, I will also think about how human cognize this world and interact with the world including perception, learning, decision-making and other cognitive functionalities in our brain. After reading some very influential papers and getting to know pioneers of AI including Geoffrey Hinton who won the Turing Award in 2018, I found out that many of them either holds an degree in psychology or did research on COGSCI, I confirmed the importance of COGSCI to AI.

My goal is to make AI approaches real intelligence and apply them to robots.
