My research interests lie in the intersection of computer science, robotics, psychology and neuroscience. I think neuroscience gives an overview of structure and the connectivity of the brain. Psychology gives interpretation of our mind and behaviour which generates actions. Computer science correlates above with mathematics and other sciences to build a machine which simulates brain. Finally, robotics assembles everything with mechanical and electrical engineering into an intelligent human-like machine with dexterous body. This also applies to animal-like robots.
