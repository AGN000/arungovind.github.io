Last Friday it was time to publicly present the project on which we have been working intensively for the last few months. CuidaPro has arrived to revolutionize the elderly sector and respond to their needs and those of their families.

To thank Leonor Bertomeu from Delta.cat for her great work as presenter and facilitator of the event.

On behalf of the entire team, we would like to express our sincere gratitude to Mr. Enric Adell Moragrega, vice-president of the Provincial Council of Tarragona and Mr. Felip Monclús, director of the Territorial Services of Social Rights Terres de l'Ebre for his assistance, participation and words. It was a pleasure to have you.

We would also like to thank the political representatives of the Council of Els Muntells, Sant Jaume d'Enveja, Amposta, Poble Nou del Delta and Tortosa for their assistance.

Thanks to the Vice Dean of Lands of the Ebre of the Official College of Social Work of Catalonia.

Thanks to the musicians Laia and Marc from the Tortosa Music Conservatory for their excellent performance and to Conficon Hostesses for their professionalism.

Of course, to the Chamber of Commerce of Tortosa for its great involvement attention.

And last, but not least, thank you for the presence and support of the group of care workers who are part of the labor exchange and who were by our side. You are CuidaPro's reason for being.
