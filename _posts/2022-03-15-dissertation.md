title:  Network Control of Cell Identity and Plasticity in Small Cell Lung Cancer
date:   2022-03-15
description: One of my goals with my dissertation presentation was to make it accessible to a wide audience, including fellow grad students, professors, and family and friends. I use animation to accomplish this, starting from the basics of cell identity and ending with the impact my research on small cell lung cancer could have on treatment decisions.
