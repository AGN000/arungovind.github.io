Hi there! Welcome to my blog!

I finally had the energy (and time) to launch my website, and with it, I'm launching a blog! So, what will it be about? Mostly technical stuff I'm interested in and maybe some career thoughts/advice, but other topics may show up, who knows? 

As I enumerated some of my interests on the [homepage]({{ site.url }}) you may know what to expect. In the near future content about [Convex Optimization](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/) will probably appear as I'm studying the subject with some friends (I may try some applications in the financial market as I still have the illusion that one day I'll be rich using math :disappointed:).

That's it! I hope to see you soon. If this post wasn't much useful for you I present you a pretty useful software:
