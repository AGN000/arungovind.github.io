I am very happy after participating in my first scientific congress. I had the opportunity of sharing the first results of my PhD thesis, hosted by the <a href="https://www.esci.upf.edu/en/unesco-chair-in-life-cycle-and-climate-change/catedra-introduction">UNESCO Chair in Life Cycle and Climate Change ESCI-UPF</a> and in collaboration with the Swiss start-up <a href="https://deasyl.com/">Deasyl Innovation Green Chemistry</a>.

The <a href="https://europe2022.setac.org/">Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) Europe 32nd annual meeting</a> has been a wonderful experience that has allowed me to learn a lot and reaffirm my conviction that science must be reachable and understandable by everybody.

Looking forward to continuing to grow through this kind of activity.
