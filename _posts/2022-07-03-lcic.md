It has been a great pleasure having the opportunity to present some of the first results of my thesis in Green Chemistry production LCAs (with the <a href="https://www.esci.upf.edu/en/unesco-chair-in-life-cycle-and-climate-change/catedra-introduction">UNESCO Chair in Life Cycle and Climate Change ESCI-UPF</a> and <a href="https://deasyl.com/">Deasyl Innovation Green Chemistry</a>) here in the <a href="https://fslci.org/lcic/lcic2022/">3rd Life Cycle Innovation Conference (LCIC)</a> by the Forum for Sustainability through Life Cycle Innovation e.V. - FSLCI.

The topic presented consiste in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.161094">Life cycle assessment on calcium zincate production methods for rechargeable batteries</a>.

I had the opportunity to assist to interesting sessions on bridging sustainability and digitalization, standardizing methodologies for LCA and managing data, among others.

And last but not least, I am very happy of having met new colleagues on this field.
