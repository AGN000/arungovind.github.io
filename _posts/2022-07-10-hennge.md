Python is an amazing language. It enables me to quickly prototype a solution to any kind of scripting tasks.
However, as my code grows in size and complexity, I find myself refactoring stuff around, creating extra tests that I should have created a week ago, and creating config files for seemingly simple stuff. 
I do not have the vision for the perfect organization of my project; I guess most people don't and that's okay.  

Only way to efficiently organize code is by making mistakes and being willing to change mindset.
These are some of the useful tricks I learned over the past couple of weeks. This writing is merely a reminder for my future self. If you find it useful, I am glad!
