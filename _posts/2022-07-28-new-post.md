Hi, I'm adding this new post to test if my RSS (Really Simple Syndication) reader updates.

Currently investigating how Jerome Powell hikes interest rates, changing the "target range for the federal funds rate". Most `.gov` websites have RSS subscription, so I installed a RSS reader on my Mac.

RSS receives blogs to a single inbox. It was popular during the 2000s, in the so called "web 1.0" era, when people post blogs on their own domain. But now we are in "web 2.0", where people post instead on `twitter.com` or WeChat Moments. They manage feed on their own platform, so we don't look for RSS anymore.
