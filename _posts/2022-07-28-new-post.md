Hi, I'm adding this new post to test if my RSS (Really Simple Syndication) reader updates.

Currently investigating how Jerome Powell hikes interest rates, changing the "target range for the federal funds rate". Most `.gov` websites have RSS subscription, so I installed one on my Mac. I recall my website also have RSS functions, so I thought I could test it out.

I see RSS as a service to receive updates of internet articles at a single box. I guess RSS could be popular during the 2000s, during the so called "web 1.0" era, when people post their blogs on their own domain. However, nowadays we are in "web 2.0", where people post instead on places like `twitter.com`, or WeChat Moments. These apps could manage our feed on its own platform, so we don't look for RSS anymore.
