## About
1. My favorite quote is: "What I cannot create, I do not understand" - Richard Feynman
   
2. For me, the fundamental problem in artificial intelligence is not higher performance metrics or faster computation, but how to make machines more like humans. 
   
3. My research interests in AI and cognitive science are greatly influenced by Professor Geoffrey Hinton and Professor Josh Tenenbaum.
