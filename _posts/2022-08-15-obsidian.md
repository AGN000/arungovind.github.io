Obsidian is a note system that works on local Markdown files. Here in this screenshot we can tell, there is a file pane on the left where all notes and folders are there. On the right, Obsidian provides notes in graph view, because:

> The human brain is non-linear: we jump from idea to idea, all the time. Your second brain should work the same. In Obsidian, making and following **connections** is frictionless. Tend to your notes like a gardener; at the end of the day, sit back and marvel at your own knowledge graph.

That is amazing. Imagine that we read an article, have some notes, and drop it into word. How could we find it again? The note should be a puzzle card of a well-structured knowledge system.

## Obsidian - before the start

By using PARA, there is no more confusion about where to put my files or folders.

### The PARA File systems: How to organize notes and folders

This [blog](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/)) has an introduction in detail about PARA method:

> P.A.R.A. stands for **Projects — Areas — Resources — Archives**, the four top-level categories that encompass every type of information you might encounter in your work and life.
> 
>  **Project** 
> - **A project has a *goal* and deadline**.
> - Examples: Complete app mockup; Develop project plan; Execute business development campaign; Write blog post; Finalize product specifications; Attend conference
> 
> **Area**
> -  **A area has a standard to be maintained**, which bad or good you are responsible for. You will continuously work on that to improve your ***performance***.
> - Examples: Health; Finances, Professional Development; Travel; Hobbies; Friends; Apartment; Car; Productivity; Direct reports; Product Development; Writing
> 
> **Resource** 
> - examples: habit formation; project management; transhumanism; coffee; music; gardening; online marketing; SEO; interior design; architecture; note-taking
> 
> **Archives** 
> - examples: projects that have been completed or become inactive; areas that you are no longer committed to maintaining; resources that you are no longer interested in.

### GTD: Getting things done by checklist

After turning your goals into projects, we need to accomplished it by spending our time. How to arrange our daily life, to balance the study, life, work and family? Here I introduced the book *Getting Things Done*.

I highly recommend this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODhHTngIMJE) to learn the basic ideas of GTD.

The natural steps of emerging of ideas is capturing, processing and doing. Thus, GTD suggests:
- Establish an *inbox* to capture all ideas, and free up your brain. The more empty of your mind, the more smooth of your mind, called [flow state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)).
- *Clarify and organize* your ideas. First, to make sure the next step of your plan is **actionable**. Second, to make your ideas in proper category:
	- The Eisenhower Matrix.
	- *Next action, waiting for, Someday maybe.

In obsidian, we have [checklist plugin](https://github.com/delashum/obsidian-checklist-plugin).

### Kanban: How to do project management

Kanban is the way to visualize your workflows. For any projects, you have several long-term goals, or short-term goals. In order to achieve it, we have something to do.
