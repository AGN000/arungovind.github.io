LCA is an essential tool for measuring the environmental impact of a product throughout its life cycle. During my PhD with the <a href="https://www.esci.upf.edu/en/unesco-chair-in-life-cycle-and-climate-change/catedra-introduction">UNESCO Chair in Life Cycle and Climate Change ESCI-UPF</a> and <a href="https://deasyl.com/">Deasyl Innovation Green Chemistry</a>, I focus on implementing LCA for different processes and chemical products.

The first paper (together with Dr. Alba Bala and Dr. Pere Fullana i Palmer) of my thesis, a review of 47 LCA of chemical reactions, was recently published in the <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/gc/d2gc02089k/unauth">RSC Green Chemistry</a>. It is a pleasure to share it and continue working and researching in this field.
