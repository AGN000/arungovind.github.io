Last Tuesday we were present at the event of the 8th delivery of the SuperCuidadores Awards organized by SUPERCUIDADORES with the support of UNIR - La Universidad en Internet. Counting on the honorary presidency of the Kings of Spain and the presence of the president of the Community of Madrid, Mrs. Isabel DÃ­az Ayuso. We spent a unique day accompanied by representatives of the socio-health sector and care for the dependent. The event took place at the emblematic Real Casa de Correos in Madrid's Puerta del Sol.

The main objective was to give visibility to the group of carers and the great work they carry out on a daily basis.

A day of learning and new knowledge that we take with us. We are left with one sentence: "Take care as you would like to be taken care of". We will continue to select, accompany, train and support all the professionals in our team so that this is the reason for BEING and the reason for DOING ðŸ§¡.
