This week I had the pleasure of attending <a href="https://2022.conama.org/">CONAMA 2022</a>, which coincided with the end of COP27.

It has been a pleasure to observe different views on how to approach Climate Action at the national level. Also, more used to research and academia, it is always interesting to see the business sector's point of view as well.

Among many other sessions, I was able to learn about green taxonomy, reporting, water governance and sustainable entrepreneurship.
