> In the name of the God of Rainbow


I’m writing this post, better say, my first post, in days of being upset for the kid, Kiyan Peerfalak, and the phrase “In the name of the God of Rainbow” was used by him. (In lots of notes, its written "Kian Pirfalak” but I used Google Translate to check the pronunciation)

I dont know maybe this post is my mind trick to escape from the reality, but what ever is this, it doesnt come from a good feeling.

Lets come back to the topic


This is my first post in my personal website and I want to explain the idea behind my personal website and my blog


## Why `pages.dev`


If you type [`pages.dev`](http://pages.dev) and hit enter, you will get into [`pages.cloudflare.com`](http://pages.cloudflare.com) but what is Cloudflare Pages?!


> Cloudflare Pages is a JAMstack platform for frontend developers to collaborate and deploy websites.


And so far, Cloudflare is the most popular CDN provider with a bunch of free features, so _why create my own site and put it behind Cloudflare?!!! Deploy it ON Cloudflare_ 😎


Hmmmm, what is JAMstack?


> **Jamstack**, previously stylized as **JAMStack**, is a [web development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development) [architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture) pattern and [solution stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack). The initialism "JAM" stands for [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) and [Markup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) (generated by a [static site generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator)) and was coined by [Mathias Biilmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathias_Biilmann) in 2015. The idea of combining using JavaScript, APIs, and markup together has existed since the beginnings of [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5).


	In Jamstack websites, the [application logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_logic)  typically resides on the client side (for example, an embedded e-commerce checkout service that interacts with pre-rendered static 
	content), without being tightly coupled to a [backend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backend_(computing)) server. Jamstack sites are usually served with a [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)-based or [headless CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_content_management_system).
	~ wikipedia


[jamstack.org](https://jamstack.org/) says:


> Jamstack is an architectural approach that decouples the web experience layer from data and business logic, improving flexibility, scalability, performance, and maintainability.


	Jamstack removes the need for business logic to dictate the web experience.


	It enables a composable architecture for the web where custom logic and 3rd party services are consumed through APIs.


After all, struggling with infrastructure (eg. pure Linux, webservers, blogging platforms like wordpress, unpredictable traffics and so on) is time consuming and I dont really like to deal with them again 😬 so, in JAMstack, everything is ready, you only have to focus on writing and and blog.


The same thing is true about IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)<d-footnote>In simple word, its like a VPS but based on cloud software and possibility to rent hourly</d-footnote> and PaaS (Platform as a Service)<d-footnote>To know more search about Docker and Containers</d-footnote> which I will create a small post about Docker later in my [Blog](https://blog.alerezaa.ir)
