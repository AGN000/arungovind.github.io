Please join me at the upcoming talk _Digital Humanities and Soviet Cultural Institutions: The Case of the Gorky Literary Institute_, which takes place online this Friday, December 9, at 3:00-4:15 PM (EST).

In my talk, I will demonstrate various digital methods that can be used for analysis of cultural institutions, journals, and large corpora of texts using the case of the Gorky Literary Institute - the alma mater of numerous Soviet and international writers. The activities of the institute will be examined with the help of network analysis, text analysis, and mapping. 

The talk is a part of [Gazeta Speaker Series](https://gazetaworkshop.hcommons.org/).

I would like to thank the organizers [Yelizaveta Raykhlina](https://www.yelizavetaraykhlina.com/) and [Ala Graff](https://www.alacgraff.com/) for the invitation.

If you are interested in coming, please email gazeta.workshop@gmail.com to receive the Zoom link.
