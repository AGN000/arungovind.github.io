This week I had the pleasure of visiting the Deasyl Innovation Green Chemistry facilities in Geneva where we defined next steps in my PhD research. I am eager to analyse their biodiesel production process from used cooking oil (UCO) with an heterogeneous catalyst and the valorisation of waste glycerol.

In addition, I had the opportunity to assist to one batch production of calcium zincate in the easylZinc pilot plant in Sainte-H√©l√®ne-du-Lac. It has been a pleasure to see in action the process I assessed in my last published <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.161094">article</a>.

Merci aux personnes de <a href="https://deasyl.com/">Deasyl SA</a> et <a href="http://easyl.fr/">EasylZinc</a> avec qui j'ai partag√© ces journ√©es pour l'invitation.
