I am trying to organize an ASEEES panel on Soviet-Eastern European (or maybe specifically East German) cultural exchanges and looking for potential presenters.

In my presentation, I will talk about exchange visits between the Gorky Literary Institute in Moscow and Institut f√ºr Literatur "Johannes R. Becher" in Leipzig which took place in the 1970s and 1980s. I need at least two more people who could also present. If you have anyone in mind, please let me know.

The [convention](https://www.aseees.org/convention?fbclid=IwAR34SlGIJ1Yyxf3sr5E70bCJYd_BBD3tOw0LP7_YRVzKz61v7R8Sps2315o) will take place in Philadelphia, on November 30 - December 3, 2023.
