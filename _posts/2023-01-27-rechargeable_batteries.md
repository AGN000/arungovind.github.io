I am thrilled to announce the publication of my recent paper (Open access), <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.161094">'Life cycle assessment on calcium zincate production methods for rechargeable batteries', in the journal: Science of the Total Environment (STOTEN).

As reported in its corresponding <a href="https://www.esciupfnews.com/2023/01/10/lca-calcium-zincate-production-paper/">EsciNews</a>. In this study, we compare the environmental impacts of two calcium zincate production methods - the hydro-micro-mechanical process (HMMS) and the hydro-thermal synthesis (HTS) - using life cycle assessment (LCA). The results of the LCA show that HMMS is a more environmentally friendly option, with improvements of 97% in global warming compared to HTS. In addition, laboratory tests indicate that HMMS produces calcium zincate with a higher reaction surface area and faster battery activation.

I would like to acknowledge the contributions of my colleagues from the <a href="https://www.esci.upf.edu/en/unesco-chair-in-life-cycle-and-climate-change/catedra-introduction">UNESCO Chair in Life Cycle and Climate Change ESCI-UPF</a>, <a href="https://deasyl.com/">Deasyl Innovation Green Chemistry</a>, and <a href="http://easyl.fr/">easylZinc</a>.

This research highlights the importance of considering the full life cycle of chemical processes and substances, and the potential for HMMS to be a low-cost, safer alternative to lithium-based batteries in the quest for a green energy transition.
