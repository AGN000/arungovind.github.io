## Probelm Statement
In order to study the ["*coupling  instability of low mass-ratio partitioned FSI simulations*"](https://jtgonzo.github.io/) I first needed to develop a robust partitioned numerical framework to experiment on a series of challenging FSI problems. To this end, after much struggling and wondering in the dark, I was **FINALLY** able to develop a suite of 2D and 3D high-fidelity [partitioned FSI codes](](https://github.com/JTGonzo/Partitioned_FSI)). Achieveing this feat is a source of real personal pride; as without proper guidance or an intimate knowledge of the fundamental instability intrinsic to the problem, great effort  was required (often involving numerous ptotracted periods of brutal trial and error) to amass a complete and homogenous set of numerical tools to tackle this difficult problem.

In the end (having experimented on the gamut of available open-source resources) the majority of the code-based was derived from a parallel source [(redbKIT-based) monolithic FSI](https://github.com/JTGonzo/Monolithic_FSI) solver. These solvers were decomposed from the original [toolkit](https://github.com/redbKIT/redbKIT) into their baseline elements and were then strategically reassembled and further built upon until a sufficiently robust **partitioned** FSI scheme was attained.

## Framework Validation
To validate the accuracy of the developed partitioned framework, I compared my results for three challenging FSI benchmarks againts those presented in the literature and that produced by established software. The results served mainly to demonstrate the accuracy of the domain solvers themselves and, generally speaking, the robustness of the scheme to handle complex FSI problems with strong added-mass effects, high structural nonlinearity, and considerable mesh deformation. The benchmarks successfully reproduced included;

<ins>**Benchmark Cases**</ins><br>
<ul>
    <li> 2D Incompressible Flow over a Cantilevered Elastic Beam</li>
    <li> 3D Pressure Pulse Propogation through an Elastic Tube</li>
</ul>

details of this validation procedure and the deinitive results generated are given on this website's companion [projects](https://jtgonzo.github.io/projects/) page.
