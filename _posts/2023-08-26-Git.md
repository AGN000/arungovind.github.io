This theme implements a built-in Jekyll feature, the use of Rouge, for syntax highlighting.
It supports more than 100 languages.
This example is in C++.
All you have to do is wrap your code in markdown code tags:

* Git Basics
````markdown
```git
git add .
git commit -m "Why I did this change"
git push <remote> <branch> OR git push origin master
Project history:
# See the list of all the commits that have done so far ïƒ¨ git log git lg
```
````
* New Features
````markdown
```git
When you want to start a new feature.
You have to create a new branch to work from:
(master) git status (CLEAN)
(master) git checkout -b my-feature
(my-feature) git add .
(my-feature) git commit -m 'XXXX'
(my-feature) git push origin my-feature
(my-feature) git status (CLEAN)
(my-feature) gh repo view --web
# GO CREATE A PULL REQUEST ON GITHUB
(my-feature) git checkout master
(master)     git pull origin master
(master)     git sweep
(master)     git checkout -b my-new-feature
```
````
* Getting latest changes
````markdown
```git
When you want to get the latest changes from master on your branch:
(my-feature) git add .
(my-feature) git commit -m 'XXXX'
(my-feature) git status (CLEAN)
(my-feature) git checkout master
(master)     git pull origin master
(master)     git checkout my-feature
(my-feature) git merge master
```
