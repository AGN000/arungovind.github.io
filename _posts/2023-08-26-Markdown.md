This Markdown cheat sheet provides a quick overview of all the Markdown syntax elements. It can’t cover every edge case, so if you need more information about any of these elements, refer to the reference guides for [basic syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) and [extended syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax).

## Basic Syntax

These are the elements outlined in John Gruber’s original design document. All Markdown applications support these elements.

```markdown
> ##### WARNING
>
> This is a warning, and thus should
> be used when you want to warn the user
{: .block-warning }
```

> ##### WARNING
>
> This is a warning, and thus should
> be used when you want to warn the user
{: .block-warning }

```markdown
> ##### DANGER
>
> This is a danger zone, and thus should
> be used carefully

## Table of contents

To add a table of contents to a post, simply add
```yml
toc:
  beginning: true
```
to the front matter of the post. The table of contents will be automatically generated from the headings in the post.
If you want to learn more about how to customize the table of contents, you can check the [jekyll-toc](https://github.com/toshimaru/jekyll-toc) repository.

## Table of contents sidebar

To add a table of contents to a post as a sidebar, simply add
```yml
toc:
  sidebar: left
```
to the front matter of the post. The table of contents will be automatically generated from the headings in the post. If you wish to display the sidebar to the right, simply change `left` to `right`.

If you want to learn more about how to customize the table of contents of your sidebar, you can check the [bootstrap-toc](https://afeld.github.io/bootstrap-toc/) documentation. Notice that you can even customize the text of the heading that will be displayed on the sidebar.
