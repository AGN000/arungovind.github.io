This Markdown cheat sheet provides a quick overview of all the Markdown syntax elements. It can’t cover every edge case, so if you need more information about any of these elements, refer to the reference guides for [basic syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) and [extended syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax).

## Basic Syntax

These are the elements outlined in John Gruber’s original design document. All Markdown applications support these elements.

> related to a certain content.
{: .block-tip }
```

> ##### TIP
>
> A tip can be used when you want to give advice
> related to a certain content.
{: .block-tip }

```markdown
> ##### WARNING
>
> This is a warning, and thus should
> be used when you want to warn the user
{: .block-warning }
```

> ##### WARNING
>
> This is a warning, and thus should
> be used when you want to warn the user
{: .block-warning }

```markdown
> ##### DANGER
>
> This is a danger zone, and thus should
> be used carefully
{: .block-danger }
```
