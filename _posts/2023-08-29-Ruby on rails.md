Ruby on rails is a web application framework written in Ruby. It is a MVC framework that provides default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages. It encourages and facilitates the use of web standards such as JSON or XML for data transfer, and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for display and user interfacing.
