description: What I learnt in 2023

Here's a few things I learnt in 2023 (or haven't mentioned before):
  - Found that some folks use manual air bumps to inflate their car tires. I have a tire inflator with a sealant ([example](https://www.griotsgarage.com/12v-tire-inflator-and-repair-system/)) and put it in my trunk; it also inflates tires.
