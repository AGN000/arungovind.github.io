My first non-reading assignment in my data science master’s program was to write Python code that created the output of “Hello World.” This was, I later learned, a standard first assignment in basically every coding language, the purpose being to show in a very simple, easy, straightforward way that what you code does something. It was, I also found out, typically done as a single line, like this:

```python
print("Hello World")
```

That was not what my code looked like. It looked like this:
```python
def print_hello(name):
    print('Hello, ' + name + '!')

print_hello('World')
```
As I recall, I cried while writing that. It did not feel simple, or easy, or straightforward.. I didn’t understand what I was doing and I didn’t totally understand why this worked, though today I look at this a go, “Why the heck did I do it that way?” and I know exactly how it works and why. But Today Me did not exist in November of 2020 when I wrote that code. At the start of my program, my experience with any code was spending a few weeks on Codecademy playing with SQL as I determined whether or not I wanted to get a degree in data science.

This first assignment had me seriously questioning my life choices. Why did I decide to get another masters degree (aside from the satisfaction of having “even” degrees – BA, MA, BS, MS)? Why this degree? Why couldn’t I have been satisfied with accounting/audit/tax? I told myself I was not cut out for this, that I should quit, that I shouldn’t want more because I had a stable job that paid me decently.

That’s a lot of feelings for “Hello World.” If you’ve been coding for a while, I assume you’re currently rolling in laughter because those feelings and thoughts I was having are quite dramatic for such a simple assignment. But here’s the thing – I had those same feelings during every single assignment in my program. Every week, every class, every assignment, from Hello World to image identification and classification using TensorFlow. But here’s the other thing – I learned. I learned there are probably at least six ways of doing anything in coding, and some of them are more straightforward than others and some make more sense in my brain than others. I learned, for the first time in my life, what it was to be challenged and wondered how people who felt challenged regularly in high school and college got through it. I learned the importance of terminology and understanding how a program and computer think. I learned that much like how I learned math (backwards – I am still better at multiplication and division than addition and subtraction), I understand code in the same way. The simple things, to me, often do not make sense the first time around because I don’t understand where it’s going or why or how, and that’s ok. I’ll just cry a little because learning can be frustrating, but the sheer joy at success of an error-free code is like nothing I’ve experienced.

We’ll come back to my first assignment later and talk about what it’s doing and why it worked. For now, know that if you have never coded a line of anything in your life, you can do it. There are resources. You don’t need to make it as hard for yourself as I did for myself.

Hello World, indeed.
