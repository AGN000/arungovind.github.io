In this tutorial, we'll explore how to utilize LangChain, LM Studio, and FAISS to create a chat interface for interacting with Github repositories. This project will involve cloning a Github repo using GitLoader from LangChain, splitting the repository into chunks of text with a recursive text splitter, creating a vector database for these split documents using FAISS, and connecting user queries to a local LM Studio for answering questions about the repository. Finally, we'll deploy the project using Docker and create a Streamlit app where users can supply a Github repo and ask questions about it.

#### Cloning Github Repo with LangChain's GitLoader
We'll start by utilizing LangChain's GitLoader to clone the desired Github repository. This allows us to access the repository's contents programmatically.

{::nomarkdown}
{% assign jupyter_path = "assets/jupyter/gitload_1.ipynb" | relative_url %}
{% capture notebook_exists %}{% file_exists assets/jupyter/gitload_1.ipynb %}{% endcapture %}
{% if notebook_exists == "true" %}
{% jupyter_notebook jupyter_path %}
{% else %}

<p>Sorry, the notebook you are looking for does not exist.</p>
{% endif %}
{:/nomarkdown}

Note: repo_path is the path to save the cloned repo and branch is the branch of the repo to be cloned. 

#### Splitting Repo into Text Chunks
Next, we'll use a recursive text splitter to divide the repository's contents into manageable text chunks. This step is crucial for processing and analyzing large volumes of text efficiently.
{::nomarkdown}
{% assign jupyter_path = "assets/jupyter/gitload_2.ipynb" | relative_url %}
{% capture notebook_exists %}{% file_exists assets/jupyter/gitload_2.ipynb %}{% endcapture %}
{% if notebook_exists == "true" %}
{% jupyter_notebook jupyter_path %}
{% else %}

<p>Sorry, the notebook you are looking for does not exist.</p>
{% endif %}
{:/nomarkdown}

#### Creating Vector Database with FAISS
Once we have the text chunks, we'll create a vector database using FAISS. FAISS is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. Each text chunk will be converted into a vector representation, enabling fast and accurate retrieval of relevant information.

{::nomarkdown}
{% assign jupyter_path = "assets/jupyter/gitload_3.ipynb" | relative_url %}
{% capture notebook_exists %}{% file_exists assets/jupyter/gitload_3.ipynb %}{% endcapture %}
{% if notebook_exists == "true" %}
{% jupyter_notebook jupyter_path %}
{% else %}

<p>Sorry, the notebook you are looking for does not exist.</p>
{% endif %}
{:/nomarkdown}

#### Connecting User Queries to LM Studio
Users will interact with the chat interface by supplying questions about the Github repository. These queries will be connected to a local instance of LM Studio, a powerful language model fine-tuned for generating human-like responses. LM Studio will provide answers to the user's questions based on the information stored in the vector database.

#### Building Streamlit App and Docker Deployment
Finally, we'll build a user-friendly Streamlit app where users can input the Github repository and their questions. The app will communicate with the backend components, including LangChain, FAISS, and LM Studio, to provide seamless interaction. We'll containerize the entire project using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.

By following this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate cutting-edge natural language processing and machine learning technologies to create a sophisticated chat interface for exploring Github repositories.

Stay tuned for the upcoming steps and code snippets to implement each component of the project!
