This week I had an amazing opportunity to attend (Data Point Prague)[https://datapointprague.cz/]. I've attended other in-person conferences, but only for accounting, and I've attended many virtual data meetups, but this was my first time at an in-person data conference. It was everything I could have hoped for.

Women - I use this loosely to indicate anyone who identifies as or presents as female in this instance - don't often have a great time in the workplace or at conferences. We're often overlooked, undervalued, talked over, belittled, and generally made to feel as though our contributions and thoughts don't matter. We are paid less, endure sexual harrassment, and are more prone to having male collegues steal credit for our work and ideas. Conferences can run the risk of reflecting our workplace experiences, but with even less recourse for handling those situations. If a conference attendee harassess a woman, they might get banned from future conferences, but it makes no actual difference in their career. This was the first instance where there was a slide at the beginning of the conference that specifically outlined behavioral expectations. Ten points to the conference organizers!

My experience was nothing short of happy. The conference took place at the Microsoft offices in Prague, and there were three stages running at a time. I'll say that the only downside was that I couldn't attend every single talk! The keynote speakers were Alberto Ferarri of (SQLBI)[https://www.sqlbi.com/author/alberto-ferrari/] and Pawel Potasinski, Sr Program Manager at Microsoft.

These are the talks I attended:
* (Erik Svenson)[https://eriksvensen.wordpress.com/] - A delightful Power BI concert  
* (Nikola Ilic)[https://data-mozart.com/] - From XL to S - Reduce your Power BI model size by 90%!  
* (Augustin Dokoza Bukvic)[https://thepowerinsights.com/] - Citizen data analyst hitchiker guide to Power BI  
* (James Bartlett)[https://datavolume.xyz/] - The Data Dojo: A Power BI Community of Practice  
* (Gregor Brunner)[https://en.brunner.bi/blog] - Best practices for developing Power BI reports  
* (Benni de Jagere)[https://bennidejagere.com/] - Star Schema ALL the things! But why?

Erik's talk was like playtime with Power BI and Power Apps and I probably had the most fun in that talk because it was so playful while also teaching a useful skill. From Nikola and Benni I learned more about how to think like Power BI thinks. I've known the basics for ages (reduce dimensionality and row count as much as you can as early as possible, use functions, etc.) but these two talks really helped me get a better grasp of how and why Power BI "thinks" and processes information the way it does. Augustin highlighted the importance of terminology and considering how you talk about Power BI with non-technical users/consumers. Gregor discussed some concepts to keep in mind when creating reports that tied into three areas: Power Query, Data Modeling and DAX, and visuals. The overarching idea being to consider how to create reports and dashboards that will look clean, be performative, and be long-lasting. James discussed his experiences with peaks and pitfalls of organizing a Power BI community of practice so others hoping to do something similar in their workplace could avoid some of the issues he ran into while making note of some of the things that they might want to consider to be successful.

And my presence was not discounted in any way. There are really only two words to describe my experience: sheer joy.
