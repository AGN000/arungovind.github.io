As the Education Scholar for UVA's SASCO Center, a U54 Center funded by the NIH, I was tasked with creating a video introducing clinicans to systems biology. In the end, I made a video focusing on three main things:
1. **__What__ is systems biology?** Systems biology is difficult to define, so I explore the history of the term and interview UVA scientists to determine a cohesive definition of the field.
2. **__Why__ do we need systems approaches in cancer?** Because cancer is a complex system, reductionist approaches are not enough to figure out why things go wrong, such as adaptive resistance. 
3. **__How__ do systems approaches get used in the clinic today?** While systems biology is a relatively new field, some successes have already made their way through clinical trials and are influencing treatment today, such as adaptive therapy approaches.
