This project forms the bulk of my PhD thesis work. We are actively collected gene expression profiles from global cohorts of suspected sepsis patients (collaborating hospitals are in Australia, Canada, Colombia, England, Netherlands, Uganda, and USA). Specifically, I am applying various unsupervised learning methods to identify clinically relevant subgroups using gene expression data. I have also been using LASSO logistic regression to derive a sparse classification model which can be implemented in clinics. 

Interestingly, our lab received a grant to implement similar strategies in patients with sepsis due to SARS-CoV-2.
