In this work I explore debates surrounding statistical reform in psychology and neuroscience, with a particular interest in how these debates play into notions of evidence. I'm also interested in the role of machine learning in the analysis of social, behavioural, and neuroscientific, and how these analytic startergies align with the explanatory goals in these sciences.
