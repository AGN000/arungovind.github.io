Location obfuscation, which allows mobile users to report obfuscated locations instead of the exact locations, has been a dominating location privacy protection paradigm in many location-based services. Yet, the current obfuscation designs fail to address the vulnerabilities of vehicles, of which the mobility is restricted by the underlying road networks and traffic conditions. Particularly, individual vehicles’ mobility is restricted by various road environments, including local road network topology, speed limits, and traffic conditions. Built upon this insight, in this project, our objective is to 1) demonstrate that, with the road network environment and historical traffic flow information provided, vehicles’ trajectory can be inferred with high accuracy even their reported locations have been obfuscated, 2) propose a new location obfuscation paradigm to protect vehicles’ location privacy considering the vehicles’ mobility features over roads, and 3) develop, deploy, test, and refine the geo-obfuscation methods in dynamic location-based applications.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

<div class="caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/" target="_blank">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
```
