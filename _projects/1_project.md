This project involves developing an agent that autonomously plays a mnk-type game on a 7x7 board, with the goal of forming a line of four consecutive pieces (similar to the classic “Connect 4” or “3 in a row”). Using tree theory and decision-making algorithms, the agent must face simulated or real opponents with a performance comparable to that of a person.

**Project Features:**    

**- Development language:** Matlab.   

**- Implemented techniques:** Search and decision-making algorithms such as minimax and variants, as well as Monte Carlo trees and other optimization methods.   

**- Evaluation:** The agent's performance will be measured both in simulated games and in defense practice, where it must demonstrate its ability to compete against other agents.   

**- Additional challenges:** The agent must comply with efficiency and accuracy restrictions to ensure that it plays intelligently, respecting the rules and response times.

    The requirements are that it has to be 2 players, that one loses points and the other wins, and that it has to be played on time.
