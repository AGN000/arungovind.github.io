## Deep Neural Networks

Deep Neural Networks are the "Artificial Intelligence" behind breakthroughs in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Speech Recognition. If you've unlocked your phone with your face, used smart assistants, or used a machine translation service, you have used applications of DNNs in one of these fields. Although state-of-the-art DNN models create these breakthroughs, they do so at great cost &mdash; in time, hardware and energy costs. This is a problem for the field since it makes further research expensive, and inaccessible.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.

    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
