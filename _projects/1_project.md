ZeroTwo focuses on studying the digital environment of Mexico. In particular, we use the [Twitter API v2](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api) to study hourly trends on the social network. Additionally, we automate the generation of trend volume visualization images and post them on our [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/ZTSAnalytics).
