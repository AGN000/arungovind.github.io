<b>Summary</b>: Water vapor and droplets play a critical role in Earth's geological, oceanic, and atmospheric environments, with molecular solvation driving processes such as mineral dissolution, metal transport, and ore formation. Water vapor significantly impacts solvation behavior and the mobility of metals, with recent studies revealing a complex multi-phase system of water clusters and nanodroplets that interact and solvate metal ions. Understanding the solvation behavior of metals like gold and copper in such nanodroplets is essential for comprehending metal solubility and mobility in hydrothermal ore vapors.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/17308120_I.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
