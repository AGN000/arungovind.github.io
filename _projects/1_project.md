Businesses need to be able to segment their customer base into clusters and tailor experiences for each customer segment. A company may segment their customers according to demographics like age, gender, marital status, location, or buying habits.

By segmenting customers, a company can—

1. Create and communicate targeted marketing messages that will resonate more with a particular segment
2. Find the best communication channel for a segment
3. Establish stronger customer relationships
4. Identify which segments are particularly profitable.


Hitting the average does not mean hitting the majority. Modern marketplaces require companies to provide tailored experiences to a diverse set of customers.
