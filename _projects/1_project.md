Bacteriological Characteristics, Antibiotic Resistance And Some Facilities Factors Related
To Patients With Urinary Tract Infections at Hoan My Sai Gon Hospital In 2022. 


Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the common infections and is a matter of concern to the health sector due to its high incidence and recurrence rate. The most common UTIs among healthcare-associated infections were reported in many reports with an infection rate of 12.9% and two-thirds of which were catheter-related.

UTIs are tending to develop complicatedly in the direction of multi-resistant bacteria against
many drugs including new generation drugs.

In addition, the empiric antibiotic indications is still low compared to the guideline of treatment of UTI and the antibiogram results is 71.4% (reported in Urology Department of Ho Chi Minh University of Medicine and Pharmacy). Significant amount of inappropriate antibiotic is used in the treatment of UTIs in the emergency department.

Correct diagnosis and correct antibiotic treatment are the first steps to reducing multidrug resistance and shortening the length of hospital stay for patients.

Hoan My Saigon Hospital annually records many cases of urinary tract infections with positive results and antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

Updating the situation of pathogenic bacteria, the multi-antibiotic resistance model is very important to help doctors update the treatment direction of UTIs for patients at the hospital.

Therefore, we conducted a study with the topic "Bacteria characteristics, antibiotic resistance and some factors related to urinary tract infection patients at Hoan My Saigon Hospital in 2022" with the following objectives:

1/ Survey on bacterial characteristics and antibiotic resistance of bacteria causing urinary tract infections at Hoan My Saigon hospital in 2022.

2/ Find out the correlation of some factors and treatment time of urinary tract infection patients at Hoan My Saigon hospital in 2022.
