People often indicate certain messages on social media rather than directly say them. For instance, saying 'the movie is fine' tends to mean that it is not amazing. Generation of the such implicatures depends on various factors. My master's thesis focuses on investigating what factors cause humans to generate such implicatures, and whether transformer models can make the same decisions.
