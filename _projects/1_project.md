Metabolomics is an emerging field of "omics" research specializing in the near global analysis of small molecules found in biosystems.

Just as genomics is the study of DNA and genetic information within a cell, and transcriptomics is the study of RNA and differences in mRNA expression; metabolomics is the study of substrates and products of metabolism, which are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors.

Metabolomics is a **powerful** approach because metabolites and their concentrations, unlike other "omics" measures, directly reflect the underlying biochemical activity and state of cells / tissues/biosystems. Collectively, these small molecules and their interactions within a biological system are known as the metabolome.Metabolome closely relates to and best represents the molecular phenotype.

<!--- The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above: -->

<!--- {% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %} -->
