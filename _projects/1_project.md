Metabolomics is an emerging field of "omics" research specializing in the near global analysis of small molecules found in biosystems. 

- <a href="https://github.com/TuoooLiu666/expense-tracker">Urinary Metabolomics in Tucson Firefighters: Pre-, and Post-fire exposure</a>:
  - aims: Characterizing & compare metabolic profiles before and post fire exposure
  - data source: Fire Fighter Cancer Cohort Study(<a href="https://ffccs.org">FFCCS</a>)
  - research question: Does fire exposure alter the metabolic profiles in firefighters?


- <a href="https://github.com/TuoooLiu666/expense-tracker">Urinary Metabolomics in Tucson Firefighters: differential metabolome by Hispanic ethnicity</a>:
  - aims: Characterizing differential metabolome by Hispanic ethnicity, before and post fire exposure
  - data source: Fire Fighter Cancer Cohort Study(<a href="https://ffccs.org">FFCCS</a>)
  - research question: Is there a difference in the metabolic profiling between Hispanic and Non-Hispanic firefighters? Is the difference strengthened by fire exposure?

<!--- The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above: -->

<!--- {% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %} -->
