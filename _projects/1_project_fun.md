This library is made of oak. It was built in 2023 during the summer after the bootcamp. It takes me 7 days full-time to build it. 2 meters high, 1.15 meter wide and 26 centimeters deep, it has 6 shelves. No screws, no glue, only dovetails. it was quite a challenge to build it. No mistakes were allowed.


It is located in the living room of my secondary house. Please, do abstraction of the mess around it. I am still working on the house.

    Firstly, I made a sketch of the library on Fusion 360, helping me to calculate the dimensions of the different parts that i needed.

    I bought the wood at the lumber yard. This is really an experience. A lot of wood, a lot of different species, a lot of smells and noises. I chose oak because it is a hard wood and it is beautiful. Had to drive really slowly to go back home. Some pieces were 3 meters long and outside of the trunk of the car.
