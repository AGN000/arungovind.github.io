This library is made of oak. It was built in 2023 during the summer after the bootcamp. It takes me 7 days full-time to build it. 2 meters high, 1.15 meter wide and 26 centimeters deep, it has 6 shelves. No screws, no glue, only dovetails. it was quite a challenge to build it. No mistakes were allowed.


It is located in the living room of my house. It is used to store books, CDs and DVDs. It is a very useful piece of furniture.
