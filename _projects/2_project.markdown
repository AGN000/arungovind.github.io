This part of my research would be focused on develop novel battery electrode materials to replace the state-of-art NMC, NCA or LCO materials given that such materials require a large amount of Co mineral production, which would lead to both price and supply issues due to the rapidly increasing demand for battery materials, such as electric vehicles.
