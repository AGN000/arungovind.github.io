SeptiSearch is an R Shiny App highlighting genes commonly differentially expressed in sepsis patients. The database and app was largely created by a summer student, Jasmine Tam, who I supervised during her tenure in the Hancock lab. I am actively adding to the database and further developing the app for publication. The app is not currently active, however, the repository is available [here](https://github.com/abaghela/curation).
