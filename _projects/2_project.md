This folder commits to the application of biostatistics knowledge on clinical, randomized trials and observational studies. Study goals include: 
- write a good statistical analysis plan
- understand the obstacles when dealing real-world data
- experience biomedical/research statistical analyses
- excel various analytical models

Code and raw datasets are placed in <a href="https://github.com/TuoooLiu666/Applied-Biostatistics-Projects">this Github repository</a>

- <a href="https://github.com/TuoooLiu666/Applied-Biostatistics-Projects/tree/main/proj1">Proj 1</a>:
  - analytics: logistic regression model, build & interpretation
  - data source: Framingham longitudinal heart study
  - research question: Does quitting smoking reduce the likelihood of incident cardiovascular disease?
  
- <a href="https://github.com/TuoooLiu666/Applied-Biostatistics-Projects/tree/main/proj2">Proj 2</a>:
  - analytics: survey data analysis with weights
  - data source: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017-2018 data
  - research question: Is vaping associated with increased blood lead levels? Is there effect modification by age or gender?

- <a href="https://github.com/TuoooLiu666/Applied-Biostatistics-Projects/tree/main/proj3">Proj 3</a>:
  - analytics: longitudinal data analysis & missing data imputation
  - data source: longitudinal data from study "A Phase 3 placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-site trial of the alpha-2-adrenergic agonist, lofexidine, for opioid withdrawal"
  - research question: 
    - Is there group difference between the treatment group and placebo group with respect to MHOWS (parallel group response profiles)?
    - Is there any time effect?
  
- <a href="https://github.com/TuoooLiu666/Applied-Biostatistics-Projects/tree/main/proj4">Proj 4</a>:
  - analytics: propensity score matching and outcome analysis 
  - data source: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Data I Epidemiologic Follow Up Study (NHEFS) 1971&1982 follow-up data
  - research question: Is there an effect of smoking cessation on weight gain?

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %} --->
