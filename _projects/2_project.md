Altogether with the <a href="https://www.esci.upf.edu/en/unesco-chair-in-life-cycle-and-climate-change/catedra-introduction">UNESCO Chair in Life Cycle and Climate Change ESCI-UPF</a>, we form a team specialized in helping businesses measure their environmental impact through various assessments such as carbon footprint, environmental footprint, and life cycle assessment for both products and organizations.

We work closely with clients to develop tailored solutions that not only measure their environmental impact but also provide actionable recommendations for reducing their carbon footprint and improving sustainability. We believe that businesses have a critical role to play in mitigating the impact of climate change, and we are committed to working with them to achieve their sustainability goals.

Our services are designed to be comprehensive and adaptable to the needs of each client. Whether you are a small business looking to reduce your carbon footprint or a large organization seeking to improve your sustainability practices, we can provide the expertise and support you need.

We pride ourselves on our commitment to quality, accuracy, and transparency in all our assessments. We use the latest scientific methods and industry standards to ensure that our clients receive reliable and meaningful data. Our team also prioritizes clear communication throughout the assessment process, ensuring that clients understand their results and are equipped to take action.

We love collaborating with private industry to achieve a more sustainable future!
