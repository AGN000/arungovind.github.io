In our course project for <a href='https://mech-design.github.io/'> Applied Mechanism Design for Social Good</a> at the University of Maryland,
our group sought to maximize user engagement by advertisers in a social network. Within these networks, there are a handful of
users, often called influencers, followed by a large number of users (this is common on Instagram or X).
Within our proposed setting, we aim to use observations from any related followers to better select ads for an influencer.
