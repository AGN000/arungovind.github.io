Serial Verb Constructions (SVCs) exist in Mandarin Chinese and the Lianyungang dialect. Although these two dialects use same word order and lexical resources for SVCs, Mandarin Chinese does not allow the extraction of the object in some SVCs, while the Lianyungang dialect allows so. Exisiting theoretical framework in the syntactic structure of such SVCs cannot explain this phenomenon. I provide a new syntactic structure in my paper to account for this divergence.
