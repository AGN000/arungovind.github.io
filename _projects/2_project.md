<b>Summary</b>: The study of molecular hydration, an emerging field in Earth Sciences, is essential for under-standing geochemical processes in the upper crust, particularly metal transport. As water rises buoyantly through the crust and undergoes boiling, its capacity to form hydration shells around other molecules changes, affecting the mobility of metals such as cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg). Investigating the structure, stability, and hydration shell of Cd- and Hg-containing complexes and clusters is critical for comprehending their size-dependent properties, and consequently, their transport and deposition chemistry in ore-forming processes. The aim of this project is to examine the water hydration structure surrounding cadmium and mercury complexes, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of the physico-chemical properties of these geochemically significant metal species.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
