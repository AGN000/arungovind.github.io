This folder commits to the application of biostatistics knowledge on clinical, randomized trials and observational studies. Study goals include: 
- write a good statistical analysis plan
- understand the obstacles when dealing real-world data
- experience biomedical/research statistical analyses
- excel various analytical models

Code and raw datasets are placed in <a href="https://github.com/TuoooLiu666/Applied-Biostatistics-Projects">this Github repository</a>
