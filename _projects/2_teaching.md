iZMath is a personal project inspired by the need of open education at different academic levels. This need increased during the COVID-19 crisis, specially on teens. A common complaint was that non-face-to-face classes in hard courses like Math were hard to follow at all. Thus, I frequently worked with small groups to level their knowledge and skills.

We're still working on different topics, but the main focus right now is to create a [MOOC](https://izmath.com) in Spanish available to everyone, with the addition of a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEAg8SkCW8XuRAYQRIb7ppg).

This project is still in development.
