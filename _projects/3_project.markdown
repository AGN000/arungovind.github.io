High entropy materials usually indicate the solid solutions of either ceramics or alloys that have more than 4 elements in a single site. Even with high-throughput screening, exhausting the periodic table using high-throughput DFT calculations will be impossible in some situations. In this part of my research, I am interested in understand the synthetic acessibility and physical properties of such an enourmous combinatorial space withe combination of high-throughput computation and machine learning techniques.
