The Framingham Heart Study started in 1948, is a long term on going cardiovascular cohort study on a sample of residents from the city of Framingham, Massachusetts and is currently in it's third generation of participants. Prior to that, very few facts were known about the epidemiology of hypertensive or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. While today, many conclusions were founded based on this study which relates heart diseases with diet, exercise, and common medications such as aspirin. 


In this paper, we will study the data set of the original cohort that consisted of 5,209 men and women. Requirements for entry were an age between 30 and 62 years at the time of first examination, with no history of heart attack or stroke. These volunteers were given a questionnaire and an exam every 2 years, starting in 1948. The data used has been collected from the exam results and questionnaire data in 1956 and whether a participant experienced a heart disease in the ten year period from 1956 to 1966. Our ultimate goal is to predict an individual's 10 year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD).
