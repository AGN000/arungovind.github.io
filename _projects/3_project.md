Graphs are a highly informative, flexible, and a natural way to represent data. Machine
Learning for graphs (MLG), whereby classical ML is generalized to irregular graph domains, has
enjoyed a recent renaissance, leading to a dizzying array of models and their applications in drug
design, Web and recommender systems, social networks, and many more. The key challenge in MLG is to effectively learn to encode 
discrete graph structure into low-dimensional vector representations or embeddings which are then used in various prediction tasks. 

The most popular GRL approaches include (i) random-walk based methods  which first transforms the graph into node sequences, in which, the co-occurrence of two nodes measures the structural distance between them; (ii) matrix-factorization based methods which uses low ranked
decomposition of some node similarity matrix as node embeddings; and (iii) graph neural networks
(GNNs) which encode graph structure directly in the latent representations via neighborhood aggregation strategies. While these methods have shown state of the art improvements in various node/edge/graph level tasks on graphs, there are still open questions about their effectiveness for datasets with varying structural and task properties. On the one hand, we develop new datasets and benchmarks to audit the learning capabilities of existing methods. On the other hand we focus on developing new methods specifically for graphs with certain structural properties and under certain task conditions.

Our recent work makes a deeper exploration into the overlooked domain of multi-label node classification within the realm of GraphML literature. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their prowess in node classification tasks on graphs, particularly in multi-class scenarios. However, the more prevalent and realistic scenario of multi-label node classification, where nodes can possess multiple labels, has received relatively limited attention. We focus on comprehensively analyzing the challenges associated with this domain, encompassing both the scarcity of suitable datasets and the limitations of existing methods, which have hindered progress in this area. Additionally, towards addressing the gaps in our understanding of multi-label node classification in graph data and pave the way for further advancements in this field we make valuable contributions, including the collection of real-world biological datasets, the development of a multi-label graph generator and redefinition of homophily for multi-label scenarios.
