        What do state-of-the-art deep learning and generative AI techniques teach us about cognition? They seem to millitate against a strongly nativist understanding of the mind in favor of a leaner cognitive architecture based on assosicationist learning. I am interested in better understanding the nature of emergent capacities for intelligent behavior in these systems. Probing these models may help us gain a better grasp on the nature of various competencies and their relationship with genuine understanding.
