<b>Summary</b>: Molecular association reactions between organic matter and aqueous metals Have so far received little attention in the Earth sciences, despite the fact that metal complexation reactions with organic ligands critically affect their mobility and ore deposition chemistry. Organo- and organosulfur compounds, with their affinity for metal ions like Au+ and metal ion complexes such as [AuCl2]+, are particularly interesting. These complexes contribute to metal mobility in metal sulfide deposits and are also of considerable interest in prebiotic chemistry given their ability to enhance oligomerisation reactions that are otherwise unfavourable. Theerefore, to better understand molecular-scale association reactions involving Au and Cu with organosulfur ligands, we have initiated a new experimental effort to investigate the structure and spectroscopic properties of Au- and Cu-organosulfur complexes in aqueous fluids. These type of spectroscopic experiments will shed light on their geochemical importance, but also on their role in early chemical evolution.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
