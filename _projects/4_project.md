I spent my undergraduate exploring my interests ranging from oceanography research in the North Atlantic to anthropologic work in Mongolia. I feel extremely fortunate that my undergraduate university, Wellesley College, prioritized unique learning experiences that helped me better understand my passions. I'm the sitting class president for the yellow class of 2019 and I am always keen to help a fellow sibling.
