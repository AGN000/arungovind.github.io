The Terres de l'Ebre region has been facing a challenge where a significant proportion of its residents have to leave their homes to work in urban centers like Tarragona or Barcelona. Consequently, a large number of people who live in these urban centers have secondary residences in the Ebro Delta, either through inheritance or investment. Unfortunately, as they live outside the region, they are unable to use these properties as tourist accommodations and make them profitable. This presents an opportunity to cater to this customer segment as there are no tourist accommodation management companies in the territory which take care of the following tasks (among others):
- Housekeeping and decor
- Check in and check out
- Administrative tasks (i.e. tourism accommodation license)
