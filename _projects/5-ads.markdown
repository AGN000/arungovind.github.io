<strong>Abstract</strong>

<p align="justify">

With the advent of intermediary commercial ad- networks in charge of optimizing ad selection with a twin goal of increasing revenue and improving user experience, it is preferable to have ads relevant to the web content than generic ones. This method of advertising is popularly known as Contextual Advertising. Advertising has become ubiquitous in the internet community and more so in the ever-growing and popular online video delivery websites (e.g. YouTube, Vimeo). Video advertising is becoming increasingly popular on these websites as it has the most user engagement levels. Our novel method automatically associates ads from an advertisement database and seamlessly recommends them at the appropriate time within each individual video in real-time. If a context switch occurs in the video a different relevant ad is placed. Ads are in the form of banners (containing visuals and text) and are placed beside a playing video. Unlike most video sites which treat video advertising as general text advertising by displaying general, contextually irrelevant video ads at the beginning, end and beside a playing video, our approach aims to recommend contextually relevant ads for a video stream taking into account the audio/speech aspect. Specifically, given a Web page containing an online video, our method is able to extract key- words/text in the form of phrases from the video segment, perform entity extraction on the phrase, detect and resolve ambiguous entities and finally place relevant ads.
