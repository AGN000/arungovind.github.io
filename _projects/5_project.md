This work examined patch antenna performance and manufacturing differences when producing dielectrically loaded patch antennas with 3-D printing. Patch antennas are popular antenna designs due to their small footprint, cheap manufacturing, and versatility in design. Two different areas of research with antennas are with 3-D printing and dielectric loading. The development of antennas using 3-D printing is of interest because it can be cheap, have a quick turnaround time in manufacturing, and allow for greater customization in designs. Additionally, dielectric loading, in which two different materials are integrated into the antenna to modify the performance, have been shown to enhance or customize performance, such as with radiation patterns and dual band operation.

Dielectric loading was incorporated into patch antenna design using materials that had dielectric constants that were approximately 2 and 9. Studies were performed on examining both the radiating and non-radiating slots of the antenna and controlling the 3-D printing qualities (such as infill) to modify the properties of the antenna materials. Experiments were performed on substrate characterization for individual substrate materials and integrated substrates and on antenna performance. It was found that dependent on loading conditions, unique behaviors could be designed for including double resonance, high gain, or wide bandwidth. 3-D printing can also be a useful tool, especially for patch antenna designs, to much more easily prototype more complex substrate designs.
