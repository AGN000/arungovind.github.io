Founded shortly in the post-covid era, with the ambition of accompanying the elderly to quality ageing in their homes by means of highly qualified and recommended professionals and with the use of new technologies.

My role in this project is the research and implementation of new technologies and innovative measures. As well as the open collaboration with other companies in the sector or with which we can create any kind of synergy that benefits our clients.
