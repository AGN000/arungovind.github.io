People sometimes convey social biases without even recognizing them. For instance, Chinese social media tend to address female professors as 'sexy female professor', while refer to male professors simply as 'professor'. The difference in titles encode stereotypes that appearance is more important than career to women, and that majority of professors are male. This project conducts a survey with 100 participants in Shanghai International Studies University. It is found that male participants are significantly less sensitive to recognize the biases encoded in the gendered expressions. They also use these expressions more often than females.
