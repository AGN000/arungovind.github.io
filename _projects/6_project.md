Chinese phrases in the form of 'V+N1+de+N2' are structurally ambiguous. They can be either interpreted as noun phrases, i.e. (V+N1+de)+N2, or verb phrases, i.e. V+(N1+de+N2). Although they can often be disambiguated in context, neural parsers still struggle to recognize the correct syntactic structures of them. This project collects 2,000 sentences with 'V+N1+de+N2' phrases and tested Stanza and LTP for their performance. It is found that LTP performs better in the identification task. We also propose to construct thematic dictionary as a post-hoc treatment to further improve parsers' performance.
