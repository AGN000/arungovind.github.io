Restriction site‐associated DNA sequencing (RAD‐seq) enables obtaining thousands of genetic markers for phylogenomic studies. However, RAD‐seq data are subject to allele dropout (ADO) due to polymorphisms at enzyme cutting sites. We developed a new pipeline, RAD‐seq Allele Dropout Remedy in our study of the gymnosperm genus, Torreya, to mitigate ADO in outgroups by recovering missing loci from previously published transcriptomes.
