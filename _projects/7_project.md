Chinese, English, and Korean all have noun phrases. This project investigates how to automate the workflow of noun phrase identification in the tagged corpora of these three languages to provide data for relevant linguistic studies. It is found that Chinese phrases in the form 'V+N1+de+N2' are especially problematic, which leads to the project 'Mandarin Chinese ‘V+N1+de+N2’ Structure Disambiguation in Syntactic Parsing'.
