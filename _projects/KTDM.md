Kidney transplantation is a life-saving procedure for people experiencing end-stage renal disease, offering patients freedom from the burdens of dialysis and significantly improved long-term health outcomes. Over the decades, medical advancements in transplant surgery and immunosuppression have made kidney transplantation safer and more successful, transforming what was once a highly experimental intervention into a routine form of therapy. However, despite these advances, the demand for donor kidneys continues to grow, and many patients remain on waiting lists for years while facing declining health.

A pressing challenge in the transplant community is the persistent shortage of optimal donor kidneys. Traditional donor criteria often exclude kidneys deemed “marginal”—those that come from older donors, donors with certain comorbidities, or other factors that could impact kidney function. Yet, with a limited organ supply, these marginal kidneys cannot be ignored; in fact, they offer a viable option for some patients who might otherwise never receive a transplant. Research suggests that even marginal kidneys can confer benefits over prolonged dialysis, particularly when managed carefully before and after the operation.

My goal is to focus on improving the utilization of such lower quality kidneys that are discarded at high rates. For this purpose, I will develop intelligent decision support systems that could facilitate the donor-recipient allocation decisions. This decision support has the potential to standardize, streamline and improve the decision process. In the broader context, successful utilization of marginal kidneys has multiple potential impacts. First, it could alleviate the strain on transplant waiting lists by offering more transplantable organs. Second, it may lead to more equitable access to transplants, ensuring that individuals who have been waiting the longest or have higher sensitivities can receive a donor organ without compromising on safety. Finally, advancing the science of marginal kidney transplantation could serve as a valuable model for optimizing the use of other marginal organs, helping the entire field of organ transplantation evolve and expand lifesaving opportunities for patients in need.
