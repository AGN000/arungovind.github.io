In this project, we investigate an orthopedic clinic at a children hospital in Canada, where patients require plaster care (including examination, casting, or cast removal) and are referred by the emergency department or privileged physicians. The clinic offers various cast types, encasing - but not limited to - upper extremity, lower extremity, body and cylinder. For instance, upper extremity refers to plaster care for arm, wrist, or hand, and lower extremity denotes plaster care for foot or leg.

We propose a proactive-reactive decision support tool (a two-stage approach), by which booking clerks can increase patient throughput and direct wait time in the clinic. In the proactive scheduling stage, the objective is to generate a robust schedule against known uncertainties, including service duration and new arrivals. In the second scheduling stage, the objective is to dynamically rectify the major disruptions occured in the clinic.
