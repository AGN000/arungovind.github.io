Building Production-Ready RAG Applications: A Journey Beyond Simple Implementations
The Challenge with RAG Applications
When we first approached building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application with a Telegram interface, we thought it would be straightforward. After all, the basic concept seems simple: store document chunks in a vector database, use embeddings for similarity search, and generate answers using an LLM.
However, reality proved more complex. The simplest approach - using fixed-length document chunks, non-fine-tuned embeddings, and GPT-3.5 - often produced underwhelming results: incorrect answers, missing context, and poor user experience.
