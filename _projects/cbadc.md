To complement the mainly theoretical findings of my [PhD thesis](https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000469192), I have released
a [python](https://www.python.org) software package called [cbadc](https://pypi.org/project/cbadc/). 
This software was intended to provide the means of doing high level **analysis** and **simulation** as well as
**computing the filter coefficients** for control-bounded A/D converters.


The software package has a comprehensive [documentation](https://cbadc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) where also the [installation instructions](https://cbadc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#installation) can be found. 
In addition to the [API documentation](https://cbadc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/api.html), there
is also a growing number of [examples and tutorials](https://cbadc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html) demonstrating
common use cases and capabilities of the software package. 
The project is an open source project and the source code is hosted on [github](https://github.com/hammal/cbadc).

Since its release, many additional features have been added as this have proven a very useful tool (as a golden model)
when developing lower level circuit implementations. These and future updates are mainly announced and documented in the
[documentation](https://cbadc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) webpage.

Bug reports, code contributions, and feature requests are most welcome and handled directly via the [github](https://github.com/hammal/cbadc) webpage.
