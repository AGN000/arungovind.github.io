I am particularly interested in the formation and political mobilisation of cleavages. A comparison of the lines of conflict as mobilized in the electoral and protest arenas shows the extent to which they follow similar trends and are shaped by the underlying cleavage structure.<br><br>
My research focuses on both cross-national and over time differences in cleavage formation and mobilisation.
