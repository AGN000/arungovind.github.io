One area of my research focuses on the transformative role of crises dynamics. In my current research I examine the political and civic responses to the COVID-19 crisis in Europe. The main part of this work is embedded in the <a href="https://solciv.blog/" target="_blank">SolZiv project</a>. 
<br><br>
Previously, as a member of the ERC project <a href="https://www.eui.eu/Projects/POLCON" target="_blank">POLCON – Political Conflict in Europe in the Shadow of the Great Recession</a> I studied the political responses to the 2008 Great Recession and following Eurozone crisis. I wrote my PhD dissertation in the framework of the POLCON project.
