My main line of research focuses on the dark matter content and structure in galaxies. I first became interested in dark matter as a research topic (beyond the level of 'dark matter - that sounds cool!') as a senior undergraduate when the various parametrizations (NFW, Einasto, ...) of dark matter density profiles came up in lecture. I remember wondering how we could possibly have such a detailed understanding of the distribution of something so little understood.

I picked up some more background knowledge while doing my MSc in [satellite galaxy evolution](/projects/satellites), enough that once I was accepted to the PhD programme in [Victoria](www.uvic.ca) and got round to picking a project I proposed to work on the cusp-core problem supervised by Julio Navarro. This 'problem' was at the time a statement of the fact that simulations of dark matter evolving under the influence of gravity forms clumps ('halos') that get denser towards their centres with a power law slope of about -1, while observations of some galaxies are more consistent with a central region of constant dark matter density (power law slope of 0). The original papers on the subject go back to the mid-nineties, so this was not a newly identified discrepancy. Right around the same time there were some major advances in simulations that soon culminated in the [EAGLE simulations](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stu2058) and the many associated spinoff projects, including the APOSTLE project {% cite 2016MNRAS.457.1931S %} that I was heavily involved in. Rotation curves of galaxies from the [THINGS](https://doi.org/10.1088/0004-6256/141/6/193) and especially the [LITTLE&nbsp;THINGS](https://doi.org/10.1088/0004-6256/149/6/180) 21&#8209;cm radio surveys surveys were also being published around the same time. This combination of circumstances offered an opportunity to make some new contributions on the subject.

<!-- Dwarf galaxies typically have low stellar and gas densities, low enough that even in there centres the dark matter density can be higher than the visible matter density. Since the dark matter is then the main contributor to the gravitational potential, dwarf galaxies make good targets for study since the dark matter 'signal' is high relative to the visible matter 'noise'.
