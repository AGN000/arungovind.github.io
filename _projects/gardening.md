With a home way out in Hakuba, Japan, we have a lot more space than Tokyo could
afford.  Plus, many of the neighbors are farmers or homesteaders and nearly
every store has seeds, planting equipment, and gardening supplies.  So, how
could we resist doing some amount of gardening?

## In Ground Bed

The first plot is a simple and small in ground bed.  Making this required
digging up quite a significant amount of dirty, filtering out the mass of rocks
that were mixed in with the soil, and then finally filling the plot back in
with more vibrant dirt.

Due to this being the first round, I don't have a good record of what's growing
inside of it but I'm pretty sure there's some Cosmos and Cucumber and very
likely some brocoli.

## Raised Bed

Round number two for gardening led to a different plan.  I didn't want to dig
up a bunch of dirty and clean it out so I took the much simpler route, building
a raised bed and filling it up.

This time I did significantly better accounting and know that it has a fun mix
of plants in the fall season:

*  Kale
*  Spinach
*  Bok Choi
*  Stock
*  Viola
