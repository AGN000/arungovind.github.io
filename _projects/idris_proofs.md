Implemented proofs of various (relatively) elementary mathematical results in Idris, for the Logic, Types and Spaces course at IISc.

[Link](https://github.com/siddhartha-gadgil/LTS2019/tree/master/Code) to the code on Prof. Gadgil's repository. [Link](https://github.com/siddhartha-gadgil/LTS2019/blob/master/_reports/chinmaya/chinmaya.md) to a file listing my contributions.

**Positives:** Some amazing hands on experience with interactive theorem proving. A funny sense of validation coming from a computer verifying a fact known to you to be trivial. My first experience with Git! 

**Negatives:** A lot of elementary proofs were far more tedious than expected. While we expected a reasonable gap between human and computer-assisted proofs, there were (possibly never clearly stated) ways we felt Idris could be redesigned to make life easier.

**Technical takeaways:** Programming in a dependently typed language. Mixing algorithms for establishing elementary theorems with proofs that they work is probably a good way to set one up for program verification. 

**Meta takeaways:** As my first experience working on a large computational project, I got hands-on experience with the practice of dividing up a truly huge problem into smaller ones and tackling them separately.
