Studying the different forms of interaction between the electoral and the protest arena is a topic I explore from a variety of different angles. The research lies at the intersection of the literature on party competition and social movement studies. It encompasses both a large n statistical overview and selected case studies designed to illustrate the different mechanisms of how parties and protest movements interact.
