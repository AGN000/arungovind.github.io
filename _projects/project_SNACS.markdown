As part of the [Semantic Network of Adposition and Case Supersenses (SNACS)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1018/) project, I managed annotation of prepositional meanings in English data from Summer 2019 through Summer 2020. 

While I was working on SNACS, we annotated two different corpora:
* The [PASTRIE Corpus](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.law-1.10/) of Reddit L2 English data, presented at LAW 2020. This allows us to investigate how speakers with different first languages use prepositions in English.
* The English translation of _The Little Prince_.
