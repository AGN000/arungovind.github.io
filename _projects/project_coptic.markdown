In summer 2016, I worked with Amir Zeldes to create the [Coptic Dictionary Online](https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/coptic-dictionary/). I converted the dictionary data from XML files to a searchable SQL database, wrote the search function, and created the webpages to allow search, and display result lists and individual entries. 

We published a [paper on the dictionary](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-4502/) at the SIGHUM workshop in 2018.

In 2019, the dictionary won "Best DH Tool or Suite of Tools" at the [Digital Humanities Awards](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2019/results/).
