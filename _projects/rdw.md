## Intro

Using real walking to control the playback of the 360° videos is a natural and immersive way to matches visual and self-motion perception. Redirected walking (RDW) techniques can enable users to walk in limited physical tracking space but experience larger scenes.

At this stage, we have conducted a user study about the detection thresholds (DTs) for translation and rotation gains in 360° video-based virtual environments in three scenes with different widths.[1]

Next, we will develop a systematic tool for converting 360° videos into immersive VR natural walking tours. With this tool, users will have the flexibility to select their preferred 360° videos and customize their touring experiences based on their individual interests.
