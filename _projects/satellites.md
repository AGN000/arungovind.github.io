{% include figure.html path="assets/img/satellites.png" class="img-fluid rounded" width="65%" caption="The evolution of satellite galaxies is coupled to their path through their host system. As they approach, accretion of fresh gas becomes increasingly inefficient. While tides begin to strip DM, then later gas and stars, the ram pressure of the intra-group/cluster medium ablates first coronal gas, then the ISM. Meanwhile, star formation continues to consume gas, and feed back energy via supernovae. Eventually, the gas supply is exhausted, the satellite becomes quiescent, and may ultimately be completely destroyed. (Background image: <a href='http://bf-astro.com/'>Bob Franke</a>)" %}
