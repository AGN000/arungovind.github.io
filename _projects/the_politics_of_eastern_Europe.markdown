While most of my work is comparative and concerns countries from northwestern, southern and eastern Europe, I am particularly interested in the specific issues post-communist countries face. <br><br>
This line of research explores conflict structures, the strategies of mobilising actors, as well as patterns of individual behavior. I am generally interested in the region, but some of my work has a more narrow focus on the politics of Romania and Hungary.
