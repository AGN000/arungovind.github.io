The title of my thesis was `Synchronization of quantum and classical clocks, and energy translation using resolvent functional calculus for the confined time of arrival operators` which was composed of two parts. The first half of the thesis studied the physical aspects of the confined time of arrival (CTOA) operators<d-footnote>Recently, it was realized that Pauli's theorem on the non-existence of self-adjoint time operators was flawed and did not hold within the single Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics <sup><d-cite key="galapon2002pauli,galapon2002self"></d-cite></sup>. This realization has led to the introduction of the CTOA operators, which is a class of self-adjoint time operators that are conjugate to their respective Hamiltonians on a non-dense subspace of the system Hilbert space. Moreover, the system is confined in a segment of the real line [-l,l] with non-vanishing boundary conditions $$ \phi(-l)=e^{-2i\gamma}\phi(l) $$. The conjugacy of the CTOA operators is a reflection of the conjugacy of the underlying classical time of arrival with the classical Hamiltonian. </d-footnote> by synchronizing quantum and classical clocks made of quantum particles that uses the time of arrival as time interval markers. This was done by imprinting a position-dependent phase onto the particle's initial wavefunction using an impulsive potential. The position-dependent phase is constructed in such a way that it eliminates the quantum correction terms <d-footnote>It has been shown that in the limit of large confining length, the CTOA operators predict quantum correction terms to the classical time of arrival of neutrons in a time of flight experiment <sup><d-cite key="galapon2009quantum"></d-cite></sup>.</d-footnote> up to an arbitrary order. 

The second half the thesis studied the mathematical aspect of the CTOA operators by investigating the energy translation <d-footnote>A time operator must also be a generator of energy translation since it satisfies the timeenergy canonical commutation relation.</d-footnote> properties of the CTOA operators using resolvent functional calculus. The resolvent operators were solved explicitly and it was shown that the poles of the resolvent operators coincide with the eigenvalues of the confined time of arrival operators. An expression for the transition amplitude was also obtained and it was shown numerically that the confined time of arrival operators are not generators of energy translation.  

I was able to publish a paper on [Physical Review A](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.94.032123) and three conference proceedings from this thesis. Moreover, I was awarded the [BPI-DOST Science Award 2017](https://www.up.edu.ph/up-diliman-students-acclaimed-in-bpi-dost-science-awards-2017/) and Leticia Shahani Award for Best Undergraduate Thesis in Physics.

<!-- It has been the consensus that there exists no self-adjoint time operator for generally semibounded Hamiltonian of quantum systems due to Pauliâ€™s theorem <sup><d-cite key="pauli"></d-cite></sup>. This negative conclusion has also been shared by Allcock in his trilogy of papers on the time of arrival, i.e. one cannot find a time of arrival distribution for the free particle <sup><d-cite key="allcock1969timea"></d-cite><d-cite key="allcock1969timeb"></d-cite><d-cite key="allcock1969timec"></d-cite></sup>. The pessimistic conclusion of Pauli on the existence of a time operator has lead succeeding researchers to construct time  operators with a compromise - either give up self-adjointness or conjugacy to the Hamiltonian but not both .  -->

<!-- Construction of time operators that are self-adjoint but not conjugate to the Hamiltonian has been advocated in Refs. <d-cite key="delgado1997arrival"></d-cite> and <d-cite key="grot1996time"></d-cite>. However, in recent years, it has been the consensus that time operators are necessarily conjugate to the system Hamiltonian but are positive operator valued measurements (POVM) that transform covariantly under time translations <sup><d-cite key="srinivas1981time,busch1990energy,busch1997operational,egusquiza1999free,toller1999localization,busch1995afraid,giannitrapani1997positive,busch1994time,atmanspacher1998positive"></d-cite></sup>. By treating time as a POVM-observable this implies that the postulates of standard quantum mechanics must be modified. The closest, however, to an ideal classical arrival-time distribution for a free quantum particle using the standard quantum formalism extended with the POVM theory was proposed by Kijowski <sup><d-cite key="kijowski1974time"></d-cite></sup>.  -->
