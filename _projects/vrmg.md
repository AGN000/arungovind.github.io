## Intro

Metafictional game is a unique genre that offers a self-reflective gaming experience by breaking the fourth wall between the game and players. This encourages unconventional and thought-provoking engagement with the medium. Virtual Reality (VR) is perfectly suited for this kind of gameplay, given its ability to merge virtual and real worlds and enhance the narrative essence of metafictional game.

However, most metafictional games are still focused on non-VR platforms. To address this gap, the project aims to explore the integration of VR and metafictional game and reveal the player experience within VR metafictional games.

<h2>VR Game Prototype</h2>

**1. Game Story** 📜

The game story is inspired by John Campbell's *The Hero's Journey*.

This game includes three scenes. In a medieval style game world with a "sword and magic" theme, the Player role plays as the Protagonist, who is called to an adventure and guided by the Mentor. (Fig. 1 Journey's Beginning)

Leaving the village to vanquish the Evil, the Protagonist embarks on a solitary journey through the Dangerous Wild, where he/she hones the skill of using multiple weapons. (Fig. 2 Dangerous Wild)

At the castle of Evil, the Protagonist duels with the Boss and saves the world finally. (Fig. 3 Last Duel)

⚔️In the last scene, Boss will "read" the mind of the Protagonist/Player, making itself undefeatable. By implementing the metafictional gameplay(details in next section), the Protagonist and the Player will be divided. The Protagonist directly talks to the Player and asks the Player to save the virtual world from the real world. 

> *The Protagonist or the Player, who is the Hero?*

During the course of a VR game, players undergo stages akin to Campbell's depiction of the hero's journey, transitioning from the real world into the virtual world and then back to reality. Meanwhile, the metafictional gameplay creates a personalized and realistic adventure for players, allowing them to become heroes within the fusion of the virtual and real worlds.

## User Study & Player Experience

Qualitative (thematic analysis) and quantitative (questionnaires like SUS and GEQ) methods have been used to investigate the player experience. 

Preliminary results indicate that VR Metafictional Game has the potential to enhance players' sensory and imaginative immersion. By breaking the fourth wall within the VR environment, it prompts players to reflect upon the relationship between reality and the virtual world.
