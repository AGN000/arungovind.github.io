###Intro

Metafictional game is a unique genre that offers a self-reflective gaming experience by breaking the fourth wall between the game and players. This encourages unconventional and thought-provoking engagement with the medium. Virtual Reality (VR) is perfectly suited for this kind of gameplay, given its ability to merge virtual and real worlds and enhance the narrative essence of metafictional game.

However, most metafictional games are still focused on non-VR platforms. To address this gap, the project aims to explore the integration of VR and metafictional game and reveal the player experience within VR metafictional games.
