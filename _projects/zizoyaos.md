- Developed a bootloader that reads disk sectors, switches the operating system into 32-bit protected mode, loads the kernel, and initializes the GDT using NASM Assembly.
- Implemented a kernel using C, which has the following functionalities and components: IDT, ISR, IRQ initialization, ports communication, CPU interrupts handler for capturing, processing and giving feedback,
display driver, keyboard driver(allows key combinations).
- Designed a command-line interface and some functionalities, which include a calculator allowing simple
operations.
