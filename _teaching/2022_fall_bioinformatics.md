I gave two Guest Lectures for this class. The first lecture focused on how sequencing data is generated, and how to preprocess raw reads from a sequencer into a gene counts matrix.

The second lecture focused on what to do with a counts matrix. The standard steps for analyzing the data include filtering and normalization, visualization, differential expression analysis, and modeling.

I also made two practice Google Colab notebooks for the second lecture. The <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11WUQeR6Kv9ORbKhGNhWCVZ2MmAHNKoVZ?usp=sharing">first notebook</a> is a general introduction to working with large datasets. The <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pZmwxpIL1y3O0Ck2i1uSYqoNKxP8wvzI?usp=sharing">second notebook</a> uses DESeq2 to run a differential expression analysis on sequencing data.
