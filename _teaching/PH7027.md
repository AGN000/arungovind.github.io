### Overview

This course is an introduction to plasma physics applied to magnetic fusion energy. It will present key nuclear reactions, and the advantages/drawbacks of fusion energy. The course will explain why confining a hot plasma is the best way to produce fusion energy, and how this can be done with intense magnetic fields. In addition, it will introduce the main instabilities that may plague a plasma. Instabilities appear as a potential threat that requires appropriate means of control. Small- scale instabilities lead to a turbulent state that may degrade the confinement properties of a fusion device if not taken care of. Finally, the course will present ways to heat a plasma to reach the conditions needed to start fusion reactions. The course is open to any graduate or under-graduate student with some background in statistical mechanics and electromagnetism. It will also establish connections with other topics such as plasma propulsion, plasma processing, astrophysics and wave propagation in complex media.
