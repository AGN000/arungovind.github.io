The tension between security and convenience, when creating passwords, is well established. It is a tension that often leads users to create poor passwords. For security designers, three mitigation strategies exist: issuing passwords, mandating minimum strength levels or encouraging better passwords. The first strategy prompts recording, the second reuse, but the third merits further investigation. It seemed promising to explore whether users could be subtly nudged towards stronger passwords.

Aim. The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of visual nudges on self-chosen password length and/or strength.

Method. A university application, enabling students to check course dates and review grades, was used to support two consecutive empirical studies over the course of two academic years. In total, 497 and 776 participants, respectively, were randomly assigned either to a control or an experimental group. Whereas the control group received no intervention, the experimental groups were presented with different visual nudges on the registration page of the web application whenever passwords were created. The experimental groups? password strengths and lengths were then compared that of the control group.

Results. No impact of the visual nudges could be detected, neither in terms of password strength nor length. The ordinal score metric used to calculate password strength led to a decrease in variance and test power, so that the inability to detect an effect size does not definitively indicate that such an effect does not exist.

Conclusion. We cannot conclude that the nudges had no effect on password strength. It might well be that an actual effect was not detected due to the experimental design choices. Another possible explanation for our result is that password choice is influenced by the user?s task, cognitive budget, goals and pre-existing routines. A simple visual nudge might not have the power to overcome these forces. Our lessons learned therefore recommend the use of a richer password strength quantification measure, and the acknowledgement of the user?s context, in future studies.}}

The reconfigurable spaces with particular focus on technology, empower students in participative learning. The opportunity for students is to use their own, familiar and friendly devices to create and share content with peers. They do not need to learn a new tool and instead can focus on the task at hand. The challenge for educators is to recognise that such devices are not just generic pieces of plastic, but rather, highly personal devices. They are more than just a familiar tool. Smartphones share more similarities with a personal diary than a traditional desktop, they are pocket computers that contain countless conversations, notes and photographs.

The concern is that students may share more than they would like with the rest of the class. Smartphone sharing in an active learning space is little more than pushing pixels from a single small screen to several larger ones. It is an all or nothing experience. The potential result is that a student?s shared creation could be interrupted with a message from mum, balance notification from their bank or an invite to play a game. The brief experience not only serves to embarrass the student, but dissuade others from sharing in class.

Practically preserving the privacy of computing science students in active spaces has prompted my own thoughts on the challenges of sharing. These problems will be faced by students in varied domains as such spaces become prevalent. However, the solution should not been seen through a technical lens, but rather as an opportunity to reconsider the requirements of sharing and what it actually means in active learning spaces. The talk will consider solutions to preserving privacy as well as privacy challenges of in higher education before attempting to reconceptualising sharing for active learning. The aspiration is that reconsidering sharing might not only spare the blushes of students it could also produce stronger outcomes from active spaces.}}

TEAL spaces support students in projecting presentations (e.g. from smart-phones) and sharing notes (e.g. from smart-watches) with peers. Importantly, this sharing is partly amongst their co-present small group but sometimes to the whole class. However, plugging personal things into smart spaces whose first requirement is to accept as many devices as possible is not without consequence. A projected notification of a political conversation, for example, has the potential to harm the individual both within the space and beyond, opening them to unwanted judgment, criticism and assessment.

The traditional argument from the usable security community is that of intervention prior to any use whatever: users need to be trained, taught and/or nudged to avoid such problems. We conducted an informal focus group with students in a pilot TEAL space, exploring issues around the privacy and security of using personal devices in such spaces. The reality is that it is hard to perceive the privacy and security challenges prior to using the space. We argue that such prior interventions are not only a significant barrier to student adoption of smart spaces, but ineffective in ensuring the safety of individuals in the long-term.

We argue that in designing smart spaces, both on-campus and off, designers need to adopt an approach of individually evolved privacy requirements to ensure an on-going safe, creative space for students. Two important features are: (a) as a small group develops bonds, its privacy level needs to be reduced over time and (b) the best privacy level depends on the whether the screen is currently shared with the small group or the large class.}, doi= {10.1145/3137003.3137009}}

channels involved in the process to be trustworthy; otherwise
authentication secrets can easily be compromised. Given the
unceasing efforts of attackers worldwide such trustworthiness
is increasingly not a given. A variety of technical solutions,
such as utilising multiple devices/channels and verification
protocols, has the potential to mitigate the threat of untrusted
communications to a certain extent. Yet such technical solutions
make two assumptions: (1) users have access to multiple
devices and (2) attackers will not resort to hacking the human,
using social engineering techniques. In this paper, we propose
and explore the potential of using human-based computation
instead of solely technical solutions to mitigate the threat of
untrusted devices and channels. ZeTA (Zero Trust Authentication
on untrusted channels) has the potential to allow people to
authenticate despite compromised channels or communications
and easily observed usage. Our contributions are threefold:
(1) We propose the ZeTA protocol with a formal definition
and security analysis that utilises semantics and human-based
computation to ameliorate the problem of untrusted devices
and channels. (2) We outline a security analysis to assess
the envisaged performance of the proposed authentication
protocol. (3) We report on a usability study that explores the
viability of relying on human computation in this context.}, doi= {10.1109/EuroSP.2016.35}}

Initial deployment did not reveal the problems of passwords, deep and profound flaws only emerged once passwords were deployed in the wild. The need for a replacement is widely acknowledged yet despite over a decade of research into knowledge-based alternatives, few, if any, have been adopted by industry. Alternatives are unconvincing for three primary reasons. The first is that alternatives are rarely investigated beyond the initial proposal, with only the results from a constrained lab test provided to convince adopters of their viability. The second is that alternatives are seldom tested realistically where the authenticator mediates access to something of value. The third is that the testing rarely varies the device or context beyond that initially targeted. In the modern world different devices are used across a variety of contexts. What works well in one context may easily fail in another. Consequently, the contribution of this paper is an "in the wild" evaluation of an alternative authentication mechanism that had demonstrated promise in its lab evaluation. In the field test the mechanism was deployed to actual users to regulate access to an application in a context beyond that initially proposed. The performance of the mechanism is reported and discussed. We conclude by reflecting on the value of field evaluations of alternative authentication mechanisms.}, doi= {10.1109/STAST.2015.13}}

In the virtual world this is generally replaced by self declaration. Some service providers resort to using heavy-weight identification mechanisms, judging adulthood as a side effect thereof. Collection of identification data arguably constitutes an unwarranted privacy invasion in this context, if carried out merely to perform adulthood estimation. This paper presents a mechanism that exploits the adult's more extensive exposure to public media, relying on the likelihood that they will be able to recall details if cued by a carefully chosen picture. We conducted an online study to gauge the viability of this scheme. With our prototype we were able to predict that the user was a child 99\% of the time. Unfortunately the scheme also misclassified too many adults. We discuss our results and suggest directions for future research.}, doi= {10.1145/2702123.2702456}}

These skills develop over a long period of time and are much rarer. Here we consider whether we can exploit this reality in the security arena, specifically to achieve a stronger form of authentication. Authentication has traditionally been performed based on what users know, hold or are. The first is the most popular, in the form of the password. This is often referred to as ?knowledge-based? authentication. Yet, rigorously following guidelines for password creation produces forgettable gibberish and nonsense strings, not knowledge. Nonsense is hard to remember and users engage in a number of coping strategies to ameliorate this, and these tend to weaken the authenticator. It would be beneficial to find a way of reducing this memorial load, to identify a more usable mechanism. This is hard: usually reducing the memorial load also makes the secret easier to guess. The challenge is in finding a way to reduce memory load while holding the line as far as strength is concerned. Here we contemplate exploiting recognition of artefacts resulting from experts practicing their craft: ?skill-based? authentication. This should reduce the memorial load and effort, but also, crucially, make it harder for a random intruder to replicate. We report on how we trialled SNIPPET, a prototype of an authentication mechanism that relied on an expert programmer identifying his/her own code snippets from successive challenge sets. We found that our participants were all able to identify their own code snippets and that other participants were unable to guess these, even when they observed the legitimate person authenticating beforehand. These findings are not conclusive given the small number of participants but they do show promise and suggest that this is an area worth pursuing. We conclude by returning to the three NIST-identified forms of authentication and consider how SNIPPET can be positioned within the general authentication arena.}}

Thus, one could argue that the textual password needs to be replaced. One alternative is graphical authentication. A wide range of graphical mechanisms have been proposed in the research literature. Yet, the industry has not embraced these alternatives. We use nowadays (textual) passwords several times a day to mediate access to protected resources and to ensure that accountability is facilitated. Consequently, the main aspect of interest to decision-makers is the strength of an authentication mechanism to resist intrusion attempts. Yet, researchers proposing alternative mechanisms have primarily focused on the users' need for superior usability while the strength of the mechanisms often remains unknown to the decision makers. In this paper we describe a range of graphical authentication mechanisms and consider how much strength they exhibit, in comparison to the textual password. As basic criteria for this comparison, we use the standard guessability, observability and recordability metrics proposed by De Angeli et al. in 2005. The intention of this paper is to provide a better understanding of the potential for graphical mechanisms to be equal to, or superior to, the password in terms of meeting its most basic requirement namely resisting intrusion attempts.}}

Authentication, for the deployer, regulates access and enforces accountability. Authentication, for the user, obstructs, intrudes and delays gratification. Whereas users could probably put up with this if it happens relatively infrequently, this tends not to be the case. An authentication prompt is presented a number of times during the day. Sometimes it has serious consequences, such as when it is required to authorise the purchase of a digital item, and the permits consequent credit card charge. Other times it merely identifies the user to allow the system to customise the interface. The range of consequences and the multiplicity of systems mandating shared secrets collide with human limitations and the current password bloat and general end-user exasperation.

Is it at all possible to improve authentication? As researchers, we have primarily addressed this problem in one of three ways: (1) by trying to find a password replacement, (2) by formulating rules and regulations to coerce users into choosing stronger passwords, or (3) fostering a security culture within the organisation, hoping that the social pressure will induce people to behave more securely. These endeavours have met with limited success. Alternatives have not been embraced by the developer community, rules and regulations are often ignored, subverted or deliberately flouted. Fostering a security culture has had more success, in relative terms, but still has not really addressed the ?authentication problem?. The one thing these approaches have in common is their focus on the human agent: the end user.

Consider a related problem in the physical world: locks on doors. These have not changed in centuries and the doors themselves are probably weaker than they were a hundred years ago. Yet do locks really prevent intrusion? A determined intruder finds the average lock an minor deterrent, and the door itself is sometimes even made of glass, allowing the thief to subvert the lock entirely. Yet one never hears about a desperate search for a door or lock replacement. One doesn?t hear the refrain, ?How do you solve a problem like the door lock? This even though they, too, are lost, copied and shared. Why, when it comes to virtual locks, is there such a drive to come up with the perfect locking mechanism? The password and the average door lock function similarly: neither is perfect but both provide an acceptable measure of security. Here we will argue that it might be time to suspend our unrealistic expectations that we can find a perfect lock in the virtual world when we live quite happily with imperfect security in the physical world.}}

Renaud and J. Maguire}, year= {2013}, pages= {2--11}, url= {http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/102864/}, abstract= {Developers create paths for users to tread. Some users will stay on the beaten track; others will diverge and take risky shortcuts. If user-preferred and developer-created paths diverge too much, it is time for the developer to consider a new path. A case in point is the humble password. They fill an important developer need: a cheap and easy mechanism to control access and enforce accountability. Unfortunately, users find the constant requests for authentication a nuisance. They respond by walking down risky paths that compromise the mechanism but allow them to satisfy goals more quickly. The answer, for some researchers, has been to come up with password alternatives. This focus is misguided, since the alternatives do nothing to reduce the authentication footprint. The reality is that developers overuse authentication. The problem is not the authentication step, but rather its position in the path. Authentication is sometimes used even when there is no real need for it. This creates confusion in the user?s mind about the consequences of authentication: sometimes it authorises significant side effects and other times it is difficult to identify its raison d?etre. Here we suggest some developer patterns which minimise authentication requests, emphasising necessity rather than gratuitousness. We believe this will help to ease the current situation by moving towards genuine risk mitigation rather than harming authentication by excessive use thereof.}}

However, it is clearly inadequate in a world where increasing numbers of systems and services require people to authenticate in a shared space, while being actively observed. This new reality places pressure on a password mechanism never intended for use in such a context. Asterisks may obfuscate alphanumeric characters on entry but popular systems, e.g. Apple iPhone and Nintendo Wii, regularly require users to use an on-screen keyboard for character input. This may not be a real concern within the context of secluded space but inadvertly reveals a secret within shared space. Such a secret has an economic cost in terms of replacement, recall and revenue, all of which affect the financial return of the offending systems and services.{\ensuremath{<}}/p{\ensuremath{>}}

Where it has been done, it has mainly been for students where the technology itself was also relevant to their studies (e.g. computing science or media studies courses). Here however we report on one of these on a course for ?non-technical? students from the faculty of Arts. These students were required to produce a single video podcast for their third-year philosophy course. The requirements to present something useful to fellow students and to master a new and fashionable technology are well designed to augment self-confidence and self-efficacy, to engage students, to equip them with a skill that may enhance their employability, and to foster deeper learning. However a basic reason for student generated content of this kind is that authoring for other students (rather than for marking by a staff member) should give impetus to deeper thought about the content. This would not only cement existing knowledge but also supplement it with new perspectives and considerations. Sceptics might argue differently, claiming it to be a gimmick to boost course numbers. However, crafting a report, essay or regurgitating facts on exam day involve different learning experiences and skills to that of giving a persuasive presentation to a large audience.}}

The acceptability for each stakeholder group separately is discussed: learners, teachers, IT support. The technology's characteristics are assessed with respect to essential factors for widespread adoption: cost, ease of use (i.e. personal effort and learning costs for users), and educational benefit. The underlying technologies are briefly described, partly to indicate what the fundamental advantages are based on (independently of currently available products) and partly to allow likely longevity to be assessed. Finally some underlying principles from the viewpoint of educational research are proposed and discussed.}}
