  abstract = {Accurate mapping of greenhouse gas fluxes at the Earth's surface is essential for the validation and calibration of climate models. In this study, we present a framework for surface flux estimation with drones. Our approach uses data assimilation (DA) to infer fluxes from drone-based observations, and reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the drone's sampling strategy. Herein, we demonstrate that an RL-trained drone can quantify a CO2 hotspot more accurately than a drone sampling along a predefined flight path thattraverses the emission plume. We find that information-based reward functions can match the performance of an error-based reward function that quantifies the difference between the estimated surface flux and the true value. Reward functions based on information gain and information entropy can motivate actions that increase the drone's confidence in its~updated belief, without requiring knowledge of the true surface flux. These findings provide valuable insights for further development of the framework for the mapping of more complex surface flux fields.},

  abstract = {A mosaic approach to represent subgrid snow variation in a coupled atmosphere{\textendash}land surface model (WRF{\textendash}Noah) is introduced and tested. Solid precipitation is scaled in 10 subgrid tiles based on precalculated snow distributions, giving a consistent, explicit representation of variable snow cover and snow depth on subgrid scales. The method is tested in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model for southern Norway at 3-km grid spacing, using the subgrid tiling for areas above the tree line. At a validation site in Finse, the modeled transition time from full snow cover to snow-free ground is increased from a few days with the default snow cover fraction formulation to more than 2 months with the tiling approach, which agrees with in situ observations from both digital camera images and surface temperature loggers. This in turn reduces a cold bias at this site by more than 28C during the first half of July, with the noontime bias reduced from 258 to 218C. The improved representation of subgrid snow variation also reduces a cold bias found in the reference simulation on regional scales by up to 0.88C and increases surface energy fluxes (in particular the latent heat flux), and it resulted in up to 50\% increase in monthly (June) precipitation in some of the most affected areas. By simulating individual soil properties for each tile, this approach also accounts for a number of secondary effects of uneven snow distribution resulting in different energy and moisture fluxes in different tiles also after the snow has disappeared.},

  abstract = {Place-based data is required in wildfire analyses, particularly in regions of diverse terrain that foster not only strong gradients in meteorological variables, but also complex fire behaviour. However, a majority of downscaling methods are inappropriate for wildfire application due to the lack of daily timescales and variables such as humidity and winds that are important for fuel flammability and fire spread. Two statistical downscaling methods, the daily Bias corrected Spatial Downscaling (BCSD) and the Multivariate Adapted Constructed Analogs (MACA) that directly incorporate daily data from global climate models, were validated over the western US using global reanalysis data. While both methods outperformed results obtained from direct interpolation from reanalysis, MACA exhibited additional skill in temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation due to its ability to jointly downscale temperature and dew point temperature, and its use of analog patterns rather than interpolation. Both downscaling methods exhibited value added information in tracking fire danger indices and periods of extreme fire danger; however, MACA outperformed the daily BCSD due to its ability to more accurately capture relative humidity and winds.

  abstract = {In 2018 we celebrated 25\,years of development of radar altimetry, and the progress achieved by this methodology in the fields of global and coastal oceanography, hydrology, geodesy and cryospheric sciences. Many symbolic major events have celebrated these developments, e.g., in Venice, Italy, the 15th (2006) and 20th (2012) years of progress and more recently, in 2018, in Ponta Delgada, Portugal, 25 Years of Progress in Radar Altimetry. On this latter occasion it was decided to collect contributions of scientists, engineers and managers involved in the worldwide altimetry community to depict the state of altimetry and propose recommendations for the altimetry of the future. This paper summarizes contributions and recommendations that were collected and provides guidance for future mission design, research activities, and sustainable operational radar altimetry data exploitation. Recommendations provided are fundamental for optimizing further scientific and operational advances of oceanographic observations by altimetry, including requirements for spatial and temporal resolution of altimetric measurements, their accuracy and continuity. There are also new challenges and new openings mentioned in the paper that are particularly crucial for observations at higher latitudes, for coastal oceanography, for cryospheric studies and for hydrology. The paper starts with a general introduction followed by a section on Earth System Science including Ocean Dynamics, Sea Level, the Coastal Ocean, Hydrology, the Cryosphere and Polar Oceans and the ``Green'' Ocean, extending the frontier from biogeochemistry to marine ecology. Applications are described in a subsequent section, which covers Operational Oceanography, Weather, Hurricane Wave and Wind Forecasting, Climate projection. Instruments' development and satellite missions' evolutions are described in a fourth section. A fifth section covers the key observations that altimeters provide and their potential complements, from other Earth observation measurements to in situ data. Section 6 identifies the data and methods and provides some accuracy and resolution requirements for the wet tropospheric correction, the orbit and other geodetic requirements, the Mean Sea Surface, Geoid and Mean Dynamic Topography, Calibration and Validation, data accuracy, data access and handling (including the DUACS system). Section 7 brings a transversal view on scales, integration, artificial intelligence, and capacity building (education and training). Section 8 reviews the programmatic issues followed by a conclusion.},

  abstract = {The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) is a 14-channel imaging instrument operating on NASA's Terra satellite since 1999. ASTER's visible{\textendash}near infrared (VNIR) instrument, with three bands and a 15 m Instantaneous field of view (IFOV), is accompanied by an additional band using a second, backward-looking telescope. Collecting along-track stereo pairs, the geometry produces a base-to-height ratio of 0.6. In August 2019, the ASTER Science Team released Version 3 of the global DEM (GDEM) based on stereo correlation of 1.8 million ASTER scenes. The DEM has 1 arc-second latitude and longitude postings ({\textasciitilde}30 m) and employed cloud masking to avoid cloud-contaminated pixels. Custom software was developed to reduce or eliminate artifacts found in earlier GDEM versions, and to fill holes due to the masking. Each 1{\texttimes}1 degree GDEM tile was manually inspected to verify the completeness of the anomaly removal, which was generally excellent except across some large ice sheets. The GDEM covers all of the Earth's land surface from 83 degrees north to 83 degrees south latitude. This is a unique, global high spatial resolution digital elevation dataset available to all users at no cost. In addition, a second unique dataset was produced and released. The raster-based ASTER Global Water Body Dataset (ASTWBD) identifies the presence of permanent water bodies, and marks them as ocean, lake, or river. An accompanying DEM file indicates the elevation for each water pixel. To date, over 100 million 1{\texttimes}1 degree GDEM tiles have been distributed.},

Generative approaches are appealing in this situation, as a model of the data's probability density can assist in identifying clusters. Nonparametric Bayesian methods, while ideal in theory due to their principled motivations, have been difficult to apply to SSL in practice. We present a nonparametric Bayesian method that uses Gaussian processes for the generative model, avoiding many of the problems associated with Dirichlet process mixture models. Our model is fully generative and we take advantage of recent advances in Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to provide a practical inference method. Our method compares favorably to competing approaches on synthetic and real-world multi-class data.},

  abstract = {The lack of seismic low frequencies in towed-streamer data is known to have an outsized detrimental effect on advanced velocity model building techniques such as full-waveform inversion (FWI). Since seabed acquisition records ultralow frequencies (1{\textendash}4 Hz) with high signal-to-noise ratio, this presents an opportunity to learn, in a supervised machine learning fashion, a bandwidth extension function to enrich towed-streamer data with low frequencies. We use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel method for learning low-frequency reconstruction from an ultrasparse set of ocean-bottom nodes (OBNs). This bandwidth extension is tested on two large field data sets (from an OBN survey and a wide-azimuth towed-steamer survey) acquired over a complex-shaped salt region in the Gulf of Mexico. The reconstructed low frequencies, although not perfect, enable FWI to more effectively correct the shape of salt bodies and result in improved subsalt imaging. Well-tie analysis shows an improvement in phase stability around the wellbore and a fit to within half a cycle at reservoir level. This work links together towed-streamer and seabed acquisitions, providing a costeffective solution to help offshore seismic exploration with higher-quality low frequencies.},

To facilitate regional impact assessments, this study statistically downscales (to 1/8{$^\circ$} spatial resolution) and corrects the bias of daily maximum and minimum temperature and daily precipitation data from six GCMs and four Regional Climate Models (RCMs) for the northeast United States (US) using the Statistical Downscaling and Bias Correction (SDBC) approach. Based on these downscaled data from multiple models, five extreme indices were analyzed for the future climate to quantify future changes of climate extremes. For a subset of models and indices, results based on raw and bias corrected model outputs for the present-day climate were compared with observations, which demonstrated that bias correction is important not only for GCM outputs, but also for RCM outputs. For future climate, bias correction led to a higher level of agreements among the models in predicting the magnitude and capturing the spatial pattern of the extreme climate indices. We found that the incorporation of dynamical downscaling as an intermediate step does not lead to considerable differences in the results of statistical downscaling for the study domain.},

  abstract = {The term ``simultaneous source'' refers to the idea of firing several seismic sources so that their combined energy is recorded into the same set of receivers during a single conventional shotpoint timing cycle. The idea is to collect the equivalent of two or more shots worth of data in the same time as it takes to collect one. The potential advantages include cost or time savings in field acquisition, which is of renewed interest due to the popularity and expense of WATS data. We were motivated to the work presented here by observations made on a 3D dataset acquired over the Petronius field in the Gulf of Mexico with two source vessels. The second source was fired with a random delay compared to the first, so that the energy from secondary source is similar to asynchronous noise. While the random nature of the crosstalk in combination with the two known geometries had been enough to successfully apply relatively standard processing techniques for other studied datasets, we found that this one required an improvement on those techniques. This paper describes a high-resolution (sparse) Radonbased separation technique with that aim. We find that while the technique does not by itself do all the required separation, it sufficiently separates the data to allow subsequent standard noise attenuation techniques to complete the task.},

  abstract = {Climate change may cause severe hydrological droughts, leading to water shortages which will require to be assessed using high-resolution data. Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite Terrestrial Water Storage (TWSA) estimates offer a promising solution to monitor hydrological drought, but its coarse resolution (1{$^\circ$}) limits its applications to small regions of the Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS). Here we employed machine learning models such as Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to downscale GRACE TWSA from 1{$^\circ$} to 0.25{$^\circ$}. The findings revealed that the XGBoost model outperformed the ANN model with Nash Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE) (0.99), Pearson correlation (R) (0.99), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (5.22 mm), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) (2.75 mm) between the predicted and GRACE-derived TWSA. Further, Water Storage Deficit Index (WSDI) and WSD (Water Storage Deficit) were used to determine the severity and episodes of droughts, respectively. The results of WSDI exhibited a strong agreement when compared with the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at different time scales (1-, 3-, and 6-months) and self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index (sc-PDSI). Moreover, the IBIS had experienced increasing drought episodes, e.g., eight drought episodes were detected within the years 2010 and 2016 with WSDI of -1.20 and -1.28 and total WSD of -496.99 mm and -734.01 mm, respectively. The Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) model between WSDI and climatic variables indicated that potential evaporation had the largest influence on drought after precipitation. The findings of this study will be helpful for drought-related decision-making in IBIS.},

  abstract = {Within the past 125,000 years, variations in Earth's climate have resulted in global sea levels fluctuating from 130 to 140 m lower than present day to 6 to 9 m higher. Presently, global mean sea level is rising at its fastest rate in the past 6000 years (at \$3.6 mm/year for 2006{\textendash}2015) and is accelerating. In this chapter, we discuss both the causes and implications of sea-level rise from the perspective of a cryospheric hazard. We also review the best estimates of sea-level rise and cryospheric mass change from a variety of monitoring techniques. The transfer of ice into the sea has contributed almost 50\% of the sea-level rise since 1993 and exceeded the combined sea-level changes due to thermal expansion, changes in terrestrial water storage, and changes in ocean basin size since at least 2006. This cryospheric contribution to sea-level rise is split between the combined ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica and the global population of about 215,000 glaciers. Over the last decade, the contribution from ice sheets has been increasing faster than that from glaciers. The societal effects of sea-level rise will be highly varied throughout the world, with some locations experiencing a sea-level fall, while others experience a sea-level rise several times the global mean. Perhaps counterintuitively, the sea-level rise due to terrestrial ice loss will be most substantial in areas furthest from the source of melting ice. Although this cryospheric hazard will unfold over a much longer timescale than many of the other hazards discussed in this volume, the ramifications of sea-level rise will likely be more widespread and profound. Some of the most important implications discussed here include coastal inundation, increased coastal flood frequency, and groundwater salination.},

  abstract = {Accurate knowledge of the seasonal snow distribution is vital in several domains including ecology, water resources management, and tourism. Current spaceborne sensors provide a useful but incomplete description of the snowpack. Many studies suggest that the assimilation of remotely sensed products in physically based snowpack models is a promising path forward to estimate the spatial distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE). However, to date there is no standalone, open-source, community-driven project dedicated to snow data assimilation, which makes it difficult to compare existing algorithms and fragments development efforts. Here we introduce a new data assimilation toolbox, the Multiple Snow Data Assimilation System (MuSA), to help fill this gap. MuSA was developed to fuse remotely sensed information that is available at different timescales with the energy and mass balance Flexible Snow Model (FSM2). MuSA was designed to be user-friendly and scalable. It enables assimilation of different state variables such as the snow depth, SWE, snow surface temperature, binary or fractional snow-covered area, and snow albedo and could be easily upgraded to assimilate other variables such as liquid water content or snow density in the future. MuSA allows the joint assimilation of an arbitrary number of these variables, through the generation of an ensemble of FSM2 simulations. The characteristics of the ensemble (i.e., the number of particles and their prior covariance) may be controlled by the user, and it is generated by perturbing the meteorological forcing of FSM2. The observational variables may be assimilated using different algorithms including particle filters and smoothers as well as ensemble Kalman filters and smoothers along with their iterative variants. We demonstrate the wide capabilities of MuSA through two snow data assimilation experiments. First, 5 m resolution snow depth maps derived from drone surveys are assimilated in a distributed fashion in the Izas catchment (central Pyrenees). Furthermore, we conducted a joint-assimilation experiment, fusing MODIS land surface temperature and fractional snow-covered area with FSM2 in a single-cell experiment. In light of these experiments, we discuss the pros and cons of the assimilation algorithms, including their computational cost.},

  abstract = {The rates of many processes that control rock breakdown into transportable particles are dependent upon rock temperature. In particular, frost-cracking depends largely upon the time spent within a range of subzero temperatures I call the frost cracking window. I present simple analytic solutions, detailed time series of thermal data from a field site, and a numerical model of subsurface temperatures that constrain the expected depth dependence of frost cracking. Analytic solutions using sinusoidal surface temperature histories result in predicted vertical profiles of frost-cracking intensity that depend upon the location of the frost-cracking window within the range of surface temperatures. In some cases, the expected frost cracking intensity decreases monotonically with depth, while in others it displays a distinct maximum at depth. I use hourly temperatures measured over the l-yr interval April 1995 through March 1996, at 8 depths up to 42 em into a granitic bedrock surface in the Laramie Range, Wyoming, to constrain an in situ thermal diffusivity of 1.7 mm? s - I. These temperature histories suggest that frost cracking at this site should decrease monotonically with depth into the rock. I also use this time series of temperatures to calibrate a numerical thermal model in which the top boundary condition is set by a surface radiation balance. The data require both a low albedo of the rock surface (0.1), and a high atmospheric transmissivity (0.9). I then explore the expected near-surface temperatures at other sites by running the model with different annual mean temperatures, latitudes, and slopes. The resulting simulations suggest that at lower mean annual temperatures, as are found in higher latitude and altitude sites, the frost cracking maximum should both amplify and deepen into the subsurface.},

  abstract = {Topographic surveys inevitably contain error, introducing uncertainty into estimates of volumetric or mean change based on the differencing of repeated surveys. In the geomorphic community, uncertainty has often been framed as a problem of separating out real change from apparent change due purely to error, and addressed by removing measured change considered indistinguishable from random noise from analyses (thresholding). Thresholding is important when quantifying gross changes (i.e. total erosion or total deposition), which are systematically biased by random errors in stable parts of a landscape. However, net change estimates are not substantially influenced by those same random errors, and the use of thresholds results in inherently biased, and potentially misleading, estimates of net change and uncertainty. More generally, thresholding is unrelated to the important process of propagating uncertainty in order to place uncertainty bounds around final estimates. Error propagation methods for uncorrelated, correlated, and systematic errors are presented. Those equations demonstrate that uncertainties in modern net change analyses, as well as in gross change analyses using reasonable thresholds, are likely to be dominated by low-magnitude but highly correlated or systematic errors, even after careful attempts to reduce those errors. In contrast, random errors with little to no correlation largely cancel to negligible levels when averaged or summed. Propagated uncertainty is then typically insensitive to the precision of individual measurements, and is instead defined by the relative mean error (accuracy) over the area of interest. Given that real-world mean elevation changes in many landscape settings are often similar in magnitude to potential mean errors in repeat topographic analyses, reducing highly correlated or systematic errors will be central to obtaining accurate change estimates, while placing uncertainty bounds around those results provides essential context for their interpretation.

  abstract = {In this article we craft process-specific algorithms that capture climate control of hillslope evolution in order to elucidate the legacy of past climate on present critical zone architecture and topography. Models of hillslope evolution traditionally comprise rock detachment into the mobile layer, mobile regolith transport, and a channel incision or aggradation boundary condition. We extend this system into the deep critical zone by considering a weathering damage zone below the mobile regolith in which rock strength is diminished; the degree of damage conditions the rate of mobile regolith production. We first discuss generic damage profiles in which appropriate length and damage scales govern profile shapes, and examine their dependence upon exhumation rate. We then introduce climate control through the example of rock damage by frost-generated crack growth. We augment existing frost cracking models by incorporating damage rate limitations for long transport distances for water to the freezing front. Finally we link the frost cracking damage model, a mobile regolith production rule in which rock entrainment is conditioned by the damage state of the rock, and a frost creep transport model, to examine the evolution of an interfluve under oscillating climate. Aspect-related differences in mean annual surface temperatures result in differences in bedrock damage rate and mobile regolith transport efficiency, which in turn lead to asymmetries in critical zone architecture and hillslope form (divide migration). In a quasi-steady state hillslope, the lowering rate is uniform, and the damage profile is better developed on north-facing slopes where the frost damage process is most intense. Because the residence times of mobile regolith and weathered bedrock in such landscapes are on the order of 10 to 100 ka, climate cycles over similar timescales result in modulation of transport and damage efficiencies. These lead to temporal variation in mobile regolith thickness, and to corresponding changes in sediment delivery to bounding streams. Copyright {\copyright} 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

An understanding of these properties is therefore also key to evaluating associated cryospheric hazards. The material properties of snow, ice, and permafrost vary over many orders of magnitude. Generally, ice has the smallest range in physical and thermal properties (e.g., density or thermal conductivity), while properties of snow and frozen ground have much larger variations. The frozen ground has the largest absolute range in thermal properties (e.g., thermal conductivity: 0.1{\textendash}4.0 W/m/K), and snow has the largest relative range in physical properties (e.g., thermal conductivity: 0.04{\textendash}1.0 W/m/K). The mechanical response of each material, including its strength response and creep behavior, also varies widely, depending on stress, temperature, and loading rate. Rapid loading or cold conditions result in brittle behavior with high peak strength and small critical strain, while slow loading or warm conditions result in ductile behavior with low peak strength and large strain. An assessment of hazards associated with snow, ice, and permafrost requires an appreciation of how the basic properties of these cryospheric materials are influenced and changed by environmental conditions.},

We test sea ice reversibility within a state-of-the-art atmosphere{\textendash}ocean global climate model by increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide until the Arctic Ocean becomes ice-free throughout the year and subsequently decreasing it until the initial ice cover returns. Evidence for irreversibility in the form of hysteresis outside the envelope of natural variability is explored for the loss of summer and winter ice in both hemispheres. We find no evidence of irreversibility or multiple ice-cover states over the full range of simulated sea ice conditions between the modern climate and that with an annually ice-free Arctic Ocean. Summer sea ice area recovers as hemispheric temperature cools along a trajectory that is indistinguishable from the trajectory of summer sea ice loss, while the recovery of winter ice area appears to be slowed due to the long response times of the ocean near the modern winter ice edge. The results are discussed in the context of previous studies that assess the plausibility of sea ice tipping points by other methods. The findings serve as evidence against the existence of threshold behavior in the summer or winter ice cover in either hemisphere.},

The ICESat-derived elevations have a mean accuracy, relative to the DGPS elevations, of -0.01 plusmn 0.18 m. ICESat-derived elevations on the Arctic coastal plain provide an excellent source for DEM control.

Marine records suggest that the amplitude of climate variability was smaller before that time, but such records are often poorly resolved. Moreover, it is not possible to infer the abundance of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from marine records. Here we report the recovery of a deep ice core from Dome C, Antarctica, that provides a climate record for the past 740,000 years. For the four most recent glacial cycles, the data agree well with the record from Vostok. The earlier period, between 740,000 and 430,000 years ago, was characterized by less pronounced warmth in interglacial periods in Antarctica, but a higher proportion of each cycle was spent in the warm mode. The transition from glacial to interglacial conditions about 430,000 years ago (Termination V) resembles the transition into the present interglacial period in terms of the magnitude of change in temperatures and greenhouse gases, but there are significant differences in the patterns of change. The interglacial stage following Termination V was exceptionally long{\textemdash}28,000 years compared to, for example, the 12,000 years recorded so far in the present interglacial period. Given the similarities between this earlier warm period and today, our results may imply that without human intervention, a climate similar to the present one would extend well into the future.},

In particular, postprocessing of mesoscale model output allows an efficient calculation of the local wind climate required for wind resource estimation at a wind turbine site. The method is divided into two parts: 1) preprocessing, in which the configurations for the mesoscale model simulations are determined, and 2) postprocessing, in which the data from the mesoscale simulations are prepared for wind energy application. Results from idealized mesoscale modeling experiments for a challenging wind farm site in northern Spain are presented to support the preprocessing method. Comparisons of modeling results with measurements from the same wind farm site are presented to support the postprocessing method. The crucial element in postprocessing is the bridging of mesoscale modeling data to microscale modeling input data, via a so-called generalization method. With this method, very high-resolution wind resource mapping can be achieved.},

  abstract = {Up until now, policy makers and energy planners tackling the challenges of climate change, and seeking approaches for climate change mitigation, have had no global wind resource dataset appropriate for their pressing needs. Use of coarse resolution reanalysis datasets has had the serious shortcoming that the wind energy resource is underestimated, as small scale variability of winds is missing. This missing variability means a large part of the wind resource is not captured. Crucially it is the windiest sites that suffer the largest wind resource errors at coarse resolution; in simple terrain one fifth of the wind resource may be missed, for complex terrain more than half of the wind resource may be missed. This project is built on a global methodology. It is the new and improved meteorological datasets and topographical datasets, in the public domain, that have made this project a possibility. The method employs large-scale global meteorological datasets (reanalysis), which are downscaled to high-resolution wind resource datasets via a so-called generalization step together with microscale modelling using the WAsP software developed at DTU Wind Energy. A new application of flow models in WAsP software allows calculation of high-resolution resource maps covering extensive areas. For the purpose of downscaling high-resolution datasets, appropriate surface elevation and roughness lengths have been derived from global surface elevation and land cover datasets. The application of geospatial information systems (GIS) and web-based tools help significantly to bring the Global Wind Atlas datasets alive to end-users; the end-users can analyse spatial and temporal distributions of wind resources in areas of interest determined by the end-user. Either by specifying ad-hoc areas or by selection of areas following administrative boundaries. Furthermore, through the IRENA Global Atlas the end-user is able to relate the wind resources to other factors, such as population centres, electrical transmission grids, terrain types, and protected land areas. The Global Wind Atlas does not provide a substitute for individual country-based wind atlases or wind resource assessment conducted commercially for wind farm developers. Those kinds of assessments require a higher precision, specific configuration for the region in question, and a more stringent validation phase. Importantly, the Global Wind Atlas data is the most appropriate wind resource dataset available for the needs of policy makers, energy planners, the Integrated Assessment Modelling (IAM) community and for Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). DTU Wind Energy has developed the methodology and carried out the work in the framework of the Clean Energy Ministerial Multilateral Working Group on Solar and Wind Technologies supported by the Danish Energy Agency. The DTU Wind Energy contribution has been made stronger by this international collaboration, because leading international institutions have shared valuable knowledge and liaised on the data specifications, applications, and dissemination of the data to a large and broad range of end-users.},

  abstract = {Purpose of Review The era of robotics-based environmental monitoring has given rise to many interesting areas of research. A key challenge is that robotic platforms and their operations are typically constrained in ways that limit their energy, time, or travel distance, which in turn limits the number of measurements that can be collected. Therefore, paths need to be planned to maximize the information gathered about an unknown environment while satisfying the given budget constraint, which is known as the informative planning problem. This review discusses the literature dedicated to information-driven path planning, introducing the key algorithmic building blocks as well as the outstanding challenges. Recent Findings Machine learning approaches have been introduced to solve the information-driven path planning problem, improving both efficiency and robustness. Summary This review started with the fundamental building blocks of informative planning for environment modeling and monitoring, followed by integration with machine learning, emphasizing how machine learning can be used to improve the robustness and efficiency of informative path planning in robotics.},

  abstract = {Deep learning techniques (in particular convolutional neural networks, CNNs) have recently emerged as a promising approach for statistical downscaling due to their ability to learn spatial features from huge spatiotemporal datasets. However, existing studies are based on complex models, applied to particular case studies and using simple validation frameworks, which makes a proper assessment of the (possible) added value offered by these techniques difficult. As a result, these models are usually seen as black boxes, generating distrust among the climate community, particularly in climate change applications.  In this paper we undertake a comprehensive assessment of deep learning techniques for continental-scale statistical downscaling, building on the VALUE validation framework. In particular, different CNN models of increasing complexity are applied to downscale temperature and precipitation over Europe, comparing them with a few standard benchmark methods from VALUE (linear and generalized linear models) which have been traditionally used for this purpose. Besides analyzing the adequacy of different components and topologies, we also focus on their extrapolation capability, a critical point for their potential application in climate change studies. To do this, we use a warm test period as a surrogate for possible future climate conditions.  Our results show that, while the added value of CNNs is mostly limited to the reproduction of extremes for temperature, these techniques do outperform the classic ones in the case of precipitation for most aspects considered. This overall good performance, together with the fact that they can be suitably applied to large regions (e.g., continents) without worrying about the spatial features being considered as predictors, can foster the use of statistical approaches in international initiatives such as Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX).},

To exhibit the threshold effect of electromagnetic induction, this paper presents a threshold flux-controlled memristor and examines its frequency-dependent pinched hysteresis loops. Using an electromagnetic induction current generated by the threshold memristor to replace the external current in 2-D Hindmarsh{\textendash}Rose (HR) neuron model, a 3-D memristive HR (mHR) neuron model with global hidden oscillations is established and the corresponding numerical simulations are performed. It is found that due to no equilibrium point, the obtained mHR neuron model always operates in hidden bursting firing patterns, including coexisting hidden bursting firing patterns with bistability also. In addition, the model exhibits complex dynamics of the actual neuron electrical activities, which acts like the 3-D HR neuron model, indicating its feasibility. In particular, by constructing the fold and Hopf bifurcation sets of the fastscale subsystem, the bifurcation mechanisms of hidden bursting firings are expounded. Finally, circuit experiments on hardware breadboards are deployed and the captured results well match with the numerical results, validating the physical mechanism of biological neuron and the reliability of electronic neuron.},

These needs have motivated the development of new approaches to signal acquisition and processing. We provide an introduction to the field of compressive sensing (CS), which has stimulated a rethinking of sensor and signal processing system design. In CS, analog signals are digitized and processed not via uniform sampling but via measurements using more general, even random, test functions. In contrast to conventional wisdom, the new theory asserts that one can combine ``sub-Nyquist rate sampling'' with large-scale optimization for efficient and accurate signal acquisition when the signal has a sparse structure. Particular topics addressed include signal sparsity, randomized sampling, optimization-based signal recovery, and perspectives on applications to seismic data acquisition and processing.},

Even without any changes in precipitation intensity, both of these effects lead to a shift in peak river runoff to winter and early spring, away from summer and autumn when demand is highest. Where storage capacities are not sufficient, much of the winter runoff will immediately be lost to the oceans. With more than one-sixth of the Earth's population relying on glaciers and seasonal snow packs for their water supply, the consequences of these hydrological changes for future water availability{\textemdash}predicted with high confidence and already diagnosed in some regions{\textemdash}are likely to be severe.},

They reflect former regions of glacier initiation, and their distribution is, therefore, linked to palaeoclimate. Because of this association, cirques can be analysed for the information they provide about past environments, an approach that has a strong heritage, and has seen resurgence over recent years. This paper provides a critical assessment of what cirques can tell us about past environments, and considers their reliability as palaeoenvironmental proxies. Specific focus is placed on information that can be obtained from consideration of cirque distribution, aspect, altitude, and morphometry. The paper highlights the fact that cirques potentially provide information about the style, duration and intensity of former glaciation, as well as information about past temperatures, precipitation gradients, cloud-cover and wind directions. In all, cirques are considered a valuable source of palaeoenvironmental information (if used judiciously), particularly as they are ubiquitous within formerly glaciated mountain ranges globally, thus making regional or even global scale studies possible. Furthermore, cirques often occupy remote and inaccessible regions where other palaeoenvironmental proxies may be limited or lacking.},

  abstract = {Abstract We introduce a set of global high-resolution (0.05{$^\circ$}) precipitation (P) climatologies corrected for bias using streamflow (Q) observations from 9372 stations worldwide. For each station, we inferred the ``true'' long-term P using a Budyko curve, which is an empirical equation relating long-term P, Q, and potential evaporation. We subsequently calculated long-term bias correction factors for three state-of-the-art P climatologies [the ``WorldClim version 2'' database (WorldClim V2); Climatologies at High Resolution for the Earth's Land Surface Areas, version 1.2 (CHELSA V1.2 ); and Climate Hazards Group Precipitation Climatology, version 1 (CHPclim V1)], after which we used random-forest regression to produce global gap-free bias correction maps for the P climatologies. Monthly climatological bias correction factors were calculated by disaggregating the long-term bias correction factors on the basis of gauge catch efficiencies. We found that all three climatologies systematically underestimate P over parts of all major mountain ranges globally, despite the explicit consideration of orography in the production of each climatology. In addition, all climatologies underestimate P at latitudes {$>$}60{$^\circ$}N, likely because of gauge undercatch. Exceptionally high long-term correction factors ({$>$}1.5) were obtained for all three P climatologies in Alaska, High Mountain Asia, and Chile{\textemdash}regions characterized by marked elevation gradients, sparse gauge networks, and significant snowfall. Using the bias-corrected WorldClim V2, we demonstrated that other widely used P datasets (GPCC V2015, GPCP V2.3, and MERRA-2) severely underestimate P over Chile, the Himalayas, and along the Pacific coast of North America. Mean P for the global land surface based on the bias-corrected WorldClim V2 is 862 mm yr-1 (a 9.4\% increase over the original WorldClim V2). The annual and monthly bias-corrected P climatologies have been released as the Precipitation Bias Correction (PBCOR) dataset, which is available online (http://www.gloh2o.org/pbcor/).},

  abstract = {Abstract. The mountain cryosphere of mainland Europe is recognized to have important impacts on a~range of environmental processes. In this paper, we provide an overview on the current knowledge on snow, glacier, and permafrost processes, as well as their past, current, and future evolution. We additionally provide an assessment of current cryosphere research in Europe and point to the different domains requiring further research. Emphasis is given to our understanding of climate{\textendash}cryosphere interactions, cryosphere controls on physical and biological mountain systems, and related impacts. By the end of the century, Europe's mountain cryosphere will have changed to an extent that will impact the landscape, the hydrological regimes, the water resources, and the infrastructure. The impacts will not remain confined to the mountain area but also affect the downstream lowlands, entailing a~wide range of socioeconomical consequences. European mountains will have a~completely different visual appearance, in which low- and mid-range-altitude glaciers will have disappeared and even large valley glaciers will have experienced significant retreat and mass loss. Due to increased air temperatures and related shifts from solid to liquid precipitation, seasonal snow lines will be found at much higher altitudes, and the snow season will be much shorter than today. These changes in snow and ice melt will cause a~shift in the timing of discharge maxima, as well as a~transition of runoff regimes from glacial to nival and from nival to pluvial. This will entail significant impacts on the seasonality of high-altitude water availability, with consequences for water storage and management in reservoirs for drinking water, irrigation, and hydropower production. Whereas an upward shift of the tree line and expansion of vegetation can be expected into current periglacial areas, the disappearance of permafrost at lower altitudes and its warming at higher elevations will likely result in mass movements and process chains beyond historical experience. Future cryospheric research has the responsibility not only to foster awareness of these expected changes and to develop targeted strategies to precisely quantify their magnitude and rate of occurrence but also to help in the development of approaches to adapt to these changes and to mitigate their consequences. Major joint efforts are required in the domain of cryospheric monitoring, which will require coordination in terms of data availability and quality. In particular, we recognize the quantification of high-altitude precipitation as a~key source of uncertainty in projections of future changes. Improvements in numerical modeling and a~better understanding of process chains affecting high-altitude mass movements are the two further fields that~{\textendash} in our view~{\textendash} future cryospheric research should focus on.},

  abstract = {The spatial distribution of snow plays a vital role in sub-Arctic and Arctic climate, hydrology, and ecology due to its fundamental influence on the water balance, thermal regimes, vegetation, and carbon flux. However, the spatial distribution of snow is not well understood, and therefore, it is not well modeled, which can lead to substantial uncertainties in snow cover representations. To capture key hydro-ecological controls on snow spatial distribution, we carried out intensive field studies over multiple years for two small (2017{\textendash}2019; {$\sim$} 2.5 km2) sub-Arctic study sites located on the Seward Peninsula of Alaska. Using an intensive suite of field observations ({$>$} 22 000 data points), we developed simple models of the spatial distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE) using factors such as topographic characteristics, vegetation characteristics based on greenness (normalized different vegetation index, NDVI), and a simple metric for approximating winds. The most successful model was random forest, using both study sites and all years, which was able to accurately capture the complexity and variability of snow characteristics across the sites. Approximately 86 \% of the SWE distribution could be accounted for, on average, by the random forest model at the study sites. Factors that impacted year-to-year snow distribution included NDVI, elevation, and a metric to represent coarse microtopography (topographic position index, TPI), while slope, wind, and fine microtopography factors were less important. The characterization of the SWE spatial distribution patterns will be used to validate and improve snow distribution modeling in the Department of Energy's Earth system model and for improved understanding of hydrology, topography, and vegetation dynamics in the sub-Arctic and Arctic regions of the globe.},

These sequences contain the organic rich shales of the Nordmela Fm. and the reservoir rock of the Sto Fm. Organic rich shales of the Olderfjord Fm. were deposited during Late Jurassic. The Hammerfest Basin formed through down-faulting in Early Cretaceous times. This provided the preservation of Jurassic sequences which later were covered by Cretaceous and Tertiary sequences filling the basin. The Jurassic source rocks reached significant maturation towards Mid Oligocene time when the area was subjected to significant uplift and subsequent erosion. Consequently the maturation of Jurassic source rocks was slowed down, and the hydrocarbon generation in parts of the basin was reduced. -from Authors},

The method handles the full six degrees of freedom and is based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which requires only a procedure to find the closest point on a geometric entity to a given point. The ICP algorithm always converges monotonically to the nearest local minimum of a mean-square distance metric, and the rate of convergence is rapid during the first few iterations. Therefore, given an adequate set of initial rotations and translations for a particular class of objects with a certain level of 'shape complexity', one can globally minimize the mean-square distance metric over all six degrees of freedom by testing each initial registration. One important application of this method is to register sensed data from unfixtured rigid objects with an ideal geometric model, prior to shape inspection. Experimental results show the capabilities of the registration algorithm on point sets, curves, and surfaces.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {Snow depth is highly variable across basins, yet most snow depth data in the western U.S. come from sparse in situ point measurements. The water resources community needs accurate snow depth data for improved basin-wide snow depth estimates. The NASA ICESat-2 mission has provided over four years of global satellite laser altimetry measurements since October 2018. Previous studies have shown that standard ICESat-2 data products, when combined with snow-off digital terrain models (DTMs) from airborne laser scanning, have the potential to provide snow depth measurements with varying accuracy depending on factors such as surface slope and canopy cover. In this study we show that ICESat-2 snow depth measurements can be improved with customized data products generated using the SlideRule Earth service. Here we investigate the accuracy of our ICESat-2 SlideRule snow depth method using four years (2019{\textendash}2022) of reference in situ snow depth measurements and airborne lidar snow depth observations for two watersheds with varying terrain characteristics: the Tuolumne River basin above Hetch Hetchy, CA and the Methow Valley, WA. We observe median differences of -0.14 m (RMSE of 0.18 m) and -0.20 m (RMSE of 0.33 m) between our ICESat-2 snow depth measurements and reference snow depth measurements for the Tuolumne Basin and Methow Valley sites, respectively. While individual ICESat-2 elevation measurements can contain noise, basin-scale aggregation offers robust statistics for snow depth. Differences in accuracy between sites are attributed to terrain characteristics and their spatial distributions. The customized ICESat-2 SlideRule data products used in this study resulted in more accurate median snow depth values, including under canopy, than those found by previous studies using standard ICESat-2 data products in mid-latitude mountainous regions. When combined with snow-off DTMs, the aggregated snow-on ICESat-2 SlideRule observations could provide a new snow depth dataset across the western U.S. and potentially global land surfaces.},

The joint distribution of daily-mean wind speeds and irradiances shows that irradiance has a much stronger seasonal cycle than wind, due to the rotational tilt of the Earth. Irradiance is weakly anticorrelated with wind speed throughout the year (-0.4{$\lessequivlnt\rho\lessequivlnt-$}0.2): there is a weak tendency for windy days to be cloudier. This is particularly true in Atlantic-facing regions (western Scotland, south-west England). The east coast of Britain has the weakest anticorrelation, particularly in winter, primarily associated with a relative increase in the frequency of clear-but-windy days. We also consider the variability in total power output from onshore wind turbines and solar photovoltaic panels. In all months, daily variability in total power is always reduced by incorporating solar capacity. The scenario with the least seasonal variability is approximately 70\%-solar to 30\%-wind. This work emphasises the importance of considering the full distribution of daily behaviour rather than relying on long-term average relationships or correlations. In particular, the anticorrelation between wind and solar power in Britain cannot solely be relied upon to produce a well-balanced energy supply.},

The accuracy of SRTM DEM is measured as a function of land covers and geomorphologic characteristics. The typical mean vertical difference between the SRTM DEM and ICESat elevations in this paper was determined in each classified land-use type and is approximately 1.5 m over bare ground, with the SRTM measuring lower elevations. Significant changes in the SRTM DEM uncertainties have been identified over different surface types classified from Landsat-7 imagery, e.g., bare ground, urban, and forested areas. Based on this result, the difference of the SRTM 30-m DEM and ICESat elevations has been removed from the DEM and made available for improved hydrological applications.},

  abstract = {Weather forecasting is important for science and society. At present, the most accurate forecast system is the numerical weather prediction (NWP) method, which represents atmospheric states as discretized grids and numerically solves partial differential equations that describe the transition between those states1. However, this procedure is computationally expensive. Recently, artificial-intelligence-based methods2 have shown potential in accelerating weather forecasting by orders of magnitude, but the forecast accuracy is still significantly lower than that of NWP methods. Here we introduce an artificial-intelligence-based method for accurate, medium-range global weather forecasting. We show that three-dimensional deep networks equipped with Earth-specific priors are effective at dealing with complex patterns in weather data, and that a hierarchical temporal aggregation strategy reduces accumulation errors in medium-range forecasting. Trained on 39\,years of global data, our program, Pangu-Weather, obtains stronger deterministic forecast results on reanalysis data in all tested variables when compared with the world's best NWP system, the operational integrated forecasting system of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)3. Our method also works well with extreme weather forecasts and ensemble forecasts. When initialized with reanalysis data, the accuracy of tracking tropical cyclones is also higher than that of ECMWF-HRES.},

Many sectors have benefited from this by increasing productivity while also decreasing costs and certain risks to humans. These robots can be controlled individually but are more efficient in a large group, also known as a swarm. However, an increase in the quantity and complexity of robots creates the need for an adequate control system. Reinforcement learning, an artificial intelligence paradigm, is an increasingly popular approach to control a swarm of unmanned vehicles. The quantity of reviews in the field of reinforcement learning-based swarm robotics is limited. We propose reviewing the various applications, algorithms and simulators on the subject to fill this gap. First, we present the current applications on swarm robotics with a focus on reinforcement learning control systems. Subsequently, we define important reinforcement learning terminologies, followed by a review of the current state-of-the-art in the field of swarm robotics utilizing reinforcement learning. Additionally, we review the various simulators used to train, validate and simulate swarms of unmanned vehicles.

  abstract = {Direct wave arrivals are the most robust signals to determine velocity. They have been used for almost a century in hydrocarbon exploration. This is because the arrival time is explicitly available and provides a direct measurement of the average velocity of the subsurface raypath. To acquire these direct arrivals in a seismic experimental setting, it is necessary that the waves turn back to the surface after they start traveling into the earth. As is well known, it is possible to turn waves back up if they encounter faster propagation velocities than previously experienced. Using these simple concepts, we show how it is possible to design a seismic acquisition to measure subsalt velocities when the salt cover is very thick and potentially not homogeneous. Until now in marine seismic surveying, the physical limitations of the earth meant that the use of direct wave arrivals was restricted to relatively shallow depths of investigation. By combining the application of node technology with a well-established physical phenomena (i.e., refraction in the basement), it is possible to retrieve subsalt velocities from seismic surveys.},

  abstract = {The nature and severity of climate change impacts vary significantly from region to region. Consequently, high-resolution climate information is needed for meaningful impact assessments and the design of mitigation strategies. This demand has led to an increase in the coupling of Empirical Statistical Downscaling (ESD) models to General Circulation Model (GCM) simulations of future climate. In contrast to dynamical downscaling, the Perfect Prognosis ESD (PP-ESD) approach has several benefits, including low computation costs, the prevention of the propagation of GCM specific errors, and high compatibility with different GCMs. Despite their advantages, the use of ESD models and the resulting data products is hampered by (1) the lack of accessible and user-friendly downscaling software packages that implement the entire downscaling cycle, (2) difficulties to reproduce existing data products and assess their credibility, and (3) difficulties to reconcile different ESD-based predictions for the same region. We address these issues with a new open-source Python PP-ESD modeling framework pyESD. pyESD implements the entire downscaling cycle, i.e., routines for data preparation, predictor selection and construction, model selection and training, evaluation, utility tools for relevant statistical tests, visualization, and more. The package includes a collection of well-established Machine Learning algorithms and allows the user to choose a variety of estimators, cross-validation schemes, objective function measures, hyperparameter optimization, etc., in relatively few lines of code. The package is well documented, highly modular, and flexible. It allows quick and reproducible downscaling of any climate information, such as precipitation, temperature, wind speed, or even short-term glacier length and mass changes. We demonstrate the use and the effectiveness of the new PP-ESD framework by generating weather station-based downscaling products for precipitation and temperature in complex mountainous terrain in Southwest Germany. The application example covers all important steps of the downing cycle and different levels of experimental complexity. All scripts and datasets used in the case study are publicly available to (1) ensure the reproducibility and replicability of the modeled results, and (2) simplify learning to use the software package.},

The rate of permafrost thaw is controlled by surface and subsurface properties and processes, all of which are potentially linked with each other. However, no standardized protocol exists for measuring permafrost thaw and related processes and properties in a linked manner. The permafrost thaw action group of the Terrestrial Multidisciplinary distributed Observatories for the Study of the Arctic Connections (T-MOSAiC) project has developed a protocol, for use by non-specialist scientists and technicians, citizen scientists, and indigenous groups, to collect standardized metadata and data on permafrost thaw. The protocol introduced here addresses the need to jointly measure permafrost thaw and the associated surface and subsurface environmental conditions. The parameters measured along transects include: snow depth, thaw depth, vegetation height, soil texture, and water level. The metadata collection includes data on timing of data collection, geographical coordinates, land surface characteristics (vegetation, ground surface, water conditions), as well as photographs. Our hope is that this openly available dataset will also be highly valuable for validation and parameterization of numerical and conceptual models, and thus to the broad community represented by the T-MOSAiC project.},

  abstract = {Uncertainty in the interpretation of geological data is an inherent element of geology. Datasets from different sources: remotely sensed seismic imagery, field data and borehole data, are often combined and interpreted to create a geological model of the sub-surface. The data have limited resolution and spatial distribution that results in uncertainty in the interpretation of the data and in the subsequent geological model(s) created. Methods to determine the extent of interpretational uncertainty of a dataset, how to capture and express that uncertainty, and consideration of uncertainties in terms of risk have been investigated. Here I review the work that has taken place and discuss best practice in accounting for uncertainties in structural interpretation workflows. Barriers to best practice are reflected on, including the use of software packages for interpretation. Experimental evidence suggests that minimising interpretation error through the use of geological reasoning and rules can help decrease interpretation uncertainty; through identification of inadmissible interpretations and in highlighting areas of uncertainty. Understanding expert thought processes and reasoning, including the use of visuospatial skills, during interpretation may aid in the identification of uncertainties, and in the education of new geoscientists. {\copyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Firstly, we have systematically mapped the occurrence of palsas and peat plateaus in the northernmost county of Norway (Finnmark, {$\sim\&$}thinsp;50 000 km\textsuperscript{2}) by manual interpretation of aerial images from 2005 to 2014 at a spatial resolution of 250 m. At this resolution, mires and wetlands with palsas or peat plateaus occur in about 850 km\textsuperscript{2} of Finnmark, with the actual palsas and peat plateaus underlain by permafrost covering a surface area of approximately 110 km\textsuperscript{2}. Secondly, we have quantified the lateral changes of the extent of palsas and peat plateaus for four study areas located along a NW\&ndash;SE transect through Finnmark by utilizing repeat aerial imagery from the 1950s to the 2010s. The results of the lateral changes reveal a total decrease of 33\&ndash;71 \% in the areal extent of palsas and peat plateaus during the study period, with the largest lateral change rates observed in the last decade. However, the results indicate that degradation of palsas and peat plateaus in northern Norway has been a consistent process during the second half of the 20th century and possibly even earlier. Significant rates of areal change are observed in all investigated time periods since the 1950s, and thermokarst landforms observed on aerial images from the 1950s suggest that lateral degradation was already an ongoing process at this time. The results of this study show that lateral erosion of palsas and peat plateaus is an important pathway for permafrost degradation in the sporadic permafrost zone in northern Scandinavia. While the environmental factors governing the rate of erosion are not yet fully understood, we note a moderate increase in air temperature, precipitation and snow depth during the last few decades in the region.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Regional studies of fluvial landforms and long-term (Quaternary) landscape development in remote mountain landscapes routinely use satellite-derived DEM data sets. The SRTM and ASTER DEMs are the most commonly utilised because of their longer availability, free cost, and ease of access. However, rapid technological developments mean that newer and higher resolution DEM data sets such as ALOS World 3D (AW3D) and TanDEM-X are being released to the scientific community. Geomorphologists are thus faced with an increasingly problematic challenge of selecting an appropriate DEM for their landscape analyses. Here, we test the application of four medium resolution DEM products (30 m = SRTM, ASTER, AW3D; 12 m = TanDEM-X) for qualitative and quantitative analysis of a fluvial mountain landscape using the Dades River catchment (High Atlas Mountains, Morocco). This landscape comprises significant DEM remote sensing challenges, notably a high mountain relief, steep slopes, and a deeply incised high sinuosity drainage network with narrow canyon/gorge reaches. Our goal was to see which DEM produced the most representative best fit drainage network and meaningful quantification. To achieve this, we used ArcGIS and Stream Profiler platforms to generate catchment hillshade and slope rasters and to extract drainage network, channel long profile and channel slope, and area data. TanDEM-X produces the clearest landscape representation but with channel routing errors in localised high relief areas. Thirty-metre DEMs are smoother and less detailed, but the AW3D shows the closest fit to the real drainage network configuration. The TanDEM-X elevation values are the closest to field-derived GPS measurements. Long profiles exhibit similar shapes but with minor differences in length, elevation, and the degree of noise/smoothing, with AW3D producing the best representation. Slope-area plots display similarly positioned slope-break knickpoints with modest differences in steepness and concavity indices, but again best represented by AW3D. Collectively, our study shows that despite the higher effective resolution of TanDEM-X (12 m), the AW3D (30 m) data performs strongly across all analyses suggesting that it currently offers the greatest potential for regional mountain geomorphological analyses.},

Mass balance and ELA for individual glaciers are usually strongly correlated and we calculate balanced-budget ELA from the regression equation linking the two. We then compare balanced-budget ELA with area-median and mid-range altitudes for the 94 glaciers for which we have all the necessary data. The different ELA estimates agree well enough ({$\pm$}82 to {$\pm$}125 m) to describe geographical variations in ELA and for application of glacier{\textendash}climate models to glacier inventory data.

Using two recent case examples, we review the key stages of the evaluation process and share the derived conclusions. The primary goal of these studies was to investigate and validate the image improvement associated with an OBS survey. The studies helped establish the optimal OBS geometry design by benchmarking it against legacy data as well as a number of alternative towed streamer and ocean-bottom acquisition solutions. The secondary goal of these studies was to increase the understanding of OBS acquisition options that is, ocean-bottom node (OBN) acquisition and ocean-bottom cable (OBC) acquisition. Using a multiphase feasibility study, which integrates geometry design, illumination analysis, and finite-difference modelling, we were able to successfully evaluate the suitability and value of OBS for a number of seismic acquisitions in the North Sea. By investigating the natural sampling, illumination characteristics, and processing considerations of each geometry, we were able to design and optimise an OBS geometry that met the imaging and operational challenges of each area.},

The two conventional sources and our LFS operated simultaneously into the same ocean-bottom receivers. The LFS data differ significantly in character from conventional airgun data, and cannot be used to produce migrated seismic images on their own. Instead the data are optimized for velocity-model building using FWI, with seismic imaging performed using the conventional source data. The field trial was designed to supplement conventional airgun data below 4 Hz for the purposes of velocity-model building using low-frequency, wide-offset Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI). The field trial was successful, and preliminary results indicate that the source achieved its objectives of good signal-to-noise at 1.7 Hz out to offsets approaching 30 km.

LFS data were shot on a very coarse grid (280 m inline, 2 to 4 km crossline) and recorded into a spread of Ocean-Bottom Nodes (OBN) simultaneously with airgun sources shooting on a conventional dense grid (50 m inline, 50 m crossline sampling). Analysis of the recorded low-frequency data from both the LFS and conventional airguns showed a significant improvement in signal-to-noise (S/N) quality over the design frequency range of 1.7 to 2.5 Hz, especially at long offsets. However, using the LFS data with FWI to improve the velocity model for imaging produced only an incremental uplift in the sub-salt image quality in the reservoir zone, albeit with clear improvements at depths of greater than 25,000 feet.},

In the last deglacial period, the rate of global sea-level rise peaked at more than 4\,cm\,yr-1 during Meltwater Pulse 1A, which coincided with the B{\o}lling warming event some 14,650 years ago. However, the sources of the meltwater have proven elusive, and the contribution from Eurasian ice sheets has been considered negligible. Here, we present a regional carbon-14 calibration curve for the Norwegian Sea and recalibrate marine 14C dates linked to the Eurasian Ice Sheet retreat. We find that marine-based sectors of the Eurasian Ice Sheet collapsed at the B{\o}lling transition and lost an ice volume of 4.5{\textendash}7.9\,m sea-level equivalents (SLE) over 500 years. During peak melting, 3.3{\textendash}6.7\,m SLE of ice was lost, potentially explaining up to half of Meltwater Pulse 1A. A mean meltwater flux of 0.2\,Sv over 300 years was injected into the Norwegian Sea and the Arctic Ocean at a time when proxy evidence suggests vigorous Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. Our reconstruction shows that massive marine-based ice sheets can collapse in as little as 300{\textendash}500 years.},

  abstract = {Ranges obtained by radar altimetry from a satellite to a sloping surface on the earth are not measurements of the surface elevation at the subsatellite point. Instead, the reflecting point is displaced upslope from the subsatellite point causing a 'slope-induced error' between the true range to the subsatellite point and the indicated range. For the SEASAT 1 altimeter, this range error is nearly 80 m for a 0.8 degree slope. Ice sheet surface slopes are frequently large enough to cause errors of 10 m or more. In addition, undulations in the surface about a mean slope cause pronounced variations in these errors. Altimeter measurements of ranges to modeled irregular surfaces are simulated and two correction schemes are used to reconstruct the modeled surfaces from the simulated data. The results illustrate the fundamental limitations inherent in single-beam radar altimetry for mapping irregular surfaces. In the simpler two-dimensional case, for which cross-track slopes are neglected, a relocation scheme, which constructs a surface consistent with the altimeter ranges, removes 85\% of the rms error. The mean error along profiles of about 75 km or longer is usually reduced more than the rms error. An alternate slope correction scheme, which uses the local slope to calculate the expected error, is less effective in the two-dimensional case. However, over a simulated three-dimensional surface, where groundtracks are widely spaced and cross-track slopes are significant, the slope-correction method must be used in at least the cross-track direction. The effectiveness of the three-dimensional correction depends on the relative size of the errors caused by the local slope on surface undulations in comparison to the regional slope.},

Cross-mission crossover analysis between time-coincident ERS-2-, Envisat-, and ICESat-retrieved elevations and comparisons to an ICESat-derived digital elevation map are used to quantify the radar elevation error budget as a function of surface slope and to investigate the effectiveness of a method to account for the radar altimeter slope-induced error.

This delivers both enhanced spatial and temporal sampling and the ability to relax streamer spacing requirements. The `standard' flipflop source configuration becomes somewhat redundant due to wavefield reconstruction that allows us to use sources in a different flip-flop configuration to improve efficiency and/or source sampling. This paper discusses the overall concept and a field test where sources were deployed in a wide-tow configuration to acquire a test dataset. In this field test a 150 m source separation was achieved with a modified towing configuration and a dataset acquired for processing and evaluation. We see improvements in efficiency as well as geophysical benefits accruing from this new type of field configuration and also applications beyond towed streamers to seabed acquisition.},

  abstract = {The interpretation of differentially weathered mountainous areas along the fringes of Pleistocene ice sheets is fundamental for determining ice-sheet behavior and thickness during the last glaciation. Two existing interpretations are either that highly weathered uplands remained as nunataks while freshly eroded troughs held outlet glaciers during the last glaciation or that uplands and lowlands were equally covered by ice, but that it was differentially erosive as a function of its spatially variable basal thermal regime. Cosmogenic radionuclide measurements from 33 bedrock samples and 27 upland erratics from differentially weathered fiord landscapes on northeastern Baffin Island shed light on Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) dynamics and thickness. Tors on weathered upland surfaces have minimum 10Be ages between ca. 50 and ca. 170 ka (n = 12), whereas the majority of erratics perched in the uplands range from ca. 10 to ca. 13 ka (n = 14), indicating that the whole landscape was glaciated during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Glacially sculpted bedrock (n = 7) near sea level reflects the age of deglaciation, and increasing amounts of isotopic inheritance in high-elevation sculpted bedrock (n = 3), higher elevation intermediately weathered bedrock (n = 11), and highest elevation intensely weathered bedrock reflect the weakening of erosive power as the ice sheet transitioned from fiords to interfiord plateaus.Cold-based glaciation of uplands was contemporaneous with warm-based glaciation in fiords, suggesting the presence of ice streams. 26Al and 10Be concentrations measured in 10 bedrock samples indicate that tors have experienced a complex history of alternating periods of exposure, burial, and limited glacial erosion. The paired isotope data reveal a minimum duration of burial of 80{\textendash}500 k.y., presumably by cold-based ice, and indicate that the tors have an age of at least 150{\textendash}580 ka. These data, together with other reconstructions of ice streams in the eastern Canadian Arctic, suggest that ice streams were a large influence on northeastern LIS dynamics throughout the late Quaternary. Thus, the northeastern LIS was sensitively tied with North Atlantic thermohaline circulation and abrupt climate change.},

Under conditions of warming and increasing precipitation that characterizes both observed and projected climate change over much of the NH land area with seasonal snow cover, the sensitivity analysis indicated snow cover duration (SCD) was the snow cover variable exhibiting the strongest climate sensitivity, with sensitivity varying with climate regime and elevation. The highest snow cover{\textendash}climate sensitivity was found in maritime climates with extensive winter snowfall{\textemdash}for example, the coastal mountains of western North America (NA). Analysis of trends in snow cover duration during the 1966{\textendash}2007 period of NOAA data showed the largest decreases were concentrated in a zone where seasonal mean air temperatures were in the range of -5{$^\circ$} to +5{$^\circ$}C that extended around the midlatitudinal coastal margins of the continents. These findings were echoed by the climate models that showed earlier and more widespread decreases in SCD than annual maximum snow water equivalent (SWEmax), with the zone of earliest significant decrease located over the maritime margins of NA and western Europe. The lowest SCD{\textendash}climate sensitivity was observed in continental interior climates with relatively cold and dry winters, where precipitation plays a greater role in snow cover variability. The sensitivity analysis suggested a potentially complex elevation response of SCD and SWEmax to increasing temperature and precipitation in mountain regions as a result of nonlinear interactions between the duration of the snow season and snow accumulation rates.},

The behavior of this parameter exhibits a distinct periodicity with more internal fluctuations. This overview prompts us to a description of the physical basis of the climate system, capable of explaining such fluctuations. The system is the star-planet, initially described as a lamp-billiard ball simple system. Astronomical causes affect the distance lamp-billiard ball (star-planet) and the ball (Earth) rotation axis orientation, while astronomical causes affect the intensity of radiation emitted from the lamp (Sun). The complication introduced by the atmosphere is then explained, essentially through the triatomic gas molecules, aerosol and clouds. Atmospheric composition affects incoming solar radiation and outgoing infrared one. The compartments relevant for climate definition are examined: lithosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, biosphere including vegetation and humans. However due to space limitations the interactions between the different compartments are not treated here and we restrict ourselves to the treatment of the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Information on snow depth and its spatial distribution is important for numerous applications, including natural hazard management, snow water equivalent estimation for hydropower, the study of the distribution and evolution of flora and fauna, and the validation of snow hydrological models. Due to its heterogeneity and complexity, specific remote sensing tools are required to accurately map the snow depth distribution in Alpine terrain. To cover large areas (\&gt;100 km2), airborne laser scanning (ALS) or aerial photogrammetry with large-format cameras is needed. While both systems require piloted aircraft for data acquisition, ALS is typically more expensive than photogrammetry but yields better results in forested terrain. While photogrammetry is slightly cheaper, it is limited due to its dependency on favourable acquisition conditions (weather, light conditions). In this study, we present photogrammetrically processed high-spatial-resolution (0.5 m) annual snow depth maps, recorded during the peak of winter over a 5-year period under different acquisition conditions over a study area around Davos, Switzerland. Compared to previously carried out studies, using the Vexcel UltraCam Eagle Mark 3 (M3) sensor improves the average ground sampling distance to 0.1 m at similar flight altitudes above ground. This allows for very detailed snow depth maps in open areas, calculated by subtracting a snow-off digital terrain model (DTM, acquired with ALS) from the snow-on digital surface models (DSMs) processed from the airborne imagery. Despite challenging acquisition conditions during the recording of the UltraCam images (clouds, shaded areas and fresh snow), 99 \% of unforested areas were successfully photogrammetrically reconstructed. We applied masks (high vegetation, settlements, water, glaciers) to increase the reliability of the snow depth calculations. An extensive accuracy assessment was carried out using check points, the comparison to DSMs derived from unpiloted aerial systems and the comparison of snow-free DSM pixels to the ALS DTM. The results show a root mean square error of approximately 0.25 m for the UltraCam X and 0.15 m for the successor, the UltraCam Eagle M3. We developed a consistent and reliable photogrammetric workflow for accurate snow depth distribution mapping over large regions, capable of analysing snow distribution in complex terrain. This enables more detailed investigations on seasonal snow dynamics and can be used for numerous applications related to snow depth distribution, as well as serving as a ground reference for new modelling approaches and satellite-based snow depth mapping.},

DA incorporates observational data into a prediction model to improve forecasted results. These models have increased in sophistication to better fit application requirements and circumvent implementation issues. Nevertheless, these approaches are incapable of fully overcoming their unrealistic assumptions. Machine Learning (ML) shows great capability in approximating nonlinear systems and extracting meaningful features from high-dimensional data. ML algorithms are capable of assisting or replacing traditional forecasting methods. However, the data used during training in any Machine Learning (ML) algorithm include numerical, approximation and round off errors, which are trained into the forecasting model. Integration of ML with DA increases the reliability of prediction by including information with a physical meaning. This work provides an introduction to Data Learning, a field that integrates Data Assimilation and Machine Learning to overcome limitations in applying these fields to real-world data. The fundamental equations of DA and ML are presented and developed to show how they can be combined into Data Learning. We present a number of Data Learning methods and results for some test cases, though the equations are general and can easily be applied elsewhere.},

He argues that when large-scale GCM variables are rescaled directly to small-scale fields or even station data, genuine small-scale covariability is lost and replaced by uniform variability inherited from the larger scales. This leads to a misrepresentation mainly of areal means and long-term trends. This comment acknowledges the former point, although the argument is relatively old, but disagrees with the latter, showing that grid-size long-term trends can be different from local trends. Finally, because it is partly incorrectly addressed, some clarification is added regarding the inflation issue, stressing that neither randomization nor inflation is free of unverified assumptions.},

The imperfect variability results from incomplete forcing of the large scales. The last IPCC report mentioned three regression-based methods that try to overcome the imperfection of point-wise variability: randomization, inflation, and expanded downscaling, Here, we analyze and compare these methods with respect to their spatial variability and how that relates to river runoff. Using the downscaled temperature and precipitation for observed and simulated large-scale forcings (climate scenarios), we applied the hydrologic model HBV for two river basins in Germany. We discuss the obvious and hidden model imperfections regarding present and future precipitation climate, along with their relevance for runoff. The overall picture is quite diverse, and it appears that temporal characteristics, i.e. time-lagged effects, are at least as important as spatial characteristics. We conclude that, although the models agree in a number of essential projections for river flow, a more consistent picture requires the full spatio-temporal variability as it depends on the large scale atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Abstract Five statistical downscaling methods [automated regression-based statistical downscaling (ASD), bias correction spatial disaggregation (BCSD), quantile regression neural networks (QRNN), TreeGen (TG), and expanded downscaling (XDS)] are compared with respect to representing climatic extremes. The tests are conducted at six stations from the coastal, mountainous, and taiga region of British Columbia, Canada, whose climatic extremes are measured using the 27 Climate Indices of Extremes (ClimDEX; http://www.climdex.org/climdex/index.action) indices. All methods are calibrated from data prior to 1991, and tested against the two decades from 1991 to 2010. A three-step testing procedure is used to establish a given method as reliable for any given index. The first step analyzes the sensitivity of a method to actual index anomalies by correlating observed and NCEP-downscaled annual index values; then, whether the distribution of an index corresponds to observations is tested. Finally, this latter test is applied to a downscaled climate simulation. This gives a total of 486 single and 162 combined tests. The temperature-related indices pass about twice as many tests as the precipitation indices, and temporally more complex indices that involve consecutive days pass none of the combined tests. With respect to regions, there is some tendency of better performance at the coastal and mountaintop stations. With respect to methods, XDS performed best, on average, with 19\% (48\%) of passed combined (single) tests, followed by BCSD and QRNN with 10\% (45\%) and 10\% (31\%), respectively, ASD with 6\% (23\%), and TG with 4\% (21\%) of passed tests. Limitations of the testing approach and possible consequences for the downscaling of extremes in these regions are discussed.},

Feedbacks to the climate system have global consequences. The livelihoods and well-being of Arctic residents and many services for the wider population depend on snow conditions so changes have important consequences. Already, changing snow conditions, particularly reduced summer soil moisture, winter thaw events and rain-on-snow conditions have negatively affected commercial forestry, reindeer herding, some wild animal populations and vegetation. Reductions in snow cover are also adversely impacting indigenous peoples' access to traditional foods with negative impacts on human health and well-being. However, there are likely to be some benefits from a changing Arctic snow regime such as more even run-off from melting snow that favours hydropower operations.},

Here, an image processing technique designed to transfer colour information from one image to another{\textemdash}the N-dimensional probability density function transform{\textemdash}is adapted for use as a multivariate bias correction algorithm (MBCn) for climate model projections/predictions of multiple climate variables. MBCn is a multivariate generalization of quantile mapping that transfers all aspects of an observed continuous multivariate distribution to the corresponding multivariate distribution of variables from a climate model. When applied to climate model projections, changes in quantiles of each variable between the historical and projection period are also preserved. The MBCn algorithm is demonstrated on three case studies. First, the method is applied to an image processing example with characteristics that mimic a climate projection problem. Second, MBCn is used to correct a suite of 3-hourly surface meteorological variables from the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis Regional Climate Model (CanRCM4) across a North American domain. Components of the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System, a complicated set of multivariate indices that characterizes the risk of wildfire, are then calculated and verified against observed values. Third, MBCn is used to correct biases in the spatial dependence structure of CanRCM4 precipitation fields. Results are compared against a univariate quantile mapping algorithm, which neglects the dependence between variables, and two multivariate bias correction algorithms, each of which corrects a different form of inter-variable correlation structure. MBCn outperforms these alternatives, often by a large margin, particularly for annual maxima of the FWI distribution and spatiotemporal autocorrelation of precipitation fields.},

  abstract = {Abstract Quantile mapping bias correction algorithms are commonly used to correct systematic distributional biases in precipitation outputs from climate models. Although they are effective at removing historical biases relative to observations, it has been found that quantile mapping can artificially corrupt future model-projected trends. Previous studies on the modification of precipitation trends by quantile mapping have focused on mean quantities, with less attention paid to extremes. This article investigates the extent to which quantile mapping algorithms modify global climate model (GCM) trends in mean precipitation and precipitation extremes indices. First, a bias correction algorithm, quantile delta mapping (QDM), that explicitly preserves relative changes in precipitation quantiles is presented. QDM is compared on synthetic data with detrended quantile mapping (DQM), which is designed to preserve trends in the mean, and with standard quantile mapping (QM). Next, methods are applied to phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) daily precipitation projections over Canada. Performance is assessed based on precipitation extremes indices and results from a generalized extreme value analysis applied to annual precipitation maxima. QM can inflate the magnitude of relative trends in precipitation extremes with respect to the raw GCM, often substantially, as compared to DQM and especially QDM. The degree of corruption in the GCM trends by QM is particularly large for changes in long period return values. By the 2080s, relative changes in excess of +500\% with respect to historical conditions are noted at some locations for 20-yr return values, with maximum changes by DQM and QDM nearing +240\% and +140\%, respectively, whereas raw GCM changes are never projected to exceed +120\%.},

  abstract = {Digital elevation models (DEMs) are of fundamental importance for a large variety of scientific and commercial applications. Many geoscience studies require the most precise and current information about the Earth's topography. Independent quality assessments of these DEMs are crucial to their appropriate use in land process studies, as inputs to models, and for detection of topographic change. The Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) provided globally-distributed elevation data of high accuracy that demonstrated to be well-suited for evaluating continental DEMs after appropriate editing (Carabajal and Harding, 2005; Carabajal and Harding, 2006; Carabajal et al., 2010 and 2011; Carabajal and Boy, 2016). ICESat-2, launched on September 15th, 2018, provides an opportunity to develop a dataset suitable for Geodetic Ground Control. With increased coverage, ICESat-2/ATLAS features 6 laser beams with 532 nm wavelength, using photon counting technologies. With a nearly polar orbit, altimetry from ICESat-2 is available for latitudes reaching up to 88 degrees, on a 91-day repeat orbit with monthly sub-cycles. ICESat-2's footprint size is {\textasciitilde}17m, at 10 kHz pulse repetition frequency, or 0.75 m along track. Its pointing control is 45 m, with a pointing knowledge of 6.5 m, and a single photon precision of 800 ps. Sophisticated data processing techniques on the ground, optimized by surface type, produce high quality estimates of topography. We illustrate the use of ICESat-2 altimetry to assess DEM's accuracy using ATL08 release 002 elevations (Land and Vegetation) products (Neuenschwander and Pitts, 2019), showing comparable results to those using ICESat-derived Geodetic Ground Control.},

  abstract = {Cryospheric hazards in mountain ranges, at high latitudes, and around ice-covered volcanoes can adversely affect people by generating disasters such as glacial lake outburst floods, rock-ice landslides, lahars, and iceberg instability, as well as risks related to glacier runoff variability. These dangers are not simply biophysical; rather they are environmental events embedded within dynamic socio-ecological systems. To recognize the specific social and biophysical elements of cryospheric risks and hazards in particular, this chapter introduces the concept of the socio-cryospheric system. To improve adaptive capacity and effectively grapple with diverse risks and hazards in socio-cryospheric systems, integrated approaches that span the natural sciences, engineering and planning, and the social sciences are needed. The approach outlined here involves three elements: (1) understanding cryospheric risks and hazards through scientific investigation and the accumulation of environmental knowledge regarding the biophysical basis of the hazardous stimuli; (2) preventing the natural events from occurring through risk management and engineering strategies; and (3) reducing susceptibility to harm by addressing the socioeconomic, political, and cultural factors that influence vulnerability to risks, hazards, and disasters. This chapter analyzes several case studies of particular hazards (in particular places), including glacier and glacial lake hazards in Peru (Cordillera Blanca and Santa Teresa) and Nepal; volcano-ice hazards in Colombia; glacier runoff and meltwater related hazards in Nepal and Peru; and coastal hazards in Greenland. These case studies are not globally comprehensive but rather representative examples to help illustrate achievements and limitations of the threepronged approach to adaptation, while revealing opportunities for greater symbiosis among scientific-/knowledge-based, risk management-/engineering-based, and vulnerability-based approaches to adaptation and disaster risk reduction in socio-cryospheric systems.},

Over the last 50\,years, the Alps experienced a 5.6\% reduction per decade in snow cover duration, which already affects a region where economy and culture revolve, to a large extent, around winter. Here we present evidence from 572 ring-width series extracted from a prostrate shrub (Juniperus communis L.) growing at high elevation in the Val Ventina, Italy. These ring-width records show that the duration of current snowpack cover is 36\,days shorter than the long-term mean, a decline that is unprecedented over the last six centuries. These findings highlight the urgent need to develop adaptation strategies for some of the most sensitive environmental and socio-economic sectors in this region.},

  abstract = {Accurate depiction of the land and water is critical for the production of land surface parameters from remote sensing data products. Certain parameters, including the land surface temperature, active fires and surface reflectance, can be processed differently when the underlying surface is water as compared with land. Substantial errors in the underlying water mask can then pervade into these products and any products created from them. Historically many global databases have been created to depict global surface water. These databases still fall short of the current needs of the terrestrial remote sensing community working at 250 m spatial resolution. The most recent attempt to address the problem uses the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data set to create the SRTM Water Body Data set (SWBD 2005). The SWBD represents a good first step but still requires additional work to expand the spatial coverage to include the whole globe and to address some erroneous discontinuities in major river networks. To address this issue a new water mask product has been created using the SWBD in combination with MODIS 250 m data to create a complete global map of surface water at 250 m spatial resolution. This effort is automated and intended to produce a dataset for use in processing of raster data (MODIS and future instruments) and for masking out water in final terrestrial raster data products. This new global dataset is produced from remotely sensed data and provided to the public in digital format, free of charge. The data set can be found on the Global Land Cover Facility (GLCF) website at http://landcover.org. This dataset is expected to be a base set of information to describe the surface of Earth as either land or water which is a fundamental distinction upon which other descriptions can be made.},

It is a geological `Hubble', whose resolving power has already yielded some fascinating (and surprising) insights and will continue to provide a major stimulus for research into geological processes and products for many decades to come. Academic and other research institutions have a major role to play in the use of this data by exploiting the enormous volume of geological information contained in 3D seismic surveys.This paper reviews some of the recent advances in basin analysis made using the medium of 3D seismic data, focusing on the ¬¢elds of structural and sedimentary geology, {\pounds}uid\^rock interactions and igneous geology. It is noted that the increased resolution of the 3D seismic method provided the essential catalyst necessary to stimulate novel observations and discover new geological structures such as mud diapir feeders, km-long gas blow- out pipes, giant pockmarks and sandstone intrusions, and to capture the spatial variability of diagenetic fronts.The UKs ¬¢rst impact crater was also discovered using 3D seismic data.

This study remains very challenging despite decades of research, extensive progress in climate system modeling, and improvements in the availability and coverage of a wide variety of observations. Considerable obstacles in applying this knowledge to actual predictions remain.             This short article is a succint review paper about DCV and predictability. Based on listed issues and priorities, it also proposes a unifying theme referred to as ``drivers of teleconnectivity'' as a backbone to address and structure the core DCV research challenge. This framework goes beyond a preoccupation with changes in the global mean temperature and directly addresses the regional impacts of external (natural and anthropogenic) climate forcing and internal climate interactions; it thus explicitly deals with the societal needs for region-specific climate information. Such a framework also enables the integration of efforts in a large international research community toward advancing the observation, characterization, understanding, and prediction of DCV. Recommendations to make progress are provided as part of the contribution of the CLIVAR ``DCVP Research Focus'' group.},

  abstract = {Snow covers about 40 million km2 of the land area of the Northern Hemisphere during the winter season. The accumulation and depletion of snow is dynamically coupled with global hydrological and climatological processes. Snow covered area and snow water equivalent are two essential measurements. Snow cover maps are produced routinely by the National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA/NESDIS) and by the US Air Force Global Weather Center (USAFGWC). The snow covered area reported by these two groups sometimes differs by several million km2, Preliminary analysis is performed to evaluate the accuracy of these products.Microwave radiation penetrating through clouds and snowpacks could provide depth and water equivalent information about snow fields. Based on theoretical calculations, snow covered area and snow water equivalent retrieval algorithms have been developed. Snow cover maps for the Northern Hemisphere have been derived from Nimbus-7 SMMR data for a period of six years (1978{\textendash}1984). Intercomparisons of SMMR, NOAA/NESDIS and USAFGWC snow maps have been conducted to evaluate and assess the accuracy of SMMR derived snow maps. The total snow covered area derived from SMMR is usually about 10\% less than the other two products. This is because passive microwave sensors cannot detect shallow, dry snow which is less than 5 cm in depth. The major geographic regions in which the differences among these three products are the greatest are in central Asia and western China. Future study is required to determine the absolute accuracy of each product.Preliminary snow water equivalent maps have also been produced. Comparisons are made between retrieved snow water equivalent over large area and available snow depth measurements. The results of the comparisons are good for uniform snow covered areas, such as the Canadian high plains and the Russian steppes. Heavily forested and mountainous areas tend to mask out the microwave snow signatures and thus comparisons with measured water equivalent are poorer in those areas.},

  abstract = {Generative diffusion models can serve as a prior which ensures that solutions of image restoration systems adhere to the manifold of natural images. However, for restoring facial images, a personalized prior is necessary to accurately represent and reconstruct unique facial features of a given individual. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet effective, method for personalized restoration, called Dual-Pivot Tuning - a two-stage approach that personalize a blind restoration system while maintaining the integrity of the general prior and the distinct role of each component. Our key observation is that for optimal personalization, the generative model should be tuned around a fixed text pivot, while the guiding network should be tuned in a generic (non-personalized) manner, using the personalized generative model as a fixed ``pivot". This approach ensures that personalization does not interfere with the restoration process, resulting in a natural appearance with high fidelity to the person's identity and the attributes of the degraded image. We evaluated our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively through extensive experiments with images of widely recognized individuals, comparing it against relevant baselines. Surprisingly, we found that our personalized prior not only achieves higher fidelity to identity with respect to the person's identity, but also outperforms state-of-the-art generic priors in terms of general image quality.

  abstract = {Regulators, planners, and adaptation professionals increasingly use data-intensive approaches to estimate and plan for climate-driven risks. Today, many of these analyses involve the use of climate projection data from global climate models. However, those data are not often ready for applications because they are too spatially coarse and/or systematically biased. Scientists employ a post-processing technique called "downscaling" to address these challenges. However, downscaling is a complex analytical process, relying on several disparate computational steps, and the resulting datasets are often large and cumbersome to inspect. As a result, it is challenging to compare downscaling methods and how they affect downstream climate impact projections. Here we present a fully open source downscaling effort (https://github.com/carbonplan/cmip6-downscaling) and an accompanying interactive web tool (carbonplan.org/research/cmip6-downscaling) that aims to enable evaluation of different models and methods. Our dataset includes results from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) downscaled globally using multiple algorithms to the {\textasciitilde}25-km scale for the period 1950-2100 at a daily temporal resolution. The use of multiple downscaling algorithms facilitates intercomparison, exposing where methodological choices impact future projections. We build on a growing open source ecosystem for producing cloud-optimized, open source climate data using reproducible methods. In particular, we engaged with the Pangeo open science community effort, directly benefitting from their CMIP6 data warehouse and catalog. We also relied on, and contributed to, Pangeo-supported open source packages like Xbatcher, Xarray, and Scikit-downscale. Our approach can be deployed on any cloud platform, allowing users to customize follow-on implementations with their preferred methods, geographic regions, or variables of interest. In this presentation we will demo the web tool and datasets and offer recommendations about ways to conduct large scale open source climate impacts work.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the main physical laws proposed in landscape evolution models (LEMs). It discusses first the main partial differential equations involved in these models and their variants. These equations govern water runoff, stream incision, regolith{\textendash}bedrock interaction, hillslope evolution, and sedimentation. A synthesis of existing LEMs is proposed. It proposes three models with growing complexity and with a growing number of components: two-equation models with only two components, governing water and bedrock evolution; three-equation models with three components where water, bedrock, and sediment interact; and finally models with four equations and four interacting components, namely water, bedrock, suspended sediment, and regolith. This analysis is not a mere compilation of existing LEMs. It attempts at giving the simplest and most general physically consistent set of equations, coping with all requirements stated in LEMs and LEM software. Three issues are in particular addressed and hopefully resolved. The first one is a correct formulation of the water transport equation down slopes. A general formulation for this equation is proposed, coping not only with the simplest form computing the drainage area but also with a sound energy dissipation argument associated with the Saint-Venant shallow water equations. The second issue arises from the coexistence of two competing modes, namely the detachment-limited erosion mode on hillslopes, and the transport-limited sediment transport on river beds. The third issue (linked to the second) is the fact that no conservation law is available for material in these two modes. A simple solution proposed to resolve these issues is the introduction, as suggested by several authors, of an additional variable for suspended sediment load in water. With only three variables and three equations, the above-mentioned contradictions seem to be eliminated. Several numerical experiments on real digital elevation models (DEMs) illustrate the discussion and show results of landscape evolution with the proposed synthetic models.},

  abstract = {Seasonal snow cover on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is a sensitive indicator of climate change. Unlike the decreasing snow cover extent and associated weakening of radiative cooling effects for the Northern Hemisphere during recent decades reported by previous studies, snow cover variability over the TP and its impact on the energy budget remain largely unknown. We defined the snow cover-induced radiative forcing (SnRF) as the instantaneous perturbation to Earth's shortwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) induced by the presence of snow cover. Here using satellite observations and a radiative kernel approach, we found slightly enhanced SnRF, i.e., a radiative cooling effect on the TP during the past three decades (1982{\textendash}2014). However, this cooling effect weakened during 2001{\textendash}2014 because of reduced snow cover at a rate of -0.61\% decade-1 and land surface albedo at a rate of -0.72\% decade-1. Changes in snow cover fraction are highly correlated with anomalies in land surface albedo (as) over the TP both spatially and temporally. Moreover, the SnRF is closely related to the direct observation of TOA shortwave flux anomalies (R2 = 0.54, p = 0.004) over the TP during 2001{\textendash}2014. Despite the insignificant interannual variability in SnRF, its intra-annual variability has intensified driven mostly by enhanced SnRF during the snow accumulation season but weakened SnRF during the melt season, indicating greater energy release during the transition between accumulation and melt seasons. This may pose a great challenge to snow meltwater use and flood prediction for transboundary rivers originating from the TP, such as the Brahmaputra River basin.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Accurate estimates of regional ice thickness, which are generally produced by ice-thickness inversion models, are crucial for assessments of available freshwater resources and sea level rise. A digital elevation model~(DEM) derived from surface topography of glaciers is a primary data source for such models. However, the scarce in situ measurements of glacier surface elevation limit the evaluation of DEM uncertainty. Hence the influence of DEM uncertainty on ice-thickness modeling remains unclear over the glacierized area of the Tibetan Plateau~(TP). Here, we examine the performance of six widely used and mainly global-scale DEMs: AW3D30 (ALOS {\textendash} Advanced Land Observing Satellite {\textendash} World 3D {\textendash} 30\,m; 30\,m), SRTM-GL1 (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Global 1~arc~second; 30\,m), NASADEM (NASA Digital Elevation Model; 30\,m), TanDEM-X (TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement, synthetic-aperture radar; 90\,m), SRTM~v4.1 (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission; 90\,m), and MERIT (Multi-Error-Removed Improved-Terrain; 90\,m) over the glacierized~TP by comparison with ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite) laser altimetry data while considering the effects of glacier dynamics, terrain factors, and DEM misregistration. The results reveal NASADEM to be the best performer in vertical accuracy, with a small mean error~(ME) of 0.9\,m and a root mean squared error~(RMSE) of 12.6\,m, followed by AW3D30 (2.6\,m~ME and 11.3\,m~RMSE). TanDEM-X also performs well (0.1\,m~ME and 15.1\,m~RMSE) but suffers from serious errors and outliers on steep slopes. SRTM-based DEMs (SRTM-GL1, SRTM~v4.1, and MERIT) (13.5{\textendash}17.0\,m~RMSE) had an inferior performance to NASADEM. Errors in the six DEMs increase from the south-facing to the north-facing aspect and become larger with increasing slope. Misregistration of the six DEMs relative to the ICESat-2 footprint in most glacier areas is small (less than one grid spacing). In a next step, the influence of six DEMs on four ice-thickness inversion models {\textendash} GlabTop2 (Glacier bed Topography), Open Global Glacier Model~(OGGM), Huss{\textendash}Farinotti~(HF), and Ice Thickness Inversion Based on Velocity~(ITIBOV) {\textendash} is intercompared. The results show that GlabTop2 is sensitive to the accuracy of both elevation and slope, while OGGM and HF~are less sensitive to DEM quality and resolution, and ITIBOV is the most sensitive to slope accuracy. NASADEM is the best choice for ice-thickness estimates over the whole~TP.},

However, downscaling of temporal sequences, extremes in daily precipitation, and handling of nonstationary precipitation in future conditions are considered common challenges for most statistical downscaling methods. This study reviewed the above key challenges in statistical downscaling and proposed potential solutions. Ten weather stations located across the globe were used as proof of concept. The use of a stochastic Markov chain to generate daily precipitation occurrences is an effective approach to simulate the temporal sequence of precipitation. Also, the downscaling of precipitation extremes can be achieved by adjusting the skewness coefficient of a probability distribution, as they are highly correlated. Nonstationarity in precipitation downscaling can be handled by adjusting parameters of a probability distribution according to future precipitation change signals projected by climate models. The perspectives proposed in this study are of great significance in using climate model outputs for assessing local and site-specific climate change impacts, especially on future food security.},

  abstract = {Water bodies impounded by glaciers, moraines, and ice jams on rivers can drain suddenly, with disastrous downstream consequences. Lakes can form at the margins of an alpine glacier or ice cap, on its surface, or at its base. Smaller pockets of water may also be present within some glaciers. In all cases, these water bodies might drain by enlarging subglacial tunnels or by mechanical collapse of the glacier dam. Many formerly stable glacier lakes have failed over the past century, in some cases repeatedly, as Earth's atmosphere has warmed and glaciers thinned and receded. The peak discharge, duration, and volume of a subglacial outburst flood depend mainly on (1) the geometry and rate of development of the tunnel at the base of the glacier and (2) the size and geometry of the impounded water body. Discharge commonly increases exponentially during the outburst, but ends quickly when the lake empties or when the drainage tunnel is plugged by collapse of the tunnel roof or closes due to plastic ice flow. Some glacier outburst floods result from the mechanical collapse of the ice dam. In such cases, the peak flow is achieved rapidly during the collapse. Outburst floods from glacier lakes attenuate due to temporary storage of floodwaters in channels and on valley floors.},

  abstract = {[1] This paper evaluates the use of field data on the spatial variability of snow water equivalent (SWE) to guide the design of distributed snow models. An extensive reanalysis of results from previous field studies in different snow environments around the world is presented, followed by an analysis of field data on spatial variability of snow collected in the headwaters of the Jollie River basin, a rugged mountain catchment in the Southern Alps of New Zealand. In addition, area-averaged simulations of SWE based on different types of spatial discretization are evaluated. Spatial variability of SWE is shaped by a range of different processes that occur across a hierarchy of spatial scales. Spatial variability at the watershed-scale is shaped by variability in near-surface meteorological fields (e.g., elevation gradients in temperature) and, provided suitable meteorological data is available, can be explicitly resolved by spatial interpolation/extrapolation. On the other hand, spatial variability of SWE at the hillslope-scale is governed by processes such as drifting, sloughing of snow off steep slopes, trapping of snow by shrubs, and the nonuniform unloading of snow by the forest canopy, which are more difficult to resolve explicitly. Subgrid probability distributions are often capable of representing the aggregate-impact of unresolved processes at the hillslope-scale, though they may not adequately capture the effects of elevation gradients. While the best modeling strategy is case-specific, the analysis in this paper provides guidance on both the suitability of several common snow modeling approaches and on the choice of parameter values in subgrid probability distributions.},

Advances in satellite altimetry have enabled the measurement of sea ice freeboard using satellite microwave altimeters. Unfortunately, validation of these new techniques has suffered from a lack of ground truth measurements. Therefore, an airborne campaign was carried out in March 2006 using laser altimetry and photo imagery to validate sea ice elevation measurements derived from the Envisat/RA-2 microwave altimeter. We present a comparative analysis of Envisat/RA-2 sea ice elevation processing with collocated airborne measurements collected north of the Canadian Archipelago. Consistent overall relationships between block-averaged airborne laser and Envisat elevations are found, over both leads and floes, along the full 1300~km aircraft track. The fine resolution of the airborne laser altimeter data is exploited to evaluate elevation variability within the RA-2 ground footprint. Our analysis shows good agreement between RA-2 derived sea ice elevations and those measured by airborne laser altimetry, particularly over refrozen leads where the overall mean difference is about 1~cm. Notwithstanding this small 1~cm mean difference, we identify a larger elevation uncertainty (of order 10~cm) associated with the uncertain location of dominant radar targets within the particular RA-2 footprint. Sources of measurement uncertainty or ambiguity are identified, and include snow accumulation, tracking noise, and the limited coverage of airborne measurements.},

  abstract = {In recent years, industries such as oil and gas production, waste management, and renewable natural gas/biogas have made a concerted effort to limit and offset anthropogenic sources of methane emissions. However, the state of emissions, what is emitting and at what rate, is highly variable and depends strongly on the micro-scale emissions that have large impacts on the macro-scale aggregates. Bottom-up emissions estimates are better verified using additional independent facility-level measurements, which has led to industry-wide efforts such as the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) push for more accurate measurements. Robust measurement techniques are needed to accurately quantify and mitigate these greenhouse gas emissions. Deployed on both fixed-wing and multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), a miniature tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) sensor has accurately quantified methane emissions from oil and gas assets all over the world since 2017. To compare bottom-up and top-down measurements, it is essential that both values are accompanied with a defensible estimate of measurement uncertainty. In this study, uncertainty has been determined through controlled release experiments as well as statistically using real field data. Two independent deployment methods for quantifying methane emissions utilizing the in situ TDLAS sensor are introduced: fixed-wing and multi-rotor. The fixed-wing, long-endurance UAV method accurately measured emissions with an absolute percentage difference between emitted and mass flux measurement of less than 16\% and an average error of 6\%, confirming its suitability for offshore applications. For the quadcopter rotary drone surveys, two flight patterns were performed: perimeter polygons and downwind flux planes. Flying perimeter polygons resulted in an absolute error less than 36\% difference and average error of 16.2\%, and downwind flux planes less than 32\% absolute difference and average difference of 24.8\% when flying downwind flux planes. This work demonstrates the applicability of ultra-sensitive miniature spectrometers for industrial methane emission quantification at facility level with many potential applications.},

  abstract = {Daily swath MODIS Terra Collection 6 fractional snow cover (MOD10\_L2) estimates were validated with two-day Landsat TM/ETM + snow-covered area estimates across central Idaho and southwestern Montana, USA. Snow cover maps during spring snowmelt for 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2009 were compared between MODIS Terra and Landsat TM/ETM + using least-squared regression. Strong spatial and temporal map agreement was found between MODIS Terra fractional snow cover and Landsat TM/ETM + snow-covered area, although map disagreement was observed for two validation dates. High-altitude cirrus cloud contamination during low snow conditions as well as late season transient snowfall resulted in map disagreement. MODIS Terra's spatial resolution limits retrieval of thin-patchy snow cover, especially during partially cloudy conditions. Landsat's image acquisition frequency can introduce difficulty when discriminating between transient and resident mountain snow cover. Furthermore, transient snowfall later in the snowmelt season, which is a stochastic accumulation event that does not usually persist beyond the daily timescale, will skew decadal snow-covered area variability if bi-monthly climate data record development is the objective. As a quality control step, ground-based daily snow telemetry snow-water-equivalent measurements can be used to verify transient snowfall events. Users of daily MODIS Terra fractional snow products should be aware that local solar illumination and sensor viewing geometry might influence fractional snow cover estimation in mountainous terrain. Cross-sensor interoperability has been confirmed between MODIS Terra and Landsat TM/ETM + when mapping snow from the visible/infrared spectrum. This relationship is strong and supports operational multi-sensor snow cover mapping, specifically climate data record development to expand cryosphere, climate, and hydrological science applications.

  abstract = {Reliable maps of snow-covered areas at scales of meters to tens of meters, with daily temporal resolution, are essential to understanding snow heterogeneity, melt runoff, energy exchange, and ecological processes. Here we develop a parsimonious downscaling routine that can be applied to fractional snow covered area (fSCA) products from satellite platforms such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) that provide daily {$\sim$}500 m data, to derive higher-resolution snow presence/absence grids. The method uses a composite index combining both the topographic position index (TPI) to represent accumulation effects and the diurnal anisotropic heat (DAH, sun exposure) index to represent ablation effects. The procedure is evaluated and calibrated using airborne-derived high-resolution data sets across the Tuolumne watershed, CA using 11 scenes in 2014 to downscale to 30 m resolution. The average matching F score was 0.83. We then tested our method's transferability in time and space by comparing against the Tuolumne watershed in water years 2013 and 2015, and over an entirely different site, Mt. Rainier, WA in 2009 and 2011, to assess applicability to other topographic and climatic conditions. For application to sites without validation data, we recommend equal weights for the TPI and DAH indices and close TPI neighborhoods (60 and 27 m for downscaling to 30 and 3 m, respectively), which worked well in both our study areas. The method is less effective in forested areas, which still requires site-specific treatment. We demonstrate that the procedure can even be applied to downscale to 3 m resolution, a very fine scale relevant to alpine ecohydrology research.},

The WFDEI dataset had previously been generated by applying the WFD methodology to ERA-Interim. The WFDE5 is provided at 0.5{$\circ$} spatial resolution but has higher temporal resolution (hourly) compared to WFDEI (3-hourly). It also has higher spatial variability since it was generated by aggregation of the higher-resolution ERA5 rather than by interpolation of the lower-resolution ERA-Interim data. Evaluation against meteorological observations at 13 globally distributed FLUXNET2015 sites shows that, on average, WFDE5 has lower mean absolute error and higher correlation than WFDEI for all variables. Bias-adjusted monthly precipitation totals of WFDE5 result in more plausible global hydrological water balance components when analysed in an uncalibrated hydrological model (WaterGAP) than with the use of raw ERA5 data for model forcing.

  abstract = {Train movement dynamics are usually modelled by means of Newton's second law. The resulting dynamic equation can be very precise if the parameters that it depends on are determined accurately. However, these parameters may vary in time and show wide variations, making the calibration task nontrivial and jeopardizing the performance of a broad variety of applications in the railway industry: from timetable planning and railway traffic simulation to Driver Advisory Systems and Automatic Train Operation. In this article, the online train motion model calibration problem is addressed with a special focus on energy-efficient on-board applications. To this end, location and speed measurements are assumed to be available for a train running under normal operation conditions. A well-known real-time parameter estimation algorithm, the Unscented Kalman Filter, is combined with a driving regime calculator and a post-processing module in order to obtain bounds and statistics of parameters such as the maximum applied tractive effort and power, the applied brake rates, the cruise speed and the length of the final coasting and braking. The proposed framework is tested in a case study with real data from trains operating on the Eindhoven-'s-Hertogenbosch corridor in the Netherlands. Results obtained show that UKF is able to track the speed and location measurements and to estimate the parameters that model the running resistance in the dynamic equation. The proposed driving regime and the post-processing modules can determine the current regime accurately and give a deeper insight into the variations of the driving style, respectively.},

Recently, it has been shown that this snow distribution can be explained by considering high-resolution flow fields created by numerical flow models. It has also been shown that small{\textendash}scale deposition features are mainly caused by saltation and snow redistribution, larger-scale inhomogeneities are caused by preferential deposition, and the total deposition patterns correlate well with the mean wind speeds. On the basis of the strong correlation between wind fields and snow depth, we develop a new empirical parameterization of preferential deposition of precipitation, which is only governed by the mean flow field. The parameterization is based on case studies, where the physically based model for wind-induced snow transport ALPINE3D was combined with wind fields from the regional atmospheric model ARPS (Advanced Regional Prediction System). The parameterization, along with ARPS wind fields and a distributed energy balance snowmelt model, is used to simulate the 2006/2007 accumulation season over the catchment of Haut Glacier d'Arolla, a glacierized Alpine basin. The results were validated with a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-derived fully distributed high-resolution dataset of snow depth and show that the developed parameterization, despite being simple, is able to largely reduce the difference between modelled and measured snow depth and is suitable for application in glacier mass balance models.

  journal = {Sciences in Cold and Arid Regions},
  abstract = {Satellite remote sensing is widely used to estimate snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) which are two key parameters in global and regional climatic and hydrological systems. Remote sensing techniques for snow depth mainly include passive microwave remote sensing, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Interferometric SAR (InSAR) and Lidar. Among them, passive microwave remote sensing is the most efficient way to estimate large scale snow depth due to its long time series data and high temporal frequency. Passive microwave remote sensing was utilized to monitor snow depth starting in 1978 when Nimbus-7 satellite with Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) freely provided multi-frequency passive microwave data. SAR was found to have ability to detecting snow depth in 1980s, but was not used for satellite active microwave remote sensing until 2000. Satellite Lidar was utilized to detect snow depth since the later period of 2000s. The estimation of snow depth from space has experienced significant progress during the last 40 years. However, challenges or uncertainties still exist for snow depth estimation from space. In this study, we review the main space remote sensing techniques of snow depth retrieval. Typical algorithms and their principles are described, and problems or disadvantages of these algorithms are discussed. It was found that snow depth retrieval in mountainous area is a big challenge for satellite remote sensing due to complicated topography. With increasing number of freely available SAR data, future new methods combing passive and active microwave remote sensing are needed for improving the retrieval accuracy of snow depth in mountainous areas.},

When an OBN monitor was acquired, this allowed us to directly compare the optimum OBN-on-OBC 4D to an OBN-on-streamer, or `mixed acquisition' 4D. NRMS of the benchmark OBN-on-OBC result was 0.18. To understand the impact of the rich azimuth coverage of OBC data, a decimation trial was carried out, limiting the OBN-on-OBC processing to narrow azimuths similar to the NATS survey. The resulting 4D difference was interpretable, but had elevated noise levels, with NRMS of 0.38. Comparing this narrow azimuth OBC result to 4D using the NATS baseline gives us the impact of the acquisition system, particularly the receiver datum. While there were some similarities in the location of hardening signals, the NATS 4D was too noisy to reliably interpret, with NRMS of 0.58. It is thought that one of the main causes of this may be non-repeatable peg-leg multiples. We conclude that for Kinnoull, and similar North Sea fields, OBN-on-NATS 4D is not currently possible, so to successfully transition from towed streamer to ocean bottom seismic 4D will require a transition vintage where both types of data are acquired simultaneously},

This article describes the forecast model, data assimilation method, and input datasets used to produce ERA-Interim, and discusses the performance of the system. Special emphasis is placed on various difficulties encountered in the production of ERA-40, including the representation of the hydrological cycle, the quality of the stratospheric circulation, and the consistency in time of the reanalysed fields.

Global reanalyses of the atmosphere, ocean, land surface, and atmospheric composition have played an important role in improving and extending the capabilities of ECMWF's operational forecasting systems. The potential role of reanalysis in support of climate change services in Europe is driving several interesting new developments. These include the production of reanalyses that span a century or more and the implementation of a coupled data assimilation capability suitable for climate reanalysis.

  abstract = {Laser altimetry (lidar) is a remote-sensing technology that holds tremendous promise for mapping snow depth in snow hydrology and avalanche applications. Recently lidar has seen a dramatic widening of applications in the natural sciences, resulting in technological improvements and an increase in the availability of both airborne and ground-based sensors. Modern sensors allow mapping of vegetation heights and snow or ground surface elevations below forest canopies. Typical vertical accuracies for airborne datasets are decimeter-scale with order 1 m point spacings. Ground-based systems typically provide millimeter-scale range accuracy and sub-meter point spacing over 1 m to several kilometers. Many system parameters, such as scan angle, pulse rate and shot geometry relative to terrain gradients, require specification to achieve specific point coverage densities in forested and/or complex terrain. Additionally, snow has a significant volumetric scattering component, requiring different considerations for error estimation than for other Earth surface materials. We use published estimates of light penetration depth by wavelength to estimate radiative transfer error contributions. This paper presents a review of lidar mapping procedures and error sources, potential errors unique to snow surface remote sensing in the near-infrared and visible wavelengths, and recommendations for projects using lidar for snow-depth mapping.},

In this study, we generate five new DEMs of the Mont-Blanc area from TanDEM-X interferometric pairs acquired in 2012/2013. We conducted a multitemporal analysis of the DEMs in comparison with two high-resolution DEMs obtained from Pl{\'e}iades stereo satellite images in 2012 and 2013. A vertical precision of 1-3 m of the radar DEMs is estimated over ice and snow free areas and slopes less than 40{$^\circ$}. DEM-derived elevation changes are compared with outputs of the snowpack model Crocus and snow accumulation measurements. The results show that at altitudes below 2500-m a.s.l., the radar penetration is negligible in our study area. The DEM-derived elevation changes agree, within uncertainty, with the modeled and field snow height. At higher altitudes, the comparison between the radar and optical DEMs acquired only a few weeks apart allows estimating the interferometric bias of the X-band DEM in the dry snowpack. At 4000-m a.s.l, it reaches 4 m on average in October and February. A geodetic glacier mass balance calculated using the October radar DEM would be biased. For the least favorable case, the highly elevated Bossons glacier, the bias would correspond to 1.66-m w.e. This error is too large to derive significant annual mass balances, but similar to elevation or seasonality uncertainties if integrated over a 10-years period.},

This review examines the state of understanding of the responses of mid-latitude alpine landscapes to recent cryospheric change and summarizes the variety and complexity of documented landscape responses involving glaciers, moraines, rock and debris slopes, and rock glaciers. These indicate how a common general forcing translates into varied site-specific slope responses according to material structures and properties, thermal and hydrological environments, process rates, and prior slope histories. Warming of permafrost in rock and debris slopes has demonstrably increased instability, manifest as rock glacier acceleration, rockfalls, debris flows, and related phenomena. Changes in glacier geometry influence stress fields in rock and debris slopes, and some failures appear to be accelerating toward catastrophic failure. Several sites now require expensive monitoring and modeling to design effective risk-reduction strategies, especially where new lakes form and multiply hazard potential, and new activities and infrastructure are developed.},

We simulated a regional wide-azimuth (WAZ) streamer survey with offsets of {$\pm$}8 km inline and {$\pm$}4 km crossline over this model. Using the true velocity model, reverse time migration of this data set produced a usable subsalt image nearly everywhere. The same synthetic seismic data set was passed to interpreters and geophysicists to process and image as if it were real field data. They did not get to see the true velocity model. Instead they performed conventional ``migrate, pick, and flood'' top-down velocity-model building, followed by final imaging through their interpreted velocity model. Where the salt was relatively simple, we found that the interpreted velocity model was reasonably accurate. Reverse time migration of the seismic data through these parts of the velocity model produced an image that was imperfect, but still usable for exploration-scale, structural interpretation. Where the salt structure was complex, however, it was sometimes grossly misinterpreted. The ensuing large-scale errors in the interpreted velocity model resulted in an unusable, shattered subsalt image. We next simulated a low-frequency, ocean-bottom-node (OBN) acquisition, with offsets up to 30 km in all azimuths. We started with the imperfect model produced by the interpreters and investigated what it would take for fullwaveform inversion (FWI) to successfully find and fix the gross interpretation errors. Initial results suggest this ``interpretation followed by FWI'' methodology could produce a velocity model capable of generating an adequate subsalt image, but it may require ultrawide offsets (30 km), ultralow frequencies (below 2 Hz), and improved FWI algorithms to do so.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Accurate knowledge of snow depth distributions in mountain catchments is critical for applications in hydrology and ecology. Recently, a method was proposed to map snow depth at meter-scale resolution from very-high-resolution stereo satellite imagery (e.g., Pl{\'e}iades) with an accuracy close to 0.5\&thinsp;m. However, the validation was limited to probe measurements and unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry, which sampled a limited fraction of the topographic and snow depth variability. We improve upon this evaluation using accurate maps of the snow depth derived from Airborne Snow Observatory laser-scanning measurements in the Tuolumne river basin, USA. We find a good agreement between both datasets over a snow-covered area of 138\&thinsp;km\textsuperscript{2} on a 3\&thinsp;m grid, with a positive bias for a Pl{\'e}iades snow depth of 0.08\&thinsp;m, a root mean square error of 0.80\&thinsp;m and a normalized median absolute deviation (NMAD) of 0.69\&thinsp;m. Satellite data capture the relationship between snow depth and elevation at the catchment scale and also small-scale features like snow drifts and avalanche deposits at a typical scale of tens of meters. The random error at the pixel level is lower in snow-free areas than in snow-covered areas, but it is reduced by a factor of 2 (NMAD of approximately 0.40\&thinsp;m for snow depth) when averaged to a 36\&thinsp;m grid. We conclude that satellite photogrammetry stands out as a convenient method to estimate the spatial distribution of snow depth in high mountain catchments.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The unprecedented precision of satellite laser altimetry data from the NASA ICESat-2 mission and the increasing availability of high-resolution elevation datasets open new opportunities to measure snow depth in mountains, a critical variable for ecosystem and water resource monitoring. We retrieved snow depth over the upper Tuolumne basin (California, USA) for 3 years by differencing ICESat-2 ATL06 snow-on elevations and various snow-off digital elevation models. Snow depth derived from ATL06 data only (snow-on and snow-off) offers a poor temporal and spatial coverage, limiting its potential utility. However, using a digital terrain model from airborne lidar surveys as the snow-off elevation source yielded a snow depth accuracy of {$\sim$} 0.2 m (bias) and precision of {$\sim$} 1 m (random error) across the basin, with an improved precision of 0.5 m for low slopes (\&lt; 10{$\circ$}), compared to eight reference airborne lidar snow depth maps. Snow depths derived from ICESat-2 ATL06 and a satellite photogrammetry digital elevation model have a larger bias and reduced precision, partly induced by increased errors in forested areas. These various combinations of repeated ICESat-2 snow surface elevation measurements with satellite or airborne products will enable tailored approaches to map snow depth and estimate water resource availability in mountainous areas with limited snow depth observations.},

  abstract = {Accurate knowledge of snow depth distributions in forested regions is crucial for applications in hydrology and ecology. In such a context, understanding and assessing the effect of vegetation and topographic conditions on snow depth variability is required. In this study, the spatial distribution of snow depth in two agro-forested sites and one coniferous site in eastern Canada was analyzed for topographic and vegetation effects on snow accumulation. Spatially distributed snow depths were derived by unmanned aerial vehicle light detection and ranging (UAV lidar) surveys conducted in 2019 and 2020. Distinct patterns of snow accumulation and erosion in open areas (fields) versus adjacent forested areas were observed in lidar-derived snow depth maps at all sites. Omnidirectional semi-variogram analysis of snow depths showed the existence of a scale break distance of less than 10 m in the forested area at all three sites, whereas open areas showed comparatively larger scale break distances (i.e., 11{\textendash}14 m). The effect of vegetation and topographic variables on the spatial variability in snow depths at each site was investigated with random forest models. Results show that the underlying topography and the wind redistribution of snow along forest edges govern the snow depth variability at agro-forested sites, while forest structure variability dominates snow depth variability in the coniferous environment. These results highlight the importance of including and better representing these processes in physically based models for accurate estimates of snowpack dynamics.},

The new source setup is a continued development from the relatively new triple source design, but now taken a step further. The Barents Sea, more specifically the Loppa High area is a relatively shallow water environment. Due to late uplift and erosion, the shallow geologic setting experiences very high seismic velocities. This effectively reduced the amount of rays that is used to image the subsurface from each source fired. It is therefore desirable to use more sources than conventionally deployed. During a large triple-source survey across the Loppa High last year {\textendash} a subset of lines were re-acquired with a hexasource wide tow setup. Each of the single string hexa-sources was based on a dual-string triple source 1725in3 setup, with a slight modification to optimize the peak-to-bubble ratio and directivity. By reducing the amount of air-guns per source down from 15 to 7 we were able to achieve a compact more point like source output as well as distribute the source lines evenly and wide.},

  abstract = {Seismic imaging in the Barents Sea, north of Norway, has long been a challenging task. The water depth is relatively shallow at {\textasciitilde}350m. In addition, the water bottom is very hard and with rugose glacial ice plough marks. Recent Tertiary uplift and erosion has brought high velocity rocks close to the seafloor (above 3000m/s in less than 1s TWT). This type of geologic setting sets up a complex pattern of multiples with strong diffractions. Considering that several recent new discoveries (Gohta, Alta, Neiden \& Wisting) are all relatively shallow (1500, 1400, 1100 \& 750m), this poses a tricky seismic acquisition and processing challenge. After several rounds of re-processing efforts using legacy data, Lundin quickly realized that very near offsets and high spatial and temporal sampling was missing in most standard 3D marine datasets. The solution was a new unique dual-vessel source-over-cable acquisition method. Instead of towing two dual-sources {\textasciitilde}250m in front of 1014 cables, the new concept uses three compact wide-tow sources, towed from a separate vessel in the middle of the seismic spread. This addresses a multitude of the challenges; Negative- zero- and positive-offsets (splitspread shot gathers) are all recorded. Triple-wide-tow sources with only 3.6s shot interval maintain very high fold in addition to bringing zero- and full azimuth near-offsets. With this new acquisition configuration {\textasciitilde}2000 km2 of high density (6.26 x 8.33m), high fold data (120 fold for only +/3km offset) has been acquired across the Gohta, Alta and Filicudi areas. The new data eases the demultiple problem with its incredible high resolution multiple models as well as addresses the lack of fold for shallow targets, normally an impossible task for the legacy data. This paper presents the geologic challenge, the proposed solutions, the acquisition method and finally the processing and imaging of this new source-over-cable marine seismic data.},

  abstract = {This paper present the first ever large scale commercial hexasource wide tow marine acquisition survey. The survey was acquired with a source-over-cable setup, utilizing a streamer vessel in the front, trailed by a source vessel midway down the streamers, towing the 6 wide-tow small compact sources. This setup allows for dense even source-line spacing of {\textasciitilde}55m as well as providing split-spread full azimuth seismic shot gathers. The resulting data has a native spatial sampling of only 5 x 6.25m. Compared to conventional seismic data, the fold exceeds an order of magnitude higher, despite maintaining a vessel sail-line separation of approximately 350m. Initial brute stack migrations of the shallow part of the new data already exceeds the image quality of any of the legacy datasets in this area. Further processing, including deblending and demultiple will enhance the quality deeper down and also improve the signal-to-noise ratio.},

  abstract = {Summary This paper presents a new seismic acquisition method designed and optimized to acquire very high-resolution towed marine seismic data across PL965 and PL962 in the Barents Sea. Fairly recent legacy 3D seismic existed in the area, however the acquisition parameters were not optimized for the shallow reservoir targets in the region. The new acquisition method was specifically designed to acquire close to zero-offset traces as well as obtaining very high spatial sampling of the subsurface. This was achieved by utilizing four single string, short, focused sources, towed wide, to keep the offsets to the outer streamer as low as possible. In addition to the novel source setup, the acquisition utilized six multi-measurement streamers towed flat and deep to reduce noise levels and allow for deghosting of the receiver wavefield. A key goal of the acquisition was to be able to extract wide angle ranges for accurate AVO analysis. By redesigning the source arrays, we achieved less than 20m near-offset and by towing 2km long streamers we have been able to capture angles of 0 to 45 degrees across all target levels.},

  abstract = {The use of satellite remote sensing for the mapping of snow-cover characteristics has a long-lasting history reaching back until the 1960s. Because snow cover plays an important role in the Earth's climate system, it is necessary to map snow-cover extent and snow mass in both high temporal and high spatial resolutions. This task can only be achieved by the use of remotely sensed data. Many different sensors have been used in the past decades with various algorithms and respective accuracies. This article provides an overview of the most common methods. The limitations, advantages and drawbacks will be illustrated while error sources and strategies on how to ease their impact will be reviewed. Beginning with a short summary of the physical and spectral properties of snow, methods to map snow extent from the reflective part of the spectrum, algorithms to estimate snow water equivalent (SWE) from passive microwave (PM) data and the combination of both spectra will be delineated. At the end, the reader should have an overarching overview of what is currently possible and the difficulties that can occur in the context of snow-cover mapping from the reflective and microwave parts of the spectrum.},

In this Review, we describe the spatio-temporal distribution and geodynamic mechanisms of surface uplift in the Tibetan Plateau, based on geologic and palaeo-a ltimetric constraints. Localized mountain building was initiated during a Cretaceous microcontinent collision event in central Tibet and ocean{\textendash}continent convergence in southern Tibet. Geological data indicate that India began colliding with Asian-affinity rocks 65{\textendash}60\,million years ago (Ma). High-elevation ({$>$}4\,km) east{\textendash}west mountain belts were established in southern and central Tibet by {\textasciitilde}55\,Ma and {\textasciitilde}45\,Ma, respectively. These mountain belts were separated by {$\leq$}2\,km elevation basins centred on the microcontinent suture in central Tibet, until the basins were uplifted further between {\textasciitilde}38 and 29\,Ma. Basin uplift to {$\geq$}4\,km elevation was delayed along the India{\textendash}Asia suture zone until {\textasciitilde}20\,Ma, along with that in northern Tibet. Delamination and break-o ff of the subducted Indian and Asian lithosphere were the dominant mechanisms of surface uplift, with spatial variations controlled by inherited lithospheric heterogeneities. Future research should explore why surface uplift along suture zones {\textemdash} the loci of the initial collision {\textemdash} was substantially delayed compared with the time of initial collision.},

These shrubs are thought to have a warming effect on permafrost by increasing snowpack thermal insulation, thereby limiting winter cooling and accelerating thaw. Here, we use ground temperature observations and heat transfer simulations to show that low shrubs can actually cool the ground in winter by providing a thermal bridge through the snowpack. Observations from unmanipulated herb tundra and shrub tundra sites on Bylot Island in the Canadian high Arctic reveal a 1.21\,{$^\circ$}C cooling effect between November and February. This is despite a snowpack that is twice as insulating in shrubs. The thermal bridging effect is reversed in spring when shrub branches absorb solar radiation and transfer heat to the ground. The overall thermal effect is likely to depend on snow and shrub characteristics and terrain aspect. The inclusion of these thermal bridging processes into climate models may have an important impact on projected greenhouse gas emissions by permafrost.},

Several methods can estimate the amount of snow throughout a mountain range: (1) Spatial interpolation from surface sensors constrained by remotely sensed snow extent provides a consistent answer, with uncertainty related to extrapolation to unrepresented locations. (2) The remotely sensed date of disappearance of snow is combined with a melt calculation to reconstruct the SWE back to the last significant snowfall. (3) Passive microwave sensors offer real-time global SWE estimates but suffer from several problems like subpixel variability in the mountains. (4) A numerical model combined with assimilated surface observations produces SWE at 1-km resolution at continental scales, but depends heavily on a surface network. (5) New methods continue to be explored, for example, airborne LiDAR altimetry provides direct measurements of snow depth, which are combined with modelled snow density to estimate SWE. While the problem is aggressively addressed, the right answer remains elusive. Good characterization of the snow is necessary to make informed choices about water resources and adaptation to climate change and variability.

  abstract = {The Troll Field in the Norwegian North Sea is one of the largest offshore gas fields in the world. Its western part contains a thin but exploitable oil leg (11{\textendash}26 m) below the thick gas column, with the majority of the oil located in the late Jurassic Sognefjord Formation. The reservoir geology of the Troll Field was discussed in a few papers prior to production start-up in 1995, but a comprehensive account of the geological model of the Late Callovian {\textendash} Late Oxfordian Sognefjord Formation has not as yet been published. The present paper reviews the depositional setting and architecture of this reservoir unit based on integration of results from disciplines such as sedimentology, seismic data analysis and stratigraphy. The Troll West reservoir formed on the edge of the Horda Platform during the Late Jurassic rift event; it consists of numerous stacked and generally offlapping sandstone units with intervening finer-grained deposits. The reservoir succession contains three composite sequences, of which the lower two belong to the Sognefjord Formation and the upper one is part of the Draupne Formation. Within this framework, five basic sequences and fifteen reservoir zones occur at the systems tract scale. The lower to middle parts of the studied succession reflect southwestwards growth and decay of a coastal spit system flanked to the east by a tidal backbasin. Brackish water facies have been identified in the eastern parts of the field through the use of detailed palynology. The extensive well database (including 15 cored production wells) and the high quality of the seismic data in the Troll area provide a unique opportunity to gain insight into the evolution of such a major spit-backbasin to tide-dominated deltaic system. A typical spit/strandplain progradation episode results in a clinoform succession comprising bioturbated sands of offshore transition origin overlain by lower shoreface sandstones which pass upward into clean, generally coarser-grained sands of upper shoreface and foreshore origin. The bases of such regressive sandbodies are often sharp, due to rapid facies translations during forced regression, but they may also be characterized by up to 40 m thick coarsening-upwards successions containing alternating siltstones and sandy event-beds generated by storm winnowing of the spit platform. Eastwards, these shallow-marine sandstone units finger into heterogeneous coastal plain deposits. On seismic data, this lateral transition is portrayed by the change from clinoform units in the west to undulatory seismic patterns in the east, as seen on maps based on classification of trace shape. A change in coastal morphology from wave- to tide-dominated took place in the Troll West area in the Late Oxfordian, perhaps related to an increase in tidal range. In the tidal facies tract, heterolithic inshore deposits formed in tidal channels and flats are replaced, in a seaward direction, by more sand-dominated high-energy tidal deposits such as mouth-bars and sand-ridge complexes. Further seawards, muddy shelf or prodelta deposits similar to those found in the wave-dominated facies tract are seen. In the Kimmeridgian, relative sea-level rise and eastward tilting of the Horda Platform caused reworking of the upper part of the Sognefjord Formation and localized hanging-wall shoreline sands formed as the uppermost reservoir intervals on Troll West.},

The temperature of most lakes in the dry climate zone and in the equatorial climatic zone varied from 17 to 31 C and from 23 to 27 C, respectively. LSWTs in the warm temperate and cold climatic zones were in the range of 20 to 27 C and -0.6 and 17 C, respectively. The average day time LSWT in the polar climate zone was -0.71 C in the summer. Lakes in high latitude and in the Tibetan Plateau displayed low LSWT, ranging from -11 to 26 C during the night time. Large spatial variations of diurnal temperature difference (DTD) were observed in lakes across Eurasia. However, variations in DTDs were small in lakes located in high latitude and in tropical rainforest regions. The shallow lakes showed a rapid response of LSWT to solar and atmospheric forcing, while in the large and deep lakes, that response was sluggish. Results of this study demonstrated the applicability of remote sensing and MODIS LST products to capture the spatial{\textendash}temporal variability of LSWT across continental scales, in particular for the vast wilderness areas and protected environment in high latitude regions of the world. The approach can be used in future studies examining processes and factors controlling large scale variability of LSWT.},

In this study we used a new downscaling{\textendash}calibration procedure of the freely accessible Version 7 of TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) 3B43 product, in conjunction with limited rain gauge data sets, to generate improved monthly pixel-based precipitation data at higher spatial resolution (1km). The spatial downscaling from 0.25{$^\circ$} to 1km grids was achieved by using site-specific non-linear relationships between annual precipitation and annually averaged NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). The calibration was based on Geograhical Difference Analysis (GDA) and Geographical Ratio Analysis (GRA). The new integrated procedure was tested for Lake Tana Basin (LTB) in Ethiopia with a humid climate (rainfall 1395 mm/yr during 1998{\textendash}2004) and for the Caspian Sea Region (CSR) in Iran with a semi-arid climate (rainfall 442 mm/yr during 1999{\textendash}2003). The best 1km annual precipitation data were achieved through downscaling followed by GDA calibration for most cases. The monthly fractions derived from the un-calibrated TRMM 3B43 product can be used to disaggregate 1km annual precipitation to 1km monthly precipitation. The disaggregated 1km monthly precipitation has not only significant improvement in the spatial resolution, but also good agreements with rain gauge data were achieved for both LTB (R2=0.87, RMSE=56mm, MAE=32mm and Bias=0.01) and the CSR (R2=0.79, RMSE=23mm, MAE=16mm and Bias=0.14). A similar calibration procedure using rain gauges at monthly time scale did not improve the level of performance.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new method for simultaneous source deblending developed in the context of spatial coherency preservation. The deblending is formulated as an inverse problem which is solved in local overlapping windows extracted from the blended data. To constrain the solution, the unknown sources are assumed to be quasipredictive in the spatial domains. During the signal estimation, this will promote tolerance on impulsive blending noise and provide flexibility and robustness in coherency preservation depending upon the signal to noise ratio at a given frequency or within a given window. The proposed method is generic and can be applied to all configurations of simultaneous source acquisition and can deal with an arbitrary number of sources. Tests on numerically blended real towed streamer marine data show good deblending results with an excellent compromise between signal preservation and cross-talk contamination across a wide frequency range, particularly towards the low end. The proposed method is robust and flexible and can be applied in the early stages of a typical marine seismic processing sequence.},

  abstract = {Predicting wind flow in highly complex terrain like the Alps is a challenge for all models. When physical processes need to be resolved in a spatially explicit manner, grids with high horizontal resolution of a few hundred meters are often required and drastically limit, in many cases, the extent and duration of the simulations. Many surface process models, like the simulation of heterogeneous snow cover across a season, however, need long time series on large domains as inputs. Statistical downscaling can provide the required data, but no model can reach the desired resolutions effectively and provide temporally resolved wind speed and direction on highly complex topography. The assessment of the potential for wind energy in the Alps, a promising player in the energy transition, is an example where the current shortcomings cause strong limitations. We present ``Wind-Topo'', a novel approach based on deep learning that discovers some of the interactions between high-resolution topography and coarser-resolution states of the atmosphere to generate near-surface wind fields with a 50-m resolution. In our test case, we use a large number of measurement stations in Switzerland to train the model and an operational weather prediction model (COSMO-1) as predictor. Wind-Topo employs a custom architecture that analyses the state of the atmosphere on various scales and associates it with high-resolution topography. A dedicated loss function leads to good scoring metrics as well as accurate wind-speed distributions at 60 independent stations used for a thorough validation. 50-m resolution wind fields are generated efficiently and exhibit several expected orographic effects like ridge acceleration, sheltering, and deflection. Furthermore, the bias and mean absolute error from COSMO-1 at the alpine validation stations, which are 0.72 and 1.77\,m{$\cdot$}s-1 respectively, are reduced to -0.07 and 1.21\,m{$\cdot$}s-1. Gridded statistical downscaling for wind fields in highly complex terrain is an unsolved problem. Wind-Topo, a new model based on deep learning, improves high-resolution wind-field modelling using coarser-resolution flow solvers and high-resolution topography. From 261 measurement stations in diverse terrain, the model identifies general rules of the wind/topography interactions that can successfully be applied to new locations, thus allowing the generation of gridded outputs. Computational effort is low compared with modelling the flow numerically at this high resolution.},

In complex terrain, the coupled model reproduces the measured vertical profiles of horizontal wind speed better than the standalone microscale model or the mesoscale model. The coupled model also performs better in the horizontal extrapolation of measurements in complex terrain. In simpler terrain, it is beneficial to use the coupled model when the focus is on areas located downstream of even small terrain features. Otherwise, the mesoscale simulations perform as good or better than the coupled model.},

  abstract = {An approach for snow water equivalent (SWE) modelling in tundra environments has been developed for the test area on the Yamal peninsula. Detailed mapping of snow cover is very important for tundra areas under continuous permafrost conditions, because the snow cover affects the active layer thickness (ALT) and the ground temperature, acting as a heat-insulating agent. The information concerning snow cover with specific regime of accumulation can support studies of ground temperature distribution and other permafrost related aspects. Special attention has been given to the presence of shrubs and microtopography, specifically ravines in a modelling approach. The methodology is based on statistical analysis of snow survey data and on GIS- (Geographical Information System) analysis of a range of parameters: topography, wind, and shrub vegetation. The topography significantly controls snow cover redistribution. This influence can be expressed as increase of snow depth on concave and decrease on convex surfaces. Specifically, snow depth was related to curvature in the study area with a correlation of R=0.83. An index is used to distinguish windward and leeward slopes in order to explain wind redistribution of snow. It is calculated from aspect data retrieved from a digital elevation model (obtained by field survey). It can be shown that shrub vegetation can serve as a `trap' for wind-blown snow but is not a limiting factor for maximum snow depth, since the snow depth can be higher or lower than shrub height dependent on other factors.},

Ancient temperatures, measured using oxygen isotopes in the ice, can be accurately dated from annual dust layers in the ice dating back 100,000years. The {$\delta$}18O data clearly show remarkable swings in climate. In the past 500years, Greenland temperatures have fluctuated back and forth between warming and cooling about 40 times, with changes every 25{\textendash}30years. Among the more prominent climate changes recorded in the ice cores are 8500years of Holocene temperatures that were 2{\textendash}5{$^\circ$}F warmer than present; a 8200-year cold period in the early Holocene; the Minoan Warm Period ({$\sim$}3300years ago); the Roman Warm Period (250 BC to 400 AD); the Dark Ages Cold Period ({$\sim$}400{\textendash}900 AD); the Medieval Warm Period (900{\textendash}1300 AD); the Little Ice Age (1300 AD to the 20th century); the Wolf Minimum Cold Period ({$\sim$}1280{\textendash}1350 AD); the Sp{\"o}rer Cold Period (1460{\textendash}1550 AD); the Maunder Minimum Cold Period (1645{\textendash}1710); the Dalton Cold Period (1790{\textendash}1820); the 1880{\textendash}1915 Cold Period; the 1915{\textendash}1945 Warm Period; the 1945{\textendash}1977 Cold Period; and the 1978{\textendash}2000 Warm Period. Comparisons of the intensity and magnitude of past warming and cooling climate changes show that the global warming experienced during the past century pales into insignificance when compared to the magnitude of profound climate reversals over the past 25,000years. At least three warming events were 20{\textendash}24 times the magnitude of warming over the past century, and four were 6{\textendash}9 times the magnitude of warming over the past century. The magnitude of the only modern warming that might possibly have been caused by CO2 (1978{\textendash}2000) is insignificant compared to the earlier periods of warming. Arctic temperatures have fluctuated repeatedly in step with Greenland and global climate changes. Historic records at many weather stations in the Arctic show that temperatures were higher in the 1930s and 1940s than during recent warming (1980{\textendash}2000). Sea ice extent has expanded and contracted with temperature fluctuations and has sharply increased over the past several years.},

  abstract = {Registration or matching process aims to find the misalignment between two or more images concerning the same area to detect the values of the mapping matrix in order to transform interest points in one image to its correspondence in the others. This paper presents a dynamic approach aiming to improve the performance of the registration process for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. First, the noise resulting from the capturing process is reduced by using a smoothing filter based on kernel-gaussian to reduce the amplification of noise. Then; a combination of two area- based matching (ABM) methods is used. The first method is carried out using Crosscorrelation approach, acting as coarse registration step. The second method is achieved by using regular step gradient descent (RSGD) optimizer, acting as fine registration step. Evaluation of the performance concerning the proposed manner is achieved by comparing to the state-of-the art detectors as Harris, Shi-Tomasi, and Features from Accelerated Segment Test (FAST) detectors. Metric factors to achieve the comparison are mean square error (MSE) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) between the input images. Results demonstrate a highly performance for the proposed method compared to the others where it has a high robustness and minimizes the noise of the input image.},

  abstract = {Abstract             There is a need to estimate design floods for areal planning and the design of important infrastructure. A major challenge is the mismatch between the length of the flood records and needed return periods. A majority of flood time series are shorter than 50 years, and the required return periods might be 200, 500, or 1,000 years. Consequently, the estimation uncertainty is large. In this paper, we investigated how the use of historical information might improve design flood estimation. We used annual maximum data from four selected Norwegian catchments, and historical flood information to provide an indication of water levels for the largest floods in the last two to three hundred years. We assessed the added value of using historical information and demonstrated that both reliability and stability improves, especially for short record lengths and long return periods. In this study, we used information on water levels, which showed the stability of river profiles to be a major challenge.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The Glomma River is the largest in Norway, with a catchment area of 154\,450\,km2. People living near the shores of this river are frequently exposed to destructive floods that impair local cities and communities. Unfortunately, design flood predictions are hampered by uncertainty since the standard flood records are much shorter than the requested return period and the climate is also expected to change in the coming decades. Here we combine systematic historical and paleo information in an effort to improve flood frequency analysis and better understand potential linkages to both climate and non-climatic forcing. Specifically, we (i)~compile historical flood data from the existing literature, (ii)~produce high-resolution X-ray fluorescence~(XRF), magnetic susceptibility~(MS), and computed tomography~(CT) scanning data from a sediment core covering the last 10\,300~years, and (iii)~integrate these data sets in order to better estimate design floods and assess non-stationarities. Based on observations from Lake Flyginnsj{\o}en, receiving sediments from Glomma only when it reaches a certain threshold, we can estimate flood frequency in a moving window of 50~years across millennia revealing that past flood frequency is non-stationary on different timescales. We observe that periods with increased flood activity (4000{\textendash}2000~years ago and {$<$}1000~years ago) correspond broadly to intervals with lower than average summer temperatures and glacier growth, whereas intervals with higher than average summer temperatures and receding glaciers overlap with periods of reduced numbers of floods (10\,000~to 4000~years ago and 2200~to 1000~years ago). The flood frequency shows significant non-stationarities within periods with increased flood activity, as was the case for the 18th~century, including the 1789\,CE (``Stor-Ofsen'') flood, the largest on record for the last 10\,300~years at this site. Using the identified non-stationarities in the paleoflood record allowed us to estimate non-stationary design floods. In particular, we found that the design flood was 23\,\% higher during the 18th~century than today and that long-term trends in flood variability are intrinsically linked to the availability of snow in late spring linking climate change to adjustments in flood frequency.},

  abstract = {We model the spatial distribution of snow depth across a wind-dominated alpine basin using a geostatistical approach with a complex variable mean. Snow depth surveys were conducted at maximum accumulation from 1997 through 2003 in the 2.3 km2 Green Lakes Valley watershed in Colorado. We model snow depth as a random function that can be decomposed into a deterministic trend and a stochastic residual. Three snow depth trends were considered, differing in how they model the effect of terrain parameters on snow depth. The terrain parameters considered were elevation, slope, potential radiation, an index of wind sheltering, and an index of wind drifting. When nonlinear interactions between the terrain parameters were included and a multiyear data set was analyzed, all five terrain parameters were found to be statistically significant in predicting snow depth, yet only potential radiation and the index of wind sheltering were found to be statistically significant for all individual years. Of the five terrain parameters considered, the index of wind sheltering was found to have the greatest effect on predicted snow depth. The methodology presented in this paper allows for the characterization of the spatial correlation of model residuals for a variable mean model, incorporates the spatial correlation into the optimization of the deterministic trend, and produces smooth estimate maps that may extrapolate above and below measured values.},

Satellite altimetry calculation results from the combination of two measurements. From a different perspective, "Satellite with Argos and AltiKa" is an innovative radar altimetry mission that utilizes a new Ka-band altimeter concept (AltiKa). The Geodynamic Experimental Ocean Satellite inherited radar technology from the Skylab and provided more accurate altimetric measurements. New altimetry techniques require short-term accuracy characteristics. The mission requirement is thus expressed using a spatial frequency spectrum. While on its path between the satellite and the Earth's surface, the radar signal is impacted by various geophysical phenomena that must be accounted to provide a precise range measurement. In order to reach the expected range measurement accuracy, the effects of the atmosphere on the propagation of the altimeter microwave radar pulse must be accounted for.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The warming and subsequent degradation of mountain permafrost within alpine areas represent an important process influencing the stability of steep slopes and rock faces. The unstable and monitored slopes of Mannen (M{\o}re and Romsdal county, southern Norway) and G{\'a}manjunni-3 (Troms and Finnmark county, northern Norway) were classified as high-risk sites by the Norwegian Geological Survey (NGU). Failure initiation has been suggested to be linked to permafrost degradation, but the detailed permafrost distribution at the sites is unknown. Rock wall (RW) temperature loggers at both sites have measured the thermal regime since 2015, showing mean rock surface temperatures between 2.5 and -1.6\,{$\circ$}C depending on site and topographic aspect. Between 2016 and 2019 we conducted 2D and 3D electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) surveys on the plateau and directly within the rock wall back scarp of the unstable slopes at both sites. In combination with geophysical laboratory analysis of rock wall samples from both sites, the ERT soundings indicate widespread permafrost areas, especially at G{\'a}manjunni-3. Finally, we conducted 2D thermal modelling to evaluate the potential thermal regime, along with an analysis of available displacement rate measurements based on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and ground- and satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) methods. Surface air and ground temperatures have increased significantly since ca. 1900 by 1 and 1.5\,{$\circ$}C, and the highest temperatures have been measured and modelled since 2000 at both study sites. We observed a seasonality of displacement, with increasing velocities during late winter and early spring and the highest velocities in June, probably related to water pressure variations during snowmelt. The displacement rates of G{\'a}manjunni-3 rockslide co-vary with subsurface resistivity and modelled ground temperature. Increased displacement rates seem to be associated with sub-zero ground temperatures and higher ground resistivity. This might be related to the presence of ground ice in fractures and pores close to the melting point, facilitating increased deformation. The study demonstrates and discusses the possible influence of permafrost, at least locally, on the dynamics of large rock slope instabilities.},

  abstract = {Catastrophic mass flows (CMF) in the mountain cryosphere are an important geomorphic process that may pose significant hazard to communities and infrastructure in cold mountains; they occur in association with snow, glaciers, and permafrost in environments that are particularly sensitive to changes in thermal regimes and heavy rainfall. CMF form a broad range of cryospheric hazards and include mass movements of glacial ice, rock avalanches, ice-rock avalanches, debris flows, and outburst-generated flows. In some high mountains, avalanches of glacial ice, rock, and ice-rock mixtures may be earthquake-triggered. Broadly, CMF in the mountain cryosphere are characterized by sudden onset, high mean velocity (!5 m/s), and high mobility (i.e., long runout in relation to volume) and generally involve a mixture of earth materials, water, snow, and ice. In some cases, CMF runout may exceed 100 km from source. CMF commonly undergo dramatic process transformation during movement in response to melting of entrained ice and snow, entrainment of additional materials along their path, river-damming effects, and incorporation or displacement of water in the periglacial environment; process complexity, involving long and complex process chains with instantaneous and/or delayed cascades, thus represents a challenge to quantitative hazard assessment. CMF initiate in uninhabited or sparsely populated areas of the mountain cryosphere and frequently descend into denser populated areas where they impact on mountain communities and infrastructure. CMF have been responsible for several notable mountain disasters since 1940 resulting in the deaths of over 15,000 people worldwide. Our focus on an examination of process complexity illuminates an assessment of CMF hazard in ice-affected mountain regions and forms the basis for the development of mitigation strategies based on detection, warning, engineering techniques in source and runout areas, and land-use controls. The precise relationship between the magnitude/frequency of CMF and change in the mountain cryosphere since ca. 1900 remains uncertain.},

  abstract = {From 1965 to 2000 glacial geomorphology became increasingly specialized and developed significantly due to technological improvements, particularly in remote sensing, surveying and field-based glaciological process studies. The better understanding of basal thermal regimes in ice sheets and glaciers led to the development of concepts such as spatial and temporal migration of ice divides in dynamic ice sheets that could overprint subglacial landform assemblages, debris entrainment processes related to polythermal glacier systems, and glacier and ice sheet beds composed of cold and warm based mosaics. Process observations at the ice{\textendash}bed interface led to the discovery of the third glacier flow mechanism, substrate deformation, which provided the impetus to reconstruct the genesis of subglacial bedforms such as drumlins and to evaluate the origins and potential flow law for till. Numerical evaluations of glacial erosion led to a better understanding of abrasion and quarrying as well as the erection of genetic models and erosion rates for larger-scale features such as U-shaped valleys and cirques. Linkages were made between debris transport pathways and moraine construction in supraglacial environments, with the role of glacier structure being linked to specific landforms, such as medial, lateral, hummocky and ice-cored moraines as well as rock glaciers. Our appreciation of the erosional and depositional impacts of glacifluvial systems was enhanced significantly with the advent of process observations on the hydrology of modern glaciers as well as the final vindication of J.H. Bretz and his proposed j{\"o}kulhlaup origins of the Channelled Scablands and the Missoula Floods. In addition to the increasing numbers of studies at modern glacier snouts, the embracing of sedimentology by glacial geomorphologists was to result in significant developments in understanding the process-form regimes of subglacial, marginal and proglacial landforms, particularly the recognition of landform continua and hybrids. Advances resulting from this included the recognition of different modes of moraine and glacitectonic thrust mass development, lithofacies models of the varied glacifluvial depositional environments, and the initial expansion of work on the sediments and depocentres of glacimarine settings, the latter being the result of glacial research taking to submersibles and ice-strengthened ships for the first time. A similarly new frontier was the expansion of research on the increasingly higher resolution images returning from Mars, where extraterrestrial glaciations were recognized based on comparisons with Earth analogues. Holistic appreciations of glaciation signatures using landform assemblages were developed, initially as processform models and later as glacial landsystems, providing an ever-expanding set of templates for reconstructing palaeoglaciology in the wide variety of topographic and environmental settings, which also acknowledge spatial and temporal change in glacier and ice sheet systems.},

  abstract = {Three geological provinces are recognized, separated by major fault zones: the oceanic Lofoten Basin and the Vestbakken volcanic province in the west; the southwestern Barents Sea basin province; and the eastern region which has largely acted as a stable platform since Late Paleozoic times. Since Middle Jurassic times, two structural stages are recognized in the southwestern Barents Sea: Late Mesozoic rifting and basin formation; and Early Tertiary rifting and opening of the Norwegian-Greenland Sea. This evolution reflects the main plate tectonic episodes in the North Atlantic-Arctic break-up of Pangea. Middle-Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous structuration were characterized by regional extension accompanied by strike-slip adjustments along old structural lineaments, which developed as the Bjornoya, Tromso and Harstad basins. Late Cretaceous development was more complex, with extension west of the Senja Ridge and the Veslemoy High, and halokinesis in the Tromso Basin. Tertiary structuration was related to the two-stage opening of the Norwegian-Greenland Sea and the formation of the predominantly sheared western Barents Sea continental margin. Tectonic activity shifted towards the west in successive phases. The southwestern Barents Sea basin province developed within the De Geer Zone in a region of rift-shear interaction. Initially, oblique extension linked the Arctic and North Atlantic rift systems (Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous). Later, a continental megashear developed (Late CretaceousPaleocene), and finally a sheared-rifted margin formed during the opening of the Norwegian-Greenland Sea (Eocene-Recent).},

Over the past century, we have gone from point measurements of snow water equivalent (SWE) to estimate spring and summer runoff volumes, to remote sensing of various snowpack properties at continuously finer spatial and temporal resolutions, to various complexities of snowpack and hydrological modeling, to the current fusion of field data with remote sensing and modeling, all to improve our estimates of the snowpack and the subsequent runoff. However, we are still limited by the uncertainty induced by scaling from point field measurements to the area represented by remote sensing and modeling. This paper uses several examples of fine-resolution sampling to issue a call to snow hydrologists and other earth scientists to collect more data, or at least to thoroughly evaluate their sampling strategy for collecting ground-truth measurements. Recommendations are provided for different approaches to have more representative sampling, when at all possible, to collect at least a few more samples or data points.},

Often the mean of three snow depth measurements is used to represent snow depth at a location. This location is used as a proxy for an area, typically a digital elevation model (DEM) or remotely sensed pixel. Here, 11, 17, or 21 snow depth measurements were used to represent the mean snow depth of a 30-m DEM pixel. Using the center snow depth measurement for each sampling set was not adequate to represent the pixel mean, and while the use of three snow depth measurements improved the estimate of mean, there is still large error for some pixels. These measurements were then used to determine the variability of snow depth across a pixel. Estimating variability from few points rather than all in a measurement was not sufficient. The sampling size was increased from one to the total per pixel (11, 17, or 21) to determine how many point samples were necessary to approximate the mean snow depth per pixel within five percent. Binary regression trees were constructed to determine which terrain and canopy variables dictated the spatial distribution of the snow depth, the standard deviation of snow depth, and the sample size to within 5\% of the mean per pixel. One location was measured in two years just prior to peak accumulation, and it is shown that there was little to no inter-annual consistency in the mean or standard deviation.},

Here we show that permafrost peatlands in Europe and Western Siberia will soon surpass a climatic tipping point under scenarios of moderate-to-high warming (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5). The total peatland area affected under these scenarios contains 37.0{\textendash}39.5\,Gt carbon (equivalent to twice the amount of carbon stored in European forests). Our bioclimatic models indicate that all of Fennoscandia will become climatically unsuitable for peatland permafrost by 2040. Strong action to reduce emissions (SSP1-2.6) by the 2090s could retain suitable climates for permafrost peatlands storing 13.9\,Gt carbon in northernmost Western Siberia, indicating that socio-economic policies will determine the rate and extent of permafrost peatland thaw.},

This hampers the assessment of the current and future evolution of important issues such as water availability or mass movement hazards. Here, we present a new processing chain that couples an efficient sub-grid method with a downscaling tool and a data assimilation method with the purpose of improving numerical simulation of surface processes at multiple spatial and temporal scales in ungauged basins. The novelty of the approach is that while we add 1{\textendash}2 orders of magnitude of computational cost due to ensemble simulations, we save 4{\textendash}5 orders of magnitude over explicitly simulating a high-resolution grid. This approach makes data assimilation at large spatio-temporal scales feasible. In addition, this approach utilizes only freely available global datasets and is therefore able to run globally. We demonstrate marked improvements in estimating snow height and snow water equivalent at various scales using this approach that assimilates retrievals from a MODIS snow cover product. We propose that this as a suitable method for a wide variety of operational and research applications where surface models need to be run at large scales with sparse to non-existent ground observations and with the flexibility to assimilate diverse variables retrieved by Earth observation missions.},

This study describes and evaluates a new downscaling scheme that specifically addresses the need for hillslope-scale atmospheric-forcing time series for modelling the local impact of regional climate change projections on the land surface in complex terrain. The method has a global scope in that it does not rely directly on surface observations and is able to generate the full suite of model forcing variables required for hydrological and land surface modelling in hourly time steps. It achieves this by utilizing the previously published TopoSCALE scheme to generate synthetic observations of the current climate at the hillslope scale while accounting for a broad range of surface{\textendash}atmosphere interactions. These synthetic observations are then used to debias (downscale) CORDEX climate variables using the quantile mapping method. A further temporal disaggregation step produces sub-daily fields. This approach has the advantages of other empirical{\textendash}statistical methods, including speed of use, while it avoids the need for ground data, which are often limited. It is therefore a suitable method for a wide range of remote regions where ground data is absent, incomplete, or not of sufficient length. The approach is evaluated using a network of high-elevation stations across the Swiss Alps, and a test application in which the impacts of climate change on Alpine snow cover are modelled.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Simulation of land surface processes is problematic in heterogeneous terrain due to the the high resolution required of model grids to capture strong lateral variability caused by, for example, topography, and the lack of accurate meteorological forcing data at the site or scale it is required. Gridded data products produced by atmospheric models can fill this gap, however, often not at an appropriate spatial resolution to drive land-surface simulations. In this study we describe a method that uses the well-resolved description of the atmospheric column provided by climate models, together with high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs), to downscale coarse-grid climate variables to a fine-scale subgrid. The main aim of this approach is to provide high-resolution driving data for a land-surface model (LSM).  The method makes use of an interpolation of pressure-level data according to topographic height of the subgrid. An elevation and topography correction is used to downscale short-wave radiation. Long-wave radiation is downscaled by deriving a cloud-component of all-sky emissivity at grid level and using downscaled temperature and relative humidity fields to describe variability with elevation. Precipitation is downscaled with a simple non-linear lapse and optionally disaggregated using a climatology approach.  We test the method in comparison with unscaled grid-level data and a set of reference methods, against a large evaluation dataset (up to 210 stations per variable) in the Swiss Alps. We demonstrate that the method can be used to derive meteorological inputs in complex terrain, with most significant improvements (with respect to reference methods) seen in variables derived from pressure levels: air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and incoming long-wave radiation.  This method may be of use in improving inputs to numerical simulations in heterogeneous and/or remote terrain, especially when statistical methods are not possible, due to lack of observations (i.e. remote areas or future periods).},

One of the possible solutions is to obtain freshwater from drifting icebergs. The towing of large icebergs is the topic analyzed in various freshwater supply projects conducted in different zone-specific regions of the world. These projects show general effects of iceberg transport efficiency but do not present a detailed methodology for the calculation of their mass losses. The aim of this article is to develop the methodology to calculate the mass losses of icebergs transported on a selected route. A multi-agent simulation was used, and the numerical model to estimate the melting rate of the iceberg during its energy-efficient towing was developed. Moreover, the effect of towing speed on the iceberg's mass loss was determined. It was stated that the maximum use of ocean currents, despite longer route and increased transport time, allows for energy-efficient transport of the iceberg. The optimal towing speed of the iceberg on the selected route was recommended at the range of 0.4{\textendash}1 m/s. The achieved results may be of interest to institutions responsible for sustainable development and dealing with water resources and freshwater supply.},

  abstract = {There is now a large published literature on the strengths and weaknesses of downscaling methods for different climatic variables, in different regions and seasons. However, little attention is given to the choice of downscaling method when examining the impacts of climate change on hydrological systems. This review paper assesses the current downscaling literature, examining new developments in the downscaling field specifically for hydrological impacts. Sections focus on the downscaling concept; new methods; comparative methodological studies; the modelling of extremes; and the application to hydrological impacts. Consideration is then given to new developments in climate scenario construction which may offer the most potential for advancement within the `downscaling for hydrological impacts' community, such as probabilistic modelling, pattern scaling and downscaling of multiple variables and suggests ways that they can be merged with downscaling techniques in a probabilistic climate change scenario framework to assess the uncertainties associated with future projections. Within hydrological impact studies there is still little consideration given to applied research; how the results can be best used to enable stakeholders and managers to make informed, robust decisions on adaptation and mitigation strategies in the face of many uncertainties about the future. It is suggested that there is a need for a move away from comparison studies into the provision of decision-making tools for planning and management that are robust to future uncertainties; with examination and understanding of uncertainties within the modelling system.

The pace of Arctic warming is two-to-three times that of the globe; this disparity reached a new record high during 2016. While the Arctic spans only a small fraction of the Earth, it plays a disproportionate and multifaceted role in the climate system. In this article, we offer new perspectives on ways in which the Arctic's rapid warming may influence weather patterns in heavily populated regions (the mid-latitudes) of the Northern Hemisphere. Research on this topic has evolved almost as rapidly as the snow and ice have diminished, and while much has been learned, many questions remain. The atmosphere is complex, highly variable, and undergoing a multitude of simultaneous changes, many of which have become apparent only recently. These realities present challenges to robust signal detection and to clear attribution of cause-and-effect. In addition to updating the state of this science, we propose an explanation for the varying and intermittent response of mid-latitude circulation to the rapidly warming Arctic.

  abstract = {Modeling snow redistribution by wind and avalanches in hydrological studies in alpine catchments is important, as the spatial variability of the snow cover has an impact on timing and magnitude of the snowmelt runoff. Disregarding snow redistribution in models can lead to the formation of `snow towers,' i.e., multi-year accumulation of snow at high elevations and an incorrect water balance. The reviewed approaches to deal with snow redistribution in hydrological models were first broadly grouped by the represented physical processes: (1) the correction of the precipitation input data to account mainly for preferential deposition, (2) the description of all wind-driven processes based on wind field data, (3) the description of gravitational transports and/or wind-driven processes based on topographic information, and (4) the statistical description of the variability of the snow water equivalent (SWE) to account for all types of snow redistribution. The review further assessed the implementation of these approaches in physically based and bucket-type hydrological models. Generally, snow redistribution consideration has improved the simulation of snow patterns and SWE and consequently the prediction of discharge in mountain catchments worldwide. Snow redistribution approaches still have some limitations and a large gap exists between the knowledge and processes in highly detailed physically based snow models and the widely used bucket-type hydrological models used for water resources and climate change studies. There is a real need to bridge this gap using the knowledge earned by snow redistribution modeling with established physically based models to develop more conceptual approaches for the application in bucket-type models.

A seismic image of the complex subsurface structure is therefore of great interest for the hydrocarbon industries, as well as for a more detailed understanding of the development of the basin and the Alps.

  abstract = {Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is one of the most sufficient technologies to provide global digital elevation modeling (DEM). It unwraps the interferometric phase to provide observations for phase-to-height conversion. However, the phase gradient has great influence on the phase unwrapping quality, thereby affecting the topographic mapping accuracy. Multi-look processing can improve the reliability of phase unwrapping by reducing the noise phase gradient. Nevertheless, it reduces the spatial resolution while increasing the height phase gradient, thus lowering the reliability of height values. In this paper, we propose a multi-look iteration algorithm to suppress the noise and maintain the reliability of height values. First, we use a large number of looks (NL) to suppress the noise phase gradient and obtain a coarse DEM. Then taking this coarse DEM as a reference, we remove the topographic phase from the interferogram with a small NL, which will reduce height phase gradient and ensure the accuracy of phase unwrapping. Finally, we obtain DEM products with high precision and fine resolution. We validate the proposed algorithm using both simulated and real data, and obtain DEM products in a greatly undulated region using TanDEM-X data. Results show that the proposed method is capable of providing DEM with resolution of 4 m and accuracy of 1.73 m.},

To estimate the regionwide glacier mass balance for 9 study sites spread from the Pamir to the Hengduan Shan (eastern Himalaya), we compared the 2000 Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) to recent (2008{\textendash}2011) DEMs derived from SPOT5 stereo imagery. During the last decade, the region-wide glacier mass balances were contrasted with moderate mass losses in the eastern and central Himalaya (-0.22 {$\pm$} 0.12 m w.e. yr-1 to -0.33 {$\pm$} 0.14 m w.e. yr-1) and larger losses in the western Himalaya (-0.45 {$\pm$} 0.13 m w.e. yr-1). Recently reported slight mass gain or balanced mass budget of glaciers in the central Karakoram is confirmed for a larger area (+0.10 {$\pm$} 0.16 m w.e. yr-1) and also observed for glaciers in the western Pamir (+0.14 {$\pm$} 0.13 m w.e. yr-1). Thus, the ``Karakoram anomaly'' should be renamed the ``PamirKarakoram anomaly'', at least for the last decade. The overall mass balance of PKH glaciers, -0.14 {$\pm$} 0.08 m w.e. yr-1, is two to three times less negative than the global average for glaciers distinct from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Together with recent studies using ICESat and GRACE data, DEM differencing confirms a contrasted pattern of glacier mass change in the PKH during the first decade of the 21st century.},

Earth system models are important tools for exploring past and future snowpack variability, yet their coarse spatial resolutions distort local topography and bias spatial patterns of accumulation and ablation. Here, we explore pattern-based statistical downscaling for spatially-continuous interannual snowpack estimates. We find that a few leading patterns capture the majority of snowpack variability across the western US in observations, reanalyses, and free-running simulations. Pattern-based downscaling methods yield accurate, high resolution maps that correct mean and variance biases in domain-wide simulated snowpack. Methods that use large-scale patterns as both predictors and predictands perform better than those that do not and all are superior to an interpolation-based ``delta change'' approach. These findings suggest that pattern-based methods are appropriate for downscaling interannual snowpack variability and that using physically meaningful large-scale patterns is more important than the details of any particular downscaling method.},

  abstract = {Class imbalance in classification tasks leads to biased learning in the model training phase. In case of regression, the presence of rare cases over the normal cases in the target variable, also culminates in data imbalance. Since, the target variable is continuous in nature, the handling of imbalance in regression tasks is not straightforward when compared to that of classification tasks. Synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) and its variants have been explored in upsampling rare events in imbalanced regression. These approaches solely rely on amplitude values of features and their nearest neighbours during the upsampling process. However, geo-tagged spatial data comes with an additional location information, i.e. latitude and longitude. This information needs to be incorporated during upsampling process in order to retain the spatial dependencies in the underlying data. We thus propose a new pipeline named, `Spatial-SMOTE for regression', which deals with upsampling the rare events by retaining the significance of the spatial distribution of data. The effectiveness of this process is shown on two geo-tagged regression datasets for predicting the normal and the rare cases of the target variable. The performance of this pipeline is compared against closely related state-of-the-art methods. The upsampling approaches are tested exhaustively using different classifiers. It is found that the proposed `Spatial-SMOTE for regression' method performs better with improvements in \$\$F\_\{score\}\$\$as high as 11.55\% and 16.9\% for the two datasets used for the study. Factors affecting the misclassification errors in case of the proposed study is analysed in detail.},

  abstract = {The past two decades have been prolific in production of global or near-global Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) derived from satellite data. The most recent addition to the family of global DEMs is the TanDEM-X DEM with resolution of 0.4 arc sec. DEMs are essential for a wide range of environmental applications, many of which are related to mountains including studies on natural hazards, forestry or glacier mass changes. However, synthetic aperture radar interferometry used for acquisition of TanDEM-X DEM is especially challenging over steep and irregular mountain surfaces due to shadowing and foreshortening effects. In this study, we assessed the absolute vertical accuracy of TanDEM-X DEM in European mountains. We compared it with both a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and a Digital Surface Model (DSM) derived from airborne laser scanning data. Our results indicate that the height error of TanDEM-X DEM expressed as absolute deviation at the 90\% quantile is consistent with the 10 m mission specification benchmark. We further concentrated on the absolute height error with respect to environmental characteristics (i.e. forested and non-forested areas, slope, and aspect). The comparison of TanDEM-X DEM with a reference DTM showed a positive vertical offset; however, the mean error differed greatly between forested and non-forested areas. When compared to reference DSM, our results showed a slight underestimation. We observed the highest underestimation in deciduous forests, followed by coniferous forests and non-forested areas. A significant decrease in accuracy was observed with increasing slope, especially for slopes above 10{$^\circ$}. In mountains where the imagery was acquired only in one orbit direction (i.e. ascending for Northern hemisphere), the largest TanDEM-X DEM error when compared to DSM was recorded for the westfacing slopes (i.e. slopes facing the sensor); however, the association with terrain orientation diminished in mountains, the imagery of which was acquired from both the ascending and descending orbit. Finally, we evaluated the effect of data acquisition characteristics provided with TanDEM-X DEM as auxiliary data. Our results show that two coverages might not be sufficient in mountain environment. Additional acquisitions, especially those with different acquisition geometry, improved the absolute vertical accuracy of TanDEM-X DEM and eliminated areas of inconsistency. We discourage from using the Height Error Map (HEM) to estimate the error magnitude. On the other hand, auxiliary data (COM, COV) provide valuable information that should be always used in pre-analyses to identify possible problematic areas.},

  abstract = {Recent progress in machine learning (ML) inspires the idea of improving (or learning) earth system models directly from the observations. Earth sciences already use data assimilation (DA), which underpins decades of progress in weather forecasting. DA and ML have many similarities: they are both inverse methods that can be united under a Bayesian (probabilistic) framework. ML could benefit from approaches used in DA, which has evolved to deal with real observations{\textemdash}these are uncertain, sparsely sampled, and only indirectly sensitive to the processes of interest. DA could also become more like ML and start learning improved models of the earth system, using parameter estimation, or by directly incorporating machine-learnable models. DA follows the Bayesian approach more exactly in terms of representing uncertainty, and in retaining existing physical knowledge, which helps to better constrain the learnt aspects of models. This article makes equivalences between DA and ML in the unifying framework of Bayesian networks. These help illustrate the equivalences between four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) DA and a recurrent neural network (RNN), for example. More broadly, Bayesian networks are graphical representations of the knowledge and processes embodied in earth system models, giving a framework for organising modelling components and knowledge, whether coming from physical equations or learnt from observations. Their full Bayesian solution is not computationally feasible but these networks can be solved with approximate methods already used in DA and ML, so they could provide a practical framework for the unification of the two. Development of all these approaches could address the grand challenge of making better use of observations to improve physical models of earth system processes.

  abstract = {Earth system models (ESMs) are the primary tools for investigating future Earth system states at timescales from decades to centuries, especially in response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas release. State-of-the-art ESMs can reproduce the observational global mean temperature anomalies of the last 150 years. Nevertheless, ESMs need further improvements, most importantly regarding (i) the large spread in their estimates of climate sensitivity, i.e., the temperature response to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases; (ii) the modeled spatial patterns of key variables such as temperature and precipitation; (iii) their representation of extreme weather events; and (iv) their representation of multistable Earth system components and the ability to predict associated abrupt transitions. Here, we argue that making ESMs automatically differentiable has a huge potential to advance ESMs, especially with respect to these key shortcomings. First, automatic differentiability would allow objective calibration of ESMs, i.e., the selection of optimal values with respect to a cost function for a large number of free parameters, which are currently tuned mostly manually. Second, recent advances in machine learning (ML) and in the number, accuracy, and resolution of observational data promise to be helpful with at least some of the above aspects because ML may be used to incorporate additional information from observations into ESMs. Automatic differentiability is an essential ingredient in the construction of such hybrid models, combining process-based ESMs with ML components. We document recent work showcasing the potential of automatic differentiation for a new generation of substantially improved, data-informed ESMs.},

Their output is widely used in climate impacts research for modeling the current and future effects of climate change. However, climate model output remains coarse in relation to the high-resolution climate data needed for climate impacts studies, and it also exhibits biases relative to observational data. Treatment of the distribution tails is a key challenge in existing downscaled climate datasets available at a global scale; many of these datasets used quantile mapping techniques that were known to dampen or amplify trends in the tails. In this study, we apply the trend-preserving Quantile Delta Mapping (QDM) bias-adjustment method (Cannon et al., 2015) and develop a new downscaling method called the Quantile-Preserving Localized-Analog Downscaling (QPLAD) method that also preserves trends in the distribution tails. Both methods are integrated into a transparent and reproducible software pipeline, which we apply to global, daily model output for surface variables (maximum and minimum temperature and total precipitation) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) experiments (O\&rsquo;Neill et al., 2016) for the historical experiment and four future emissions scenarios ranging from aggressive mitigation to no mitigation: SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 (Riahi et al., 2017). We use European Centre for Medium-RangeWeather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 (Hersbach et al., 2018) temperature and precipitation reanalysis data as the reference dataset over the Sixth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report (AR6) reference period, 1995\&ndash;2014. We produce bias-adjusted and downscaled data over the historical period (1950\&ndash;2014) and for four emissions pathways (2015\&ndash;2100) for 25 models in total.

Thus there exists a large gap between the available data sets and the demands of climate impact studies. The presented approach aims to generate spatially high resolution precipitation fields for a target area in central Asia, covering the Tibetan Plateau and the adjacent mountain ranges and lowlands. Based on the assumption that observed local-scale precipitation amounts are triggered by varying large-scale atmospheric situations and modified by local-scale topographic characteristics, the statistical downscaling approach estimates local-scale precipitation rates as a function of large-scale atmospheric conditions, derived from the ERA-Interim reanalysis and high-resolution terrain parameters. Since the relationships of the predictor variables with local-scale observations are rather unknown and highly nonlinear, an artificial neural network (ANN) was utilized for the development of adequate transfer functions. Different ANN architectures were evaluated with regard to their predictive performance. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} The final downscaling model was used for the cellwise estimation of monthly precipitation sums, the number of rainy days and the maximum daily precipitation amount with a spatial resolution of 1 km\textsuperscript{2}.

A concluding sensitivity analysis of the ANN model reveals the effect of the atmospheric and topographic predictor variables on the precipitation estimations in the climatically diverse subregions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The impact of declining sea ice in amplifying surface air temperatures (SAT) over the Arctic Ocean is readily visible, and this ``Arctic amplification'' will become more pronounced as more sea ice is lost in the coming decades. The effect of sea ice loss on atmospheric temperatures and circulation patterns is of utmost significance as these changes will affect the terrestrial climate. Land-surface snow is vulnerable to these changes; hence, we search for any link between changes in Arctic sea ice and Northern Hemisphere snow cover. Analyses of observational data sets suggest that the increasing snow cover over Siberia during fall and early winter is correlated with the decreasing September Arctic sea ice over the Pacific sector. We also examine modeled covariance between sea ice and snow using historical and future simulations of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM3). Results indicate the emergence of a Siberian snow signal during the last half of the 21st century most strongly during late winter. Moreover, CCSM3 future simulations show diminishment of snow at a hemispheric scale outside of the Siberian region, which is correlated with the loss of Arctic sea ice. These results indicate that we may be seeing the first, albeit weak, signs of ``Arctic amplification'' on the terrestrial Arctic snowpack; that only a weak and therefore inconclusive signal would be expected at this time; and that the signal should strengthen over the coming decades.},

RCMs were primarily developed to provide fine-scale climate information for impact studies, but they have evolved into general and multipurpose modeling tools. Among the main achievements in RCM research the focus is on: the development of community RCMs applicable to a wide variety of studies and regional contexts; the increase of model simulation length up to centennial scales and spatial resolutions up to convection-permitting scales (few kilometers), leading to a better understanding of regional to local climate change signals; the development of fully coupled Regional Earth System Models; the inception of intercomparison projects culminating in the international Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment; the extensive use of RCM simulations for impact assessments; and the involvement of the scientific community from developing countries in climate modeling research. Among the outstanding issues in need of more attention are the Added Value of using this downscaling technique; various technical aspects concerning RCM simulations; and uncertainties in RCM-based climate projections. Future directions in RCM research are discussed, with highlight on: transition to convection-permitting modeling systems; further development of Regional Earth System Models including the human component; next phase of the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment project; and use of RCMs in the distillation of actionable information for contribution to climate service activities.

The potential of these data in terms of geomorphological analysis and change detection in three dimensions is unrivaled and should be exploited more. Due to uncorrected errors in the image geometry due to sensor motion (``jitter''), however, the quality of the DEMs and orthoimages currently available is often insufficient for a number of applications, including surface change detection. We have therefore developed a series of algorithms packaged under the name MicMac ASTER (MMASTER). It is composed of a tool to compute Rational Polynomial Coefficient (RPC) models from the ASTER metadata, a method that improves the quality of the matching by identifying and correcting jitter-induced cross-track parallax errors and a correction for along-track jitter when computing differences between DEMs (either with another MMASTER DEM or with another data source). Our method outputs more precise DEMs with less unmatched areas and reduced overall noise compared to NASA's standard AST14DMO product. The algorithms were implemented in the open source photogrammetric library and software suite MicMac. Here, we briefly examine the potential of MMASTER-produced DEMs to investigate a variety of geomorphological changes, including river erosion, seismic deformation, changes in biomass, volcanic deformation and glacier mass balance.},

  abstract = {As the Earth warms, the spatial and temporal response of seasonal snow remains uncertain. The global snow science community estimates snow cover and mass with information from land surface models, numerical weather prediction, satellite observations, surface measurements, and combinations thereof. Accurate estimation of snow at the spatial and temporal scales over which snow varies has historically been challenged by the complexity of land cover and terrain and the large global extent of snow-covered regions. Like many Earth science disciplines, snow science is in an era of rapid advances as remote sensing products and models continue to gain granularity and physical fidelity. Despite clear progress, the snow science community continues to face challenges related to the accuracy of seasonal snow estimation. Namely, advances in snow modeling remain limited by uncertainties in modeling parameterization schemes and input forcings, and advances in remote sensing techniques remain limited by temporal, spatial, and technical constraints on the variables that can be observed. Accurate monitoring and modeling of snow improves our ability to assess Earth system conditions, trends, and future projections while serving highly valued global interests in water supply and weather forecasts. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand and improve the errors and uncertainties associated with estimates of snow. A potential method to overcome model and observational shortcomings is data assimilation, which leverages the information content in both observations and models while minimizing their limitations due to uncertainty. This article proposes data assimilation as a way to reduce uncertainties in the characterization of seasonal snow changes and reviews current modeling, remote sensing, and data assimilation techniques applied to the estimation of seasonal snow. Finally, remaining challenges for seasonal snow estimation are discussed.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The strong winds prevalent in high altitude and arctic environments heavily redistribute the snow cover, causing a small-scale pattern of highly variable snow depths. This has profound implications for the ground thermal regime, resulting in highly variable near-surface ground temperatures on the metre scale. Due to asymmetric snow distributions combined with the nonlinear insulating effect of snow, the spatial average ground temperature in a 1 km\textsuperscript{2} area cannot be determined based on the average snow cover for that area. Land surface or permafrost models employing a coarsely classified average snow depth will therefore not yield a realistic representation of ground temperatures. In this study we employ statistically derived snow distributions within 1 km\textsuperscript{2} grid cells as input to a regional permafrost model in order to represent sub-grid variability of ground temperatures. This improves the representation of both the average and the total range of ground temperatures. The model reproduces observed sub-grid ground temperature variations of up to 6 \&deg;C, and 98 \% of borehole observations match the modelled temperature range. The mean modelled temperature of the grid cell reproduces the observations with an accuracy of 1.5 \&deg;C or better. The observed sub-grid variations in ground surface temperatures from two field sites are very well reproduced, with estimated fractions of sub-zero mean annual ground surface temperatures within \&pm;10 \%. We also find that snow distributions within areas of 1 km\textsuperscript{2} in Norwegian mountain environments are closer to a gamma than to a lognormal theoretical distribution. The modelled permafrost distribution seems to be more sensitive to the choice of distribution function than to the fine-tuning of the coefficient of variation. When incorporating the small-scale variation of snow, the modelled total permafrost area of mainland Norway is nearly twice as large compared to the area obtained with grid-cell average snow depths without a sub-grid approach.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The growing share of electricity production from solar and mainly wind resources constantly increases the stochastic nature of the power system. Modelling the high share of renewable energy sources {\textendash} and in particular wind power {\textendash} crucially depends on the adequate representation of the intermittency and characteristics of the wind resource which is related to the accuracy of the approach in converting wind speed data into power values. One of the main factors contributing to the uncertainty in these conversion methods is the selection of the spatial resolution. Although numerical weather prediction models can simulate wind speeds at higher spatial resolution (up to 1{\texttimes}1km) than a reanalysis (generally, ranging from about 25km to 70km), they require high computational resources and massive storage systems: therefore, the most common alternative is to use the reanalysis data. However, local wind features could not be captured by the use of a reanalysis technique and could be translated into misinterpretations of the wind power peaks, ramping capacities, the behaviour of power prices, as well as bidding strategies for the electricity market. This study contributes to the understanding what is captured by different wind speeds spatial resolution datasets, the importance of using high resolution data for the conversion into power and the implications in power system analyses. It is proposed a methodology to increase the spatial resolution from a reanalysis. This study presents an open access renewable generation time series dataset for the EU-28 and neighbouring countries at hourly intervals and at different geographical aggregation levels (country, bidding zone and administrative territorial unit), for a 30year period taking into account the wind generating fleet at the end of 2015.},

The high temporal resolution of the Meteosat satellites and their long term availability since 1977 make their data highly valuable for climate studies. In order to ensure that the LSA SAF LST product continuously meets its target accuracy of 2 \H{}C, it is validated with in-situ measurements from four dedicated LST validation stations. Three stations are located in highly homogenous areas in Africa (semiarid bush, desert, and Kalahari semi-desert) and typically provide thousands of monthly match-ups with LSA SAF LST, which are used to perform seasonally resolved validations. An uncertainty analysis performed for desert station Gobabeb yielded an estimate of total in-situ LST uncertainty of 0.8 {\textasciibreve} 0.12 \H{}C. Ignoring rainy seasons, the results for the period 2009{\textendash}2014 show that LSA SAF LST consistently meets its target accuracy: the highest mean root-mean-square error (RMSE) for LSA SAF LST over the African stations was 1.6 \H{}C while mean absolute bias was 0.1 \H{}C. Nighttime and daytime biases were up to 0.7 \H{}C but had opposite signs: when evaluated together, these partially compensated each other.},

  abstract = {Future power production in Europe is expected to include large shares of variable wind and solar power production. Norway, with approximately half of the hydropower reservoir capacity in Europe, can contribute to balance the variability. The aim of this paper is to assess how such a role may impact the Norwegian hydropower system in terms of production pattern of the plants, changes in reservoir level and water values. The study uses a stochastic optimization and simulation model and analyses an eHighway2050 scenario combined with increases in the hydropower production capacities in Norway. The capacity increases from ca. 31 GW in the present system to 42 and 50 GW respectively. The study uses 75 years with stochastic wind, solar radiation, temperature and inflow data. The results show that the hydropower system is able to partly balance the variable production and significantly reduce the power prices for the analyzed case. The paper shows that some of the power plants utilize their increased capacity, while other plants do not due to hydrological constraints and model limitations. The paper discusses how the modelling can be further improved in order to quantify more of the potential impacts on the future power system.},

These interactions relate to enhanced heat flow, tephra in contact with the ice and snow resulting in the alteration of surficial ablation, and interaction with pyroclastic flows and incandescent materials. Such interactions can result in the formation of differential ablation, in tephra remobilization and, especially, in the generation of sometimes farreaching lahars. Disasters resulted from recent events at Mount St. Helens (1980{\textendash}1986) and Nevado del Ruiz (1985) illustrate the impact these interactions can have. Case studies from Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, and Chile are described. These descriptions depict the way in which the volcanic activity has interacted with ice bodies in recent volcanic crises (Popocat epetl, Mexico; Nevado del Huila, Colombia; and Llaima and Villarica, Chile) and how the laharic processes have been generated. Reconstruction of historical events (Cotopaxi, Ecuador) or interpretation of events from the geological remains (Citlat epetl, Mexico) helps to document past events which today could be disastrous for people and infrastructure now existing at the corresponding sites. A primary challenge for hazard prevention and risk reduction is the difficulty of making decisions based on imperfect information and a large degree of uncertainty. Successful assessments have resulted in the protection of lives in recent cases such as at Nevado del Huila (Colombia).},

Statistical downscaling aims to approximate this task using statistical patterns gleaned from an existing dataset of downscaled values, often obtained from observations or physical models. In this work, we investigate the application of deep latent variable learning to the task of statistical downscaling. We present ClimAlign, a novel method for unsupervised, generative downscaling using adaptations of recent work in normalizing flows for variational inference. We evaluate the viability of our method using several different metrics on two datasets consisting of daily temperature and precipitation values gridded at low (1 degree latitude/longitude) and high (1/4 and 1/8 degree) resolutions. We show that our method achieves comparable predictive performance to existing supervised statistical downscaling methods while simultaneously allowing for both conditional and unconditional sampling from the joint distribution over high and low resolution spatial fields. We provide publicly accessible implementations of our method, as well as the baselines used for comparison, on GitHub.},

The primary goal of the TanDEM-X mission is the derivation of a global digital elevation model (DEM) with unprecedented global accuracies of 10m in absolute and 2m in relative height. A significant calibration effort is required to achieve this high quality world-wide. In spite of an intensive instrument calibration and a highly accurate orbit and baseline determination, some systematic height errors like offsets and tilts in the order of some meters remain in the interferometric DEMs and have to be determined and removed during the TanDEM-X DEM calibration. The objective of this article is the presentation of an approach for the estimation of correction parameters for remaining systematic height errors applicable to interferometric height models. The approach is based on a least-squares block adjustment using the elevation of ICESat GLA14 data as ground control points and connecting points of adjacent, overlapping DEMs as tie-points. In the first part its implementation in DLR's ground segment is outlined. In the second part the approach is applied and validated for two of the first TanDEM-X DEM test sites. Therefore, independent reference data, in particular high resolution reference DEMs and GPS tracks, are used. The results show that the absolute height errors of the TanDEM-X DEM are small in these cases, mostly in the order of 1{\textendash}2m. An additional benefit of the proposed block adjustment method is that it improves the relative accuracy of adjacent DEMs.},

While MERRA-2 has been a de-facto standard in many studies for a long time, the newer ERA5-reanalysis recently gained importance. Here, both datasets were used to simulate wind power generation and evaluate their quality in terms of correlations and error measures compared to historical data of wind power generation. Due to their coarse resolution, reanalyses are known to fail to represent local climatic conditions adequately. Hence, mean bias correction was applied with two versions of the Global Wind Atlas (GWA) to the reanalysis data and the quality of the resulting simulations was assessed. Potential users of these datasets can also benefit from our analysis of the impact of spatial and temporal aggregation on indicators of simulation quality. We also assessed regions which differ significantly in terms of the prevailing climate, some of which are underrepresented in similar studies: the US, Brazil, South-Africa, and New Zealand. Our principal findings are threefold. (i) ERA5 outperforms MERRA-2 in terms of the assessed error measures. (ii) Bias-correction with GWA2 does not improve simulation quality substantially, while bias-correction with GWA3 is detrimental. (iii) Temporal aggregation increases correlations and reduces errors, while spatial aggregation does so consistently only when comparing very fine and very coarse granularities.},

This multiple registration problem can be defined as a surface matching task. We treat it as least squares matching of overlapping surfaces. The surface may have been digitized/sampled point by point using a laser scanner device, a photogrammetric method or other surface measurement techniques. Our proposed method estimates the transformation parameters of one or more 3D search surfaces with respect to a 3D template surface, using the Generalized Gauss{\textendash}Markoff model, minimizing the sum of squares of the Euclidean distances between the surfaces. This formulation gives the opportunity of matching arbitrarily oriented 3D surface patches. It fully considers 3D geometry. Besides the mathematical model and execution aspects we address the further extensions of the basic model. We also show how this method can be used for curve matching in 3D space and matching of curves to surfaces. Some practical examples based on the registration of close-range laser scanner and photogrammetric point clouds are presented for the demonstration of the method. This surface matching technique is a generalization of the least squares image matching concept and offers high flexibility for any kind of 3D surface correspondence problem, as well as statistical tools for the analysis of the quality of final matching results.},

Using a new type of terrestrial laser scanner, which is particularly suited for measurements of snow covered surfaces, snow depth was monitored in a high alpine catchment during an ablation period. From these measurements snow water equivalents and ablation rates were calculated. This allowed us for the first time to obtain a high resolution (2.5 m cell size) picture of spatial variability of the snow cover and its temporal development. A very high variability of the snow cover with snow depths between 0{\textendash}9 m at the end of the accumulation season was observed. This variability decreased during the ablation phase, while the dominant snow deposition features remained intact. The average daily ablation rate was between 15 mm/d snow water equivalent at the beginning of the ablation period and 30 mm/d at the end. The spatial variation of ablation rates increased during the ablation season and could not be explained in a simple manner by geographical or meteorological parameters, which suggests significant lateral energy fluxes contributing to observed melt. It is qualitatively shown that the effect of the lateral energy transport must increase as the fraction of snow free surfaces increases during the ablation period.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The spatial distribution of alpine snow covers is characterised by large variability. Taking this variability into account is important for many tasks including hydrology, glaciology, ecology or natural hazards. Statistical modelling is frequently applied to assess the spatial variability of the snow cover. For this study, we assembled seven data sets of high-resolution snow-depth measurements from different mountain regions around the world. All data were obtained from airborne laser scanning near the time of maximum seasonal snow accumulation. Topographic parameters were used to model the snow depth distribution on the catchment-scale by applying multiple linear regressions. We found that by averaging out the substantial spatial heterogeneity at the metre scales, i.e. individual drifts and aggregating snow accumulation at the landscape or hydrological response unit scale (cell size 400 m), that 30 to 91\% of the snow depth variability can be explained by models that are calibrated to local conditions at the single study areas. As all sites were sparsely vegetated, only a few topographic variables were included as explanatory variables, including elevation, slope, the deviation of the aspect from north (northing), and a wind sheltering parameter. In most cases, elevation, slope and northing are very good predictors of snow distribution. A comparison of the models showed that importance of parameters and their coefficients differed among the catchments. A "global" model, combining all the data from all areas investigated, could only explain 23\% of the variability. It appears that local statistical models cannot be transferred to different regions. However, models developed on one peak snow season are good predictors for other peak snow seasons.},

  abstract = {The spatial distribution and the local amount of snow in mountainous regions strongly depend on the spatial characteristics of snowfall, snow deposition and snow redistribution. Uniform altitudinal gradients can only represent a part of these influences but are without alternative for use in larger-scale models. How well altitudinal gradients represent the true snow distribution has not been assessed. We analyse altitudinal characteristics of snow stored in two high-alpine catchments in Switzerland. Peak winter snow depths were monitored using high-resolution airborne laser scanning technology. These snow depths were transferred to snow water equivalent by applying simple density estimations. From these data, altitudinal gradients were calculated for the total catchment areas and for selected subareas characterized by different accumulation patterns. These gradients were then compared with gradients resulting from automated snow depth measurements obtained from several snow stations on different height levels located in the catchments, and with estimations from climatological precipitation gradients. The analysis showed that neither precipitation gradients nor flat-field stations estimate catchment-wide snow amounts accurately. While the climatological gradient showed different trends for different areas and years, the snow stations tended to overestimate mean snow amounts.},

  abstract = {Seasonal snow is sensitive to climate change, and is always taken as a signal of local climate changes. As changes in snow differ locally in their characteristics, it is necessary to detect the effects of snow on different land cover types. The middle and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere are located in a vast area of seasonal snow, experiencing snow accumulation and snowmelt stages each year. This study found that selected land cover types (open shrubland, evergreen needleleaf forest, and mixed forest) possess unique relationship curves between the snow cover fraction and snow depth. This has resulted in the northward shrinking of open shrubland and expansion of evergreen needleleaf forest and mixed forest, thereby further modulating local ecological systems. However, such changes in the snow process are not reproduced well by model parameterizations, and a faster melting process in the snowmelt stage will occur owing to the effects of global warming not being properly considered in such parametrization schemes. This inability to properly simulate the change in the snow process will affect our understanding of the ecological impacts of snowmelt in spring.

  abstract = {In this study, we assess the impact of forcing data errors, model structure, and parameter choices on 1-D snow simulations simultaneously within a global variance-based sensitivity analysis framework. This approach allows inclusion of interaction effects, drawing a more representative picture of the resulting sensitivities. We utilize all combinations of a multiphysics snowpack model to mirror the influence of model structure. Uncertainty ranges of model parameters and input data are extracted from the literature. We evaluate a suite of 230,000 model realizations at the snow monitoring station K{\"u}htai (Tyrol, Austria, 1,920 m above sea level) against snow water equivalent observations. The results show throughout the course of 25 winter seasons (1991{\textendash}2015) and different model performance criteria a large influence of forcing data uncertainty and its interactions on the model performance. Mean interannual total sensitivity indices are in the general order of parameter choice {$<$} model structure {$<$} forcing error, with precipitation, air temperature, and the radiative forcings controlling the variance during the accumulation period and air temperature and longwave irradiance controlling the variance during the ablation period, respectively. Model skill is highly sensitive to the snowpack liquid water transport scheme throughout the whole winter period and to albedo representation during the ablation period. We found a sufficiently long evaluation period ({$>$}10 years) is required for robust averaging. A considerable interaction effect was revealed, indicating that an improvement in the knowledge (i.e., reduction of uncertainty) of one factor alone might not necessarily improve model results.},

  abstract = {Ocean waves are a vital environmental factor that affects the accuracy of airborne laser bathymetry (ALB) systems. As the regional water surface undulates with randomness, the laser propagation direction through the air{\textendash}water surface will change and impact the underwater topographic result from the ALB system, especially for the small laser divergence system. However, the natural ocean surface changes rapidly over time, and uneven ocean surface point clouds from ALB scanning will cause an uncertain estimation of the laser propagation direction; therefore, a self-adaptive correction method based on the characteristics of the partial wave surface is key to improving the accuracy and applicability of the ALB system. In this paper, we focused on the issues of spatial position deviation caused by surface waves and position correction of the underwater laser footprint, and the dimension-based adaptive method is applied to attempt to correct the laser incidence angle. Simulation experiments and analysis of the actual measurement data from different ALB systems verified that the method can effectively suppress the influence of ocean waves. Furthermore, the inversion result of sea surface inclination changes is consistent with the surface wind wave reanalysis products. Based on the laser underwater propagation model in the strategy, we also quantitatively analyzed the influence of surface waves on laser bathymetry, which can guide the operation selection and data processing of the ALB system at specific water depths and under dynamic ocean conditions.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The performance of statistical downscaling (SD) techniques is critically reassessed with respect to their robust applicability in climate change studies. To this end, in addition to standard accuracy measures and distributional similarity scores, the authors estimate the robustness of the methods under warming climate conditions working with anomalous warm historical periods. This validation framework is applied to intercompare the performances of 12 different SD methods (from the analog, weather typing, and regression families) for downscaling minimum and maximum temperatures in Spain. First, a calibration of these methods is performed in terms of both geographical domains and predictor sets; the results are highly dependent on the latter, with optimum predictor sets including near-surface temperature data (in particular 2-m temperature), which appropriately discriminate cold episodes related to temperature inversion in the lower troposphere.             Although regression methods perform best in terms of correlation, analog and weather generator approaches are more appropriate for reproducing the observed distributions, especially in case of wintertime minimum temperature. However, the latter two families significantly underestimate the temperature anomalies of the warm periods considered in this work. This underestimation is found to be critical when considering the warming signal in the late twenty-first century as given by a global climate model [the ECHAM5{\textendash}Max Planck Institute (MPI) model]. In this case, the different downscaling methods provide warming values with differences in the range of 1{$^\circ$}C, in agreement with the robustness significance values. Therefore, the proposed test is a promising technique for detecting lack of robustness in statistical downscaling methods applied in climate change studies.},

  abstract = {VALUE is an open European collaboration to intercompare downscaling approaches for climate change research, focusing on different validation aspects (marginal, temporal, extremes, spatial, process-based, etc.). Here we describe the participating methods and first results from the first experiment, using ``perfect'' reanalysis (and reanalysis-driven regional climate model (RCM)) predictors to assess the intrinsic performance of the methods for downscaling precipitation and temperatures over a set of 86 stations representative of the main climatic regions in Europe. This study constitutes the largest and most comprehensive to date intercomparison of statistical downscaling methods, covering the three common downscaling approaches (perfect prognosis, model output statistics{\textemdash}including bias correction{\textemdash}and weather generators) with a total of over 50 downscaling methods representative of the most common techniques. Overall, most of the downscaling methods greatly improve (reanalysis or RCM) raw model biases and no approach or technique seems to be superior in general, because there is a large method-to-method variability. The main factors most influencing the results are the seasonal calibration of the methods (e.g., using a moving window) and their stochastic nature. The particular predictors used also play an important role in cases where the comparison was possible, both for the validation results and for the strength of the predictor{\textendash}predictand link, indicating the local variability explained. However, the present study cannot give a conclusive assessment of the skill of the methods to simulate regional future climates, and further experiments will be soon performed in the framework of the EURO-CORDEX initiative (where VALUE activities have merged and follow on). Finally, research transparency and reproducibility has been a major concern and substantive steps have been taken. In particular, the necessary data to run the experiments are provided at http://www.value-cost.eu/data and data and validation results are available from the VALUE validation portal for further investigation: http://www.value-cost.eu/validationportal.},

  abstract = {This review paper examines thermal conditions (active layer and permafrost), internal composition (rock and ice components), kinematics and rheology of creeping perennially frozen slopes in cold mountain areas. The aim is to assemble current information about creep in permafrost and rock glaciers from diverse published sources into a single paper that will be useful in studies of the flow and deformation of subsurface ice and their surface manifestations not only on Earth, but also on Mars. Emphasis is placed on quantitative information from drilling, borehole measurements, geophysical soundings, photogrammetry, laboratory experiments, etc. It is evident that quantitative holistic treatment of permafrost creep and rock glaciers requires consideration of: (a) rock weathering, snow avalanches and rockfall, with grain-size sorting on scree slopes; (b) freezing processes and ice formation in scree at sub-zero temperatures containing abundant fine material as well as coarse-grained blocks; (c) coupled thermohydro-mechanical aspects of creep and failure processes in frozen rock debris; (d) kinematics of non-isotropic, heterogeneous and layered, ice-rich permafrost on slopes with long transport paths for coarse surface material from the headwall to the front and, in some cases, subsequent re-incorporation into an advancing rock glacier causing corresponding age inversion at depth; and (e) the dynamics of rock glaciers, which include spatial and temporal variations in velocity that are manifested in the ridges, furrows and other surface structures typical of rock glaciers, as well as their down-valley motion.

Through their proximity to phase-change thresholds, they are strongly linked to climatic conditions and presently subject to rapid changes induced by ongoing trends of global warming. Hazards, risks, and disasters related to snow and ice not only result from direct impacts on humans and their infrastructure by, for instance, snow avalanches, floods from glacial lakes, or accelerated erosion of permafrost coasts, but they are also a consequence of the expansion of human activities into previously avoided dangerous regions, such as new shipping routes in the polar ocean, or tourist installations in cold mountains that are becoming ice-free. The loss of goods and benefits from reducing or even vanishing cryosphere components constitutes serious hazards to human well-being through, for example, diminishing meltwater supply in high-mountain rivers during dry seasons or rising global sea level. As ongoing changes in cases involve long-term commitments, corresponding future consequences are inevitable and irreversible at societal timescales. Further protection, mitigation, and adaptation procedures, combined with modern observational technologies will be required to anticipate, monitor, and deal with the challenges created by complex and highly interconnected snow- and ice-related geo- and ecosystems under the conditions of growing disequilibrium.},

  abstract = {We explore the changes in wind energy resources in northern Europe using output from historical to mid-21st century CMIP6 simulations and the high-emission SSP5-8.5 scenario. This study improves upon many assumptions made in the past. First, we interpolate the winds to hub height using model-level raw data; second, we use a large ensemble of CMIP6 models; third, we consider the possible wake effects on the annual energy production of a large wind farm cluster proposed for the North Sea. The common practice of extrapolating 10 m wind speeds to turbine height using the power law with a constant shear exponent is often a poor approximation of the actual turbine-height wind speed. This approximation can exaggerate the future changes in wind resources and ignore possible surface roughness and atmospheric stability changes. The evaluation of the wind climatologies in the CMIP6 models over the North Sea for the historical period shows good correspondence with measurements from tall masts and three reanalysis data points for 16 of the 18 models. Some of the models run at relatively high spatial resolution are as good as the reanalyses at representing the wind climate in this region. Our results show that annual mean wind speed and wind resources in northern Europe are not particularly affected by climate change in 2031{\textendash}2050 relative to 1995{\textendash}2014, according to a subset of 16 models in the CMIP6 collection. However, the seasonal distribution of these resources is significantly altered. Most models agree on reductions in the future wind in summer in a band that extends from the British Isles to the Baltic Sea and on increases in winter in the southern Baltic Sea. The energy production calculations show that summer energy production in a planned large wind farm cluster in the North Sea could be reduced by a median of 6.9 \% during 2031{\textendash}2050 when taking into account the wind farm wakes (that accounts for -0.7 \%) and the changes in air density (that account for -0.9 \%).},

  abstract = {[1]~In mountainous landscapes the role of periglacial processes in producing sediment is poorly defined, despite evidence of abundant talus slopes. Ice growth in rock has long been recognized as an efficient erosion mechanism, but the effects have not been readily applied to landscape evolution in response to tectonic and climatic forcing. Here, we quantify how and where ice-driven mechanical erosion occurs in cold, bedrock-dominated landscapes using a simple one-dimensional numerical heat flow model. In our model, ice grows by water migration to colder regions in shallow rock by the reduction in chemical potential associated with intermolecular forces between ice and mineral surfaces, a process called segregation ice growth. The depth and intensity of frost cracking is primarily dependent on mean annual temperature (MAT), with positive MAT sites characterized by intense cracking in the top meter of the rock mass and a maximum frost penetration of {$\sim$}4 m. In contrast, negative MAT areas have less intense cracking that primarily occurs at depths between 50 and 800 cm. We compare the depth and intensity of frost cracking predicted by our model with measures of the intensity of frost processes determined in three studies: The first measured the timing of rockfall in the Canadian Rockies, Niagara Escarpment, and Japanese Alps; the second analyzed scree deposits in the Southern Alps, New Zealand; and the third documented rockfall frequency in Utah. These natural examples show that rockfalls tend to nucleate at elevations that coincide with zones of intense frost cracking predicted by our model. As such, climatic variations associated with interglacial-glacial cycles may impart a significant influence on the denudation of mountainous landscapes.},

  abstract = {Glaciated passive margins display dramatic fjord coasts, but also commonly retain plateau fragments inland. It has been proposed recently that such elevated, low-relief surfaces on the Norwegian margin are products of highly efficient and extensive glacial and periglacial erosion (the glacial buzzsaw) operating at equilibrium line altitudes (ELAs). We demonstrate here that glacial erosion has acted instead to dissect plateaus in western Norway. Low-relief surfaces are not generally spatially associated with cirques, and do not correlate regionally with modern and Last Glacial Maximum ELAs. Glacier dynamics require instead that glacial erosion is selective, with low-relief surfaces representing islands of limited Pleistocene erosion. Deep glacial erosion of the coast and inner shelf has provided huge volumes of sediment (70,000 km3), largely resolving apparent mismatches (65{\textendash}100,000 km3) between fjord and valley volumes and Pliocene{\textendash}Pleistocene sediment wedges offshore. Nonetheless, as Pleistocene glacial valleys and cirques are cut into preexisting mountain relief, tectonics rather than isostatic compensation for glacial erosion have been the main driver for late Cenozoic uplift on the Norwegian passive margin.},

The rate of global warming is slower in the past decade than in the prior three decades. Slower growth of net climate forcings and cooling in the tropical Pacific Ocean both contribute to the slower warming rate, with the latter probably the more important effect. The tropical Pacific cooling is probably unforced variability, at least in large part. The trend toward an increased frequency of extreme hot summer anomalies over land areas has continued despite the Pacific Ocean cooling. The ``bell curves'' for observed temperature anomalies show that, because of larger unforced variability in winter, it is more difficult in winter than in summer to recognize the effect of global warming on the occurrence of extreme warm or cold seasons. It appears that there is substantial likelihood of an El Ni{\~n}o beginning in 2014, and as a result a probable record global temperature in 2014 or 2015.},

  abstract = {Open-access global Digital Elevation Models (DEM) have been crucial in enabling flood studies in data-sparse areas. Poor resolution ({$>$}30 m), significant vertical errors and the fact that these DEMs are over a decade old continue to hamper our ability to accurately estimate flood hazard. The limited availability of high-accuracy DEMs dictate that dated open-access global DEMs are still used extensively in flood models, particularly in data-sparse areas. Nevertheless, high-accuracy DEMs have been found to give better flood estimations, and thus can be considered a `must-have' for any flood model. A high-accuracy open-access global DEM is not imminent, meaning that editing or stochastic simulation of existing DEM data will remain the primary means of improving flood simulation. This article provides an overview of errors in some of the most widely used DEM data sets, along with the current advances in reducing them via the creation of new DEMs, editing DEMs and stochastic simulation of DEMs. We focus on a geostatistical approach to stochastically simulate floodplain DEMs from several open-access global DEMs based on the spatial error structure. This DEM simulation approach enables an ensemble of plausible DEMs to be created, thus avoiding the spurious precision of using a single DEM and enabling the generation of probabilistic flood maps. Despite this encouraging step, an imprecise and outdated global DEM is still being used to simulate elevation. To fundamentally improve flood estimations, particularly in rapidly changing developing regions, a high-accuracy open-access global DEM is urgently needed, which in turn can be used in DEM simulation.},

Recently, TanDEM-X 90 has been released with a global coverage at 3 arc sec resolution. Its release is sure to generate keen interest as it provides an alternative to the widely used Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM, especially for flood risk management as for low slope floodplains height errors can become particularly significant. Here, we provide a first accuracy assessment of TanDEM-X 90 for selected floodplain sites and compare it to other popular global DEMs {\textendash} the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and the error-reduced version of SRTM called Multi-Error-Removed-Improved-Terrain (MERIT) DEM. We characterize vertical height errors by comparing against high resolution LiDAR DEMs for 32 floodplain locations in 6 continents. Results indicate that the average vertical accuracy of TanDEM-X 90 and MERIT are similar and are both a significant improvement on SRTM. We further our analysis by assessing vertical accuracy by landcover, with our results suggesting that TanDEM-X 90 is the most accurate global DEM in all landcover categories tested except short vegetation and tree-covered areas where MERIT is demonstrably more accurate. Lastly, we present the first characterization of the spatial error structure of any TanDEM-X DEM product, and find the spatial error structure is similar to MERIT, with MERIT generally having lower sill values and larger ranges than TanDEM-X 90 and SRTM. Our findings suggest that TanDEM-X 90 has the potential to become the benchmark global DEM in floodplains with careful removal of errors from vegetation, and at this stage should be used alongside MERIT in any flood risk application.},

High-resolution snow depth data and statistical methods can reveal some characteristics of the subgrid variability of snow depth, which can be useful in developing models for representing such subgrid variability. In this study, snow depth was measured by airborne Lidar at 0.5-m resolution over two mountainous areas in south-western Wyoming, Snowy Range and Laramie Range. To characterize subgrid snow depth spatial distribution, measured snow depth data of these two areas were meshed into 284 grids of 1-km {\texttimes} 1-km. Also, nine representative grids of 1-km {\texttimes} 1-km were selected for detailed analyses on the geostatistical structure and probability density function of snow depth. It was verified that land cover is one of the important factors controlling spatial variability of snow depth at the 1-km scale. Probability density functions of snow depth tend to be Gaussian distributions in the forest areas. However, they are eventually skewed as non-Gaussian distribution, largely due to the no-snow areas effect, mainly caused by snow redistribution and snow melt. Our findings show the characteristics of subgrid variability of snow depth and clarify the potential factors that need to be considered in modelling subgrid variability of snow depth.},

  abstract = {Threshold wind speed for snow movement is one of the most important parameters describing the wind-transport snow process. A majority of previous studies used empirical and constant threshold wind speeds while the variations of atmosphere condition and snow age seem to greatly affect the snow settlement process. This study tested the hypothesis that the threshold wind speed for snow transport increases as deposition time passed since last snowfall by introducing a new formula of the threshold wind speed for snow movement. It was theoretically derived based on the sintering process modeling and the moment balance of a snow particle. Through this formula, the influences of snow particle size, temperature, and deposition time on the threshold wind speed were explicitly taken into consideration. However, two empirical parameters in the sintering process modeling remained in the new formula, and they were determined by a calibration-validation procedure using the field observed snow flux data. The snow flux and meteorological data collected at the ISAW stations (http://www.iav.ch) including large number of snow transport events during five winter seasons were used to test this formula. It was shown that the new formula qualitatively described the threshold wind speed required for the incipient motion of snow under various conditions in the natural environment of the Alps.},

  abstract = {A physically based subgrid variability model for snow process using the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) approach was proposed. This FPE can express the evolution of the probability density function (PDF) of snow depth within a finite area, possibly a grid cell of distributed models or a small basin, whose shape can be irregular. The main advantage of this approach is that it does not rely on a given PDF but dynamically computes the PDF through an advection-diffusion-type equation, the FPE, which was derived from point-scale process-based governing equations. Snow depth was treated as a random variable, while the snow redistribution and snowmelt rate were treated as the sources of stochasticity. The main challenge in solving this FPE is evaluating the time-space covariances appearing in the diffusion coefficient. In this study, approximations to evaluate the covariance terms, accounting for snowmelt and snow redistribution, were proposed. The simulated results of the FPE model were validated by the measured time series of snow depth at one site and the spatial distributions of snow depth measured by ground penetrating radar and airborne light detection and ranging (Lidar). It was shown that the point-observed snow depth fell within the simulated range during most of the 2-year study period. The simulated PDFs of snow depth within the study area were similar to the observed PDFs of snow depth by ground penetrating radar and Lidar. In summary, these results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed FPE model representing the subgrid variability of snow depth.},

  abstract = {Machine learning models, such as neural networks, decision trees, random forests and gradient boosting machines accept a feature vector and provide a prediction. These models learn in a supervised fashion where a set of feature vectors with expected output is provided. It is very common practice to engineer new features from the provided feature set. Such engineered features will either augment, or replace portions of the existing feature vector. These engineered features are essentially calculated fields, based on the values of the other features. Engineering such features is primarily a manual, time-consuming task. Additionally, each type of model will respond differently to different types of engineered features. This paper reports on empirical research to demonstrate what types of engineered features are best suited to which machine learning model type. This is accomplished by generating several datasets that are designed to benefit from a particular type of engineered feature. The experiment demonstrates to what degree the machine learning model is capable of synthesizing the needed feature on its own. If a model is capable of synthesizing an engineered feature, it is not necessary to provide that feature. The research demonstrated that the studied models do indeed perform differently with various types of engineered features.},

While measurements from these sites have provided a wealth of information, various studies have questioned the representativity of such flat field snow depth measurements for the surrounding topography, especially in alpine regions. In this study, we used highly resolved snow depth maps at peak of winter from two distinct climatic regions in eastern Switzerland and in the Spanish Pyrenees to develop a mean snow depth parameterization for large-scale model applications over complex topography based on flat field snow depth measurements and easy to derive topographical parameters. Removing the elevation dependent gradient in mean snow depth revealed remaining topographic correlations with the sky view factor. We performed a scale dependent analysis for domain sizes to specify error statistics inherent in large-scale grid cell sizes. Overall, our results show that correlations between subgrid terrain characteristics and mean snow depth increase with increasing domain size. As the parameterization is independent of a specific geographic region it could be used to assimilate flat field snow depth measurements into large-scale snow model frameworks.},

Various measurement networks were therefore developed to measure snow depth on the ground. Measurement stations are generally located in gentle terrain (flat field measurements) most often at lower or mid elevation. While these sites have provided a wealth of information, various studies have questioned the representativity of such flat field measurements for the surrounding topography, especially in alpine regions. Using highly resolved snow depth maps at the peak of winter from two distinct climatic regions in Switzerland and in the Spanish Pyrenees, we developed two parameterizations to estimate domain-averaged snow depth in coarse-scale model applications over complex topography using easy to derive topographic parameters. The first parameterization uses a commonly applied linear lapse rate. Removing the dominant elevation gradient in mean snow depth revealed remaining underlying correlations with other topographic parameters, in particular the sky view factor. The second parameterization combines a power law elevation trend scaled with the subgrid parameterized sky view factor. Using a variety of statistic measures showed that the more complex parameterization performs better when using mean high-resolution flat field snow depth. The performances slightly decreased when formulating the parameterizations for a single flat field snow depth measurement. Nevertheless, the more complex parameterization still outperformed the linear lapse rate model. As the parameterization was developed independently of a specific geographic region, we suggest it could be used to assimilate flat field snow depth or snowfall into coarse-scale snow model frameworks.},

Therefore, understanding how the production of sediments by glacial erosion has evolved in the past, and will evolve in a changing climate, is increasingly important. In this Review, we examine the processes that control the magnitude and timing of glacial erosion of mountains, and how models can be used to reconstruct processes during the development of mountains. Field observations reveal the important role of sliding on the erosion rate, which provide an empirical basis to explain the glacial buzzsaw and the impact of late Cenozoic cooling on erosion rates. Glacial erosion is also expected to evolve in the context of anthropogenic climate warming, as both glacier sliding and the input of meltwater related to thinning and retreat of ice will change, with large effects on downstream ecosystems and global biogeochemical cycles. Thus, the mechanics and impacts of glaciers on sediment production warrant more research, especially in regions experiencing rapid warming. Above all, there is a need for better monitoring of how erosion rates changed over the last decades and will evolve in the future.},

  abstract = {The climate change impact and adaptation communities need future scenarios with sufficient high resolution, which are frequently achieved by applying Statistical Downscaling Models (SDMs) over Global Climate Models. A large variety of SDMs exists, and some can be more suitable than others for each specific purpose. For this reason, it is important to develop tools to facilitate the evaluation and generation of downscaled scenarios following different approaches. In this paper we present a service, `pyClim-SDM', which allows users to generate and evaluate their own downscaled scenarios with a very simple and user-friendly graphical interface. This tool includes a large collection of  state-of-the-art  methods belonging to different families to downscale daily data of the following surface variables: temperature, precipitation, wind, relative humidity and cloud coverage. Additionally, the software is prepared to be applied over any other user-defined target variable. Thus, multivariable indexes can be tackled as target variables themselves, instead of being calculated from the downscaled primary variables. With this possibility, potential intervariable inconsistencies are avoided. An application example for a Fire Weather Index, dependent on temperature, wind, humidity and precipitation, is shown. The service here presented -mainly based on a new downscaling software and a friendly graphical user interface- is an essential piece for evaluating and generating high-resolution projection data within the Spanish national climate change adaptation strategy which includes, among other elements, a common database for all sectors, viewer and data distribution portal, etc.},

  abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31\,km, compared to 80\,km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10\,hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

A transient one-dimensional heat flow model was used to simulate ground temperatures and associated active layer thicknesses for nine borehole locations, which are located at different elevations and in substrates with different thermal properties. The model was forced by reconstructed air temperatures starting from 1860, which approximately coincides with the end of the Little Ice Age in the region. The impact of climate warming on mountain permafrost to 2100 is assessed by using downscaled air temperatures from a multi-model ensemble for the A1B scenario. Borehole records over three consecutive years of ground temperatures, air temperatures and snow cover data served for model calibration and validation. With an increase of air temperature of {$\sim$}1.5 ‚ó¶C over 1860{\textendash}2010 and an additional warming of {$\sim$}2.8 ‚ó¶C until 2100, we simulate the evolution of ground temperatures for each borehole location. In 1860 the lower limit of permafrost was estimated to be ca. 200 m lower than observed today. According to the model, since the approximate end of the Little Ice Age, the active-layer thickness has increased by 0.5{\textendash}5 m and {$>$}10 m for the sites Juvvassh{\o}e and Tron, respectively. The most pronounced increases in active layer thickness were modelled for the last two decades since 1990 with increase rates of +2 cm yr-1 to +87 cm yr-1 (20{\textendash}430 \%). According to the A1B climate scenario, degradation of mountain permafrost is suggested to occur throughout the 21st century at most of the sites below ca. 1800 m a.s.l. At the highest locations at 1900 m a.s.l., permafrost degradation is likely to occur with a probability of 55{\textendash}75 \% by 2100. This implies that mountain permafrost in southern Norway is likely to be confined to the highest peaks in the western part of the country.},

  abstract = {Global climate models (GCMs) are commonly downscaled to understand future local climate change. The high computational cost of regional climate models (RCMs) limits how many GCMs can be dynamically downscaled, restricting uncertainty assessment. While statistical downscaling is cheaper, its validity in a changing climate is unclear. We combine these approaches to build an emulator leveraging the merits of dynamical and statistical downscaling. A machine learning model is developed for each coarse grid cell to predict fine grid variables, using coarse-scale climate predictors with fine grid land characteristics. Two RCM emulators, one Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and one Multiple Linear Regression error-reduced with Random Forest (MLR-RF), are developed to downscale daily evapotranspiration from 12.5 km (coarse-scale) to 1.5 km (fine-scale). Out-of-sample tests for the MLP and MLR-RF achieve Kling-Gupta-Efficiency of 0.86 and 0.83, correlation of 0.89 and 0.86, and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.78 and 0.75, with a relative bias of -6\% to 5\% and -5\% to 4\%, respectively. Using histogram match for spatial efficiency, both emulators achieve a median score of {$\sim$}0.77. This is generally better than a common statistical downscaling method in a range of metrics. Additionally, through ``spatial transitivity,'' we can downscale GCMs for new regions at negligible cost and only minor performance loss. The framework offers a cheap and quick way to downscale large ensembles of GCMs. This could enable high-resolution climate projections from a larger number of global models, enabling uncertainty quantification, and so better support for resilience and adaptation planning.},

  abstract = {The existence of large late-glacial ice-dammed lakes in Mid-Norway was recognised in the late 1800s. Mapping of the lakes' distribution provided novel and valuable information regarding ice age palaeogeography and glacial isostatic adjustment, but the findings failed to convince the scientific community at the time. Divergent opinions concerning the inland lakes have lingered to the present, in particular as the purported glacial lake shorelines have been interpreted as subglacial or lateral meltwater features. In this study we revisit the largest palaeolake-glacial lake Nedre Glomsj{\o}-and attempt to unravel the controversy using high-resolution airborne LiDAR data. Our mapping has revealed key and hitherto undescribed landforms indicative of an open lake system. De Geer moraines signal that the ice sheet retreated in a water-body corresponding to the elevation of the Nedre Glomsj{\o} shorelines. The De Geer moraines also determine that the ice sheet in the region did not merely melt vertically down, but rather retreated actively southward, and we thus refute studies claiming that the purported shorelines formed along a closed ice-filled basin with stagnant ice. Based on the number of De Geer moraines, the ice-sheet margin is estimated to have retreated step-wise through our study area at a rate of 200-600 m yr-1. The study highlights the potential of mapping glacial lake remnants for assessing palaeoglaciology in an ambiguous sector of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet.},

  abstract = {Measures for the accuracy assessment of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are discussed and characteristics of DEMs derived from laser scanning and automated photogrammetry are presented. Such DEMs are very dense and relatively accurate in open terrain. Built-up and wooded areas, however, need automated filtering and classification in order to generate terrain (bare earth) data when Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) have to be produced. Automated processing of the raw data is not always successful. Systematic errors and many outliers at both methods (laser scanning and digital photogrammetry) may therefore be present in the data sets. We discuss requirements for the reference data with respect to accuracy and propose robust statistical methods as accuracy measures. Their use is illustrated by application at four practical examples. It is concluded that measures such as median, normalized median absolute deviation, and sample quantiles should be used in the accuracy assessment of such DEMs. Furthermore, the question is discussed how large a sample size is needed in order to obtain sufficiently precise estimates of the new accuracy measures and relevant formulae are presented.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The combination of numerical weather prediction and snowpack models has potential to provide valuable information about snow avalanche conditions in remote areas. However, the output of snowpack models is sensitive to precipitation inputs, which can be difficult to verify in mountainous regions. To examine how existing observation networks can help interpret the accuracy of snowpack models, we compared snow depths predicted by a weather{\textendash}snowpack model chain with data from automated weather stations and manual observations. Data from the 2020{\textendash}2021 winter were compiled for 21 avalanche forecast regions across western Canada covering a range of climates and observation networks. To perform regional-scale comparisons, SNOWPACK model simulations were run at select grid points from the High-Resolution Deterministic Prediction System (HRDPS) numerical weather prediction model to represent conditions at treeline elevations, and observed snow depths were upscaled to the same locations. Snow depths in the Coast Mountain range were systematically overpredicted by the model, while snow depths in many parts of the interior Rocky Mountain range were underpredicted. These discrepancies had a greater impact on simulated snowpack conditions in the interior ranges, where faceting was more sensitive to snow depth. To put the comparisons in context, the quality of the upscaled observations was assessed by checking whether snow depth changes during stormy periods were consistent with the forecast avalanche hazard. While some regions had high-quality observations, other regions were poorly represented by available observations, suggesting in some situations modelled snow depths could be more reliable than observations. The analysis provides insights into the potential for validating weather and snowpack models with readily available observations, as well as for how avalanche forecasters can better interpret the accuracy of snowpack simulations.},

Then, three machine learning methods, i.e., Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest Regression (RFR), were used to produce a fused snow depth dataset from 2002 to 2004. The RFR model performed best and was thus used to produce a new snow depth product from the fusion of the five snow depth datasets and auxiliary data over the Northern Hemisphere from 2002 to 2011. The fused snow-depth product was verified at five well-known snow observation sites. The R2 of Sodankyl{\"a}, Old Aspen, and Reynolds Mountains East were 0.88, 0.69, and 0.63, respectively. At the Swamp Angel Study Plot and Weissfluhjoch observation sites, which have an average snow depth exceeding 200 cm, the fused snow depth did not perform well. The spatial patterns of the average snow depth were analyzed seasonally, and the average snow depths of autumn, winter, and spring were 5.7, 25.8, and 21.5 cm, respectively. In the future, random forest regression will be used to produce a long time series of a fused snow depth dataset over the Northern Hemisphere or other specific regions.},

Here, we provide the theoretical foundation for deriving snow depth directly from space-borne lidar (ICESat-2) snow multiple scattering measurements for the first time. First, based on the Monte Carlo lidar radiative transfer simulations of ICESat-2 measurements of 532-nm laser light propagation in snow, we find that the lidar backscattering path length follows Gamma distribution. Next, we derive three simple analytical equations to compute snow depth from the average, second-, and thirdorder moments of the distribution. As a preliminary application, these relations are then used to retrieve snow depth over the Antarctic ice sheet and the Arctic sea ice using the ICESat-2 lidar multiple scattering measurements. The robustness of this snow depth technique is demonstrated by the agreement of snow depth computed from the three derived relations using both modeled data and ICESat-2 observations.},

Modeling renewable energy potential, such as wind energy, typically involves the use of wind speed time series in the modeling process. One of the most widely utilized datasets in this regard is ERA5, which provides global meteorological information. Despite its broad coverage, the coarse spatial resolution of ERA5 data presents challenges in examining local-scale effects on energy systems, such as battery storage for small-scale wind farms or community energy systems. In this study, we introduce a robust statistical downscaling approach that utilizes a machine learning approach to improve the resolution of ERA5 wind speed data from around 31 km {\texttimes} 31 km to 1 km {\texttimes} 1 km. To ensure optimal results, a comprehensive preprocessing step is performed to classify regions into three classes based on the quality of ERA5 wind speed estimates. Subsequently, a regression method is applied to each class to downscale the ERA5 wind speed time series by considering the relationship between ERA5 data, observations from weather stations, and topographic metrics. Our results indicate that this approach significantly improves the performance of ERA5 wind speed data in complex terrain. To ensure the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, we also perform thorough evaluations by comparing our results with the reference dataset COSMO-REA6 and validating with independent datasets.},

The time-slice maps of ice-sheet extent are based on a new Geographical Information System (GIS) database, where we have collected published numerical dates constraining the timing of ice-sheet advance and retreat, and additionally geomorphological and geological evidence contained within the existing literature. We integrate all uncertainty estimates into three ice-margin lines for each time-slice; a most-credible line, derived from our assessment of all available evidence, with bounding maximum and minimum limits allowed by existing data. This approach was motivated by the demands of glaciological, isostatic and climate modelling and to clearly display limitations in knowledge. The timing of advance and retreat were both remarkably spatially variable across the ice-sheet area. According to our compilation the westernmost limit along the British{\textendash}Irish and Norwegian continental shelf was reached up to 7000 years earlier (at c. 27{\textendash}26 ka) than the eastern limit on the Russian Plain (at c. 20{\textendash}19 ka). The Eurasian ice sheet complex as a whole attained its maximum extent (5.5 Mkm2) and volume ({\textasciitilde}24 m Sea Level Equivalent) at c. 21 ka. Our continental-scale approach highlights instances of conflicting evidence and gaps in the ice-sheet chronology where uncertainties remain large and should be a focus for future research. Largest uncertainties coincide with locations presently below sea level and where contradicting evidence exists.

  abstract = {Glaciers distinct from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are shrinking rapidly, altering regional hydrology1, raising global sea level2 and elevating natural hazards3. Yet, owing to the scarcity of constrained mass loss observations, glacier evolution during the satellite era is known only partially, as a geographic and temporal patchwork4,5. Here we reveal the accelerated, albeit contrasting, patterns of glacier mass loss during the early twenty-first century. Using largely untapped satellite archives, we chart surface elevation changes at a high spatiotemporal resolution over all of Earth's glaciers. We extensively validate our estimates against independent, high-precision measurements and present a globally complete and consistent estimate of glacier mass change. We show that during 2000{\textendash}2019, glaciers lost a mass of 267~{$\pm~$}16 gigatonnes per year, equivalent to 21~{$\pm~$}3 per cent of the observed sea-level rise6. We identify a mass loss acceleration of 48~{$\pm~$}16 gigatonnes per year per decade, explaining 6 to 19 per cent of the observed acceleration of sea-level rise. Particularly, thinning rates of glaciers outside ice sheet peripheries doubled over the past two decades. Glaciers currently lose more mass, and at similar or larger acceleration rates, than the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets taken separately7{\textendash}9. By uncovering the patterns of mass change in many regions, we find contrasting glacier fluctuations that agree with the decadal variability in precipitation and temperature. These include a North Atlantic anomaly of decelerated mass loss, a strongly accelerated loss from northwestern American glaciers, and the apparent end of the Karakoram anomaly of mass gain10. We anticipate our highly resolved estimates to advance the understanding of drivers that govern the distribution of glacier change, and to extend our capabilities of predicting these changes at all scales. Predictions robustly benchmarked against observations are critically needed to design adaptive policies for the local- and regional-scale management of water resources and cryospheric risks, as well as for the global-scale mitigation of sea-level rise.},

Surface elevation observations are being used across an expanding range of fields to study topographical attributes and their changes over time, notably in glaciology, hydrology, volcanology, seismology, forestry, and geomorphology. However, DEMs frequently contain large-scale instrument noise and varying vertical precision that lead to complex patterns of errors. Here, we present a validated statistical workflow to estimate, model, and propagate uncertainties in DEMs. We review the state-of-the-art of DEM accuracy and precision analyses, and define a conceptual framework to consistently address those. We show how to characterize DEM precision by quantifying the heteroscedasticity of elevation measurements, i.e., varying vertical precision with terrain- or sensor-dependent variables, and the spatial correlation of errors that can occur across multiple spatial scales. With the increasing availability of high-precision observations, our workflow based on independent elevation data acquired on stable terrain can be applied almost anywhere on Earth. We illustrate how to propagate uncertainties for both pixel-scale and spatial elevation derivatives, using terrain slope and glacier volume changes as examples. We find that uncertainties in DEMs are largely underestimated in the literature, and advocate that new metrics of DEM precision are essential to ensure the reliability of future land elevation assessments.},

  abstract = {Bias correction methods are developed based on the assumption that the biases of climate model outputs are stationary, that is, the characteristics of the bias are constant over time. However, recent studies have shown the biases are not always stationary. The objectives of this study are to investigate the impacts of bias nonstationarity of climate-model-simulated precipitation and temperature on future climate projections, and the roles of internal climate variability (ICV) and climate model sensitivity (CMS) in bias nonstationarity. A pseudoreality approach is used in this study, in which each of the 24 climate model simulations is alternately selected as a reference to estimate the biases (defined as pseudobias to distinguish it from actual bias estimated by observations) of 23 other simulations. The absolute ratio of the change in pseudobias between two periods to the corresponding climate change signal is calculated to assess the impacts of bias nonstationarity on future climate projections. Furthermore, the roles of ICV and CMS are investigated by comparing the changes in pseudobias between historical and future periods relative to the baseline period. The results show that biases of climate-model-simulated mean annual and seasonal temperature and precipitation vary with time. Bias nonstationarity of temperature is not significant in future temperature projections, while the bias nonstationarity of precipitation plays an important role in future precipitation projections. In addition, the contributions of ICV and CMS to bias nonstationarity are both relatively small for temperature, even though the latter contributes slightly more than the former. However, ICV makes a large contribution to the bias nonstationarity of precipitation for the historical period. In the far future period, the role of CMS is as important as ICV. These results imply that the impacts of ICV and CMS may need to be considered when developing and evaluating a bias correction method, especially for precipitation projections.},

However, this assumption may not be valid, because of the natural climate variability. This study investigates the impacts of bias nonstationarity of climate models simulated precipitation and temperature on hydrological climate change impact studies. The bias nonstationarity is determined as the range of difference in bias over multiple historical periods with no anthropogenic climate change for four different time windows. The role of bias nonstationarity in future climate change is assessed using the signal-to-noise ratio as a criterion. The results show that biases of climate models simulated monthly and annual precipitation and temperature vary with time, especially for short time windows. The bias nonstationarity of precipitation plays a great role in future precipitation change, while the role of temperature bias is not important. The bias nonstationarity of climate model outputs is amplified when driving a hydrological model for hydrological simulations. The increase in the length of time window can mitigate the impacts of bias nonstationarity for streamflow projections. Thus, a long time period is suggested to be used to calibrate a bias correction method for hydrological climate change impact studies to reduce the influence of natural climate variability.},

Warmer temperatures decrease the amount of montane snow water equivalent (SWE), forcing its center of mass to higher elevations. We use a unique multivariate probabilistic framework to quantify the response of the 1 April SWE volume and its centroid to a 1.0 to 2.0 {$^\circ$}C increase in winter air temperature across the Sierra Nevada (United States). A 1.0 {$^\circ$}C increase reduces the probability of exceeding the long-term (1985{\textendash}2016) average rangewide SWE volume (15.7 km3) by 20.7\%. It correspondingly is 60.6\% more likely for the centroid to be higher than its long-term average (2,540 m). We further show that a 1.5 and 2.0 {$^\circ$}C increase in the winter temperature reduces the probability of exceeding the long-term average SWE volume by 31.0\% and 41.1\%, respectively, whereas it becomes 79.3\% and 89.8\% more likely that the centroid will be higher than 2,540 m for those respective temperature changes. We also characterize regional variability across the Sierra Nevada and show that the northwestern and southeastern regions of the mountain range are 30.3\% and 14.0\% less likely to have 1 April SWE volumes exceed their long-term average for a 1.0 {$^\circ$}C increase about their respective average winter temperatures. Overall, the SWE in the northern Sierra Nevada exhibits higher hydrologic vulnerability to warming than in the southern region. Given the expected increases in mountain temperatures, the observed rates of change in SWE are expected to intensify in the future.},

Changes in the duration and intensity of droughts can significantly impact ecosystems, food and water security, agriculture, hydropower, and the socioeconomics of a region. We characterize the duration and intensity of snow droughts (snow water equivalent deficits) worldwide and differences in their distributions over 1980 to 2018. We find that snow droughts became more prevalent, intensified, and lengthened across the western United States (WUS). Eastern Russia, Europe, and the WUS emerged as hot spots for snow droughts, experiencing {$\sim$}2, 16, and 28\% longer snow drought durations, respectively, in the latter half of 1980 to 2018. In this second half of the record, these regions exhibited a higher probability (relative to the first half of the record) of having a snow drought exceed the average intensity from the first period by 3, 4, and 15\%. The Hindu Kush and Central Asia, extratropical Andes, greater Himalayas, and Patagonia, however, experienced decreases (percent changes) in the average snow drought duration (-4, -7, -8, and -16\%, respectively). Although we do not attempt to separate natural and human influences with a detailed attribution analysis, we discuss some relevant physical processes (e.g., Arctic amplification and polar vortex movement) that likely contribute to observed changes in snow drought characteristics. We also demonstrate how our framework can facilitate drought monitoring and assessment by examining two snow deficits that posed large socioeconomic challenges in the WUS (2014/2015) and Afghanistan (2017/2018).},

  abstract = {Global warming is expected to significantly affect the runoff regime of mountainous catchments. Simple methods for calculating future glacier change in hydrological models are required in order to reliably assess economic impacts of changes in the water cycle over the next decades. Models for temporal and spatial glacier evolution need to describe the climate forcing acting on the glacier, and ice flow dynamics. Flow models, however, demand considerable computational resources and field data input and are moreover not applicable on the regional scale. Here, we propose a simple parameterization for calculating the change in glacier surface elevation and area, which is mass conserving and suited for hydrological modelling. The {$\Delta$}h-parameterization is an empirical glacier-specific function derived from observations in the past that can easily be applied to large samples of glaciers. We compare the {$\Delta$}h-parameterization to results of a 3-D finite-element ice flow model. As case studies, the evolution of two Alpine glaciers of different size over the period 2008{\textendash}2100 is investigated using regional climate scenarios. The parameterization closely reproduces the distributed ice thickness change, as well as glacier area and length predicted by the ice flow model. This indicates that for the purpose of transient runoff forecasts, future glacier geometry change can be approximated using a simple parameterization instead of complex ice flow modelling. Furthermore, we analyse alpine glacier response to 21st century climate change and consequent shifts in the runoff regime of a highly glacierized catchment using the proposed methods.},

Here, we present a new model for calculating the twenty-first century mass changes of all glaciers on Earth outside the ice sheets. The Global Glacier Evolution Model (GloGEM) includes mass loss due to frontal ablation at marine-terminating glacier fronts and accounts for glacier advance/retreat and surface elevation changes. Simulations are driven with monthly near-surface air temperature and precipitation from 14 Global Circulation Models forced by RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. Depending on the scenario, the model yields a global glacier volume loss of 25{\textendash}48\% between 2010 and 2100. For calculating glacier contribution to sea-level rise, we account for ice located below sea-level presently displacing ocean water. This effect reduces the glacier contribution by 11{\textendash}14\%, so that our model predicts a sea-level equivalent (multi-model mean {$\pm$}1 standard deviation) of 79{$\pm$}24 mm (RCP2.6), 108{$\pm$}28 mm (RCP4.5), and 157{$\pm$}31 mm (RCP8.5).

They are highly sensitive and prone to climate change3,4, yet their importance and vulnerability have not been quantified at the global scale. Here we present a global water tower index (WTI), which ranks all water towers in terms of their water-supplying role and the downstream dependence of ecosystems and society. For each water tower, we assess its vulnerability related to water stress, governance, hydropolitical tension and future climatic and socio-economic changes. We conclude that the most important (highest WTI) water towers are also among the most vulnerable, and that climatic and socio-economic changes will affect them profoundly. This could negatively impact 1.9 billion people living in (0.3 billion) or directly downstream of (1.6 billion) mountainous areas. Immediate action is required to safeguard the future of the world's most important and vulnerable water towers.},

  abstract = {Tectonic inversion of rift basins is most commonly reported in the literature to occur after rifting has ceased. In contrast, we present evidence for synrift, localized tectonic inversion from the Loppa High area, southwestern Barents Sea and present a model for the formation of inversion structures as a result of differential uplift. The structures are of early Barremian to mid-Albian age (c. 131\,{\textendash}\,105\hspace{0.25em}Ma) and are focused in or near pre-existing extensional boundary faults along the margins of the Loppa High. Inversion is interpreted to be the result of uplift of the high along its inclined boundary faults, leading to space accommodation problems as uplift was not properly compensated by extension in the region. The model constrains the initiation of uplift of the Loppa High to the early Barremian and shows that the asymmetric margin configuration of the high may have led to a bulk clockwise rotation of the high around a vertical axis during uplift. The cause of uplift is not fully understood, but is suggested to be linked to contemporaneous extreme lithospheric thinning in neighbouring basins to the west. Processes involved may include isostatic flexure, thermal heating, lithological phase changes and/or far-field stresses, although these aspects need to be further tested.},

Warming has occurred at sites with cold permafrost, marginal permafrost and deep seasonal frost. Ongoing permafrost degradation is suggested both by direct temperature monitoring and indirect geophysical surveys. An increase in MGT at 6.6{\textendash}9.0-m depth was observed for most sites, ranging from {\textasciitilde}0.015 to {\textasciitilde} 0.095{$^\circ$}C a-1. The greatest rate of temperature increase was for sites having MGTs slightly above 0{$^\circ$}C. The lowest rate of increase was for marginal permafrost sites that are affected by latent heat exchange close to 0{$^\circ$}C. Increased snow depths and an increase in winter air temperatures appear to be the most important factors controlling warming observed over the ten-year period. Geophysical surveys performed in 1999 to delineate the altitudinal limit of mountain permafrost were repeated in 2009 and 2010 and indicated the degradation of some permafrost over the intervening decade.

In order to provide optimized climate scenarios for climate change impact research, this study merges linear and nonlinear empirical-statistical downscaling techniques with bias correction methods and investigates their ability for reducing RCM error characteristics. An ensemble of seven empirical-statistical downscaling and error correction methods (DECMs) is applied to post-process daily precipitation sums of a high-resolution regional climate hindcast simulation over the Alpine region, their error characteristics are analysed and compared to the raw RCM results. Drastic reductions in error characteristics due to application of DECMs are demonstrated. Direct point-wise methods like quantile mapping and local intensity scaling as well as indirect spatial methods as nonlinear analogue methods yield systematic improvements in median, variance, frequency, intensity and extremes of daily precipitation. Multiple linear regression methods, even if optimized by predictor selection, transformation and randomization, exhibit significant shortcomings for modelling daily precipitation due to their linear framework. Comparing the well-performing methods to each other, quantile mapping shows the best performance, particularly at high quantiles, which is advantageous for applications related to extreme precipitation events. The improvements are obtained regardless of season and region, which indicates the potential transferability of these methods to other regions.

  abstract = {The elevation of the mountains in Norway is geologically young. Much of the present-day land surface was buried below a thick cover of relatively young sediments in the early Miocene, 23\,Ma, when Scandinavia started to be uplifted. Big river systems eroded deeply into the rising landscape and transported sand and gravel from Norway and Sweden to Denmark where the detritus was deposited in a large delta. In Norway, the erosion formed an extensive plain near sea level that included the present-day mountain plateau of Hardangervidda and extended across a thick pile of sediments that covered the present-day coastal areas of Norway. Hardangervidda was uplifted to its present elevation of about 1200\,m after a second phase of uplift that began about 5\,Ma, in the early Pliocene. The hard bedrock of Hardangervidda has preserved this part of the plain as an elevated plateau, but the part of the plain that extended across the sediments has been eroded away, exposing the underlying basement rocks. That re-exposed basement surface was shaped in the Jurassic when the climate was warm and humid. The basement rocks were weathered where rainwater seeped into fracture zones. Erosion of the weathered rocks has left a terrain of fracture valleys and hilly relief that contrasts with the sub-horizontal plain of Hardangervidda. This weathered landscape is today exposed on the slope between the west coast and Hardangervidda. While the elevation of the mountains is young, today's landscape has a long history.},

  abstract = {On the level of decision support, most algorithmic problems encountered in machine learning are instances of pure prediction or pure automation tasks. This dissertation takes a holistic view of decision support, and begins by identifying four important problem classes that lie between the two extremes: exploration, mediation, interpretation, and generation---specifically with an eye towards the role of reinforcement learning in helping humans 'close the loop' in sequential decision-making. In particular, we focus on the problems of: exploring new environments without guidance, interpreting observed behavior from data, generating synthetic time series, and mediating between humans and machines. For each of these, we proffer novel mathematical formalisms, propose algorithmic solutions, and present empirical illustration of their utility. In the first instance, we refine our notion of curiosity-driven exploration to separate epistemic knowledge from aleatoric variation in hindsight, propose an algorithmic framework that yields a simple and scalable generalization of curiosity that is robust to all types of stochasticity, and demonstrate state-of-the-art results in a popular benchmark. In the second instance, we formalize a unifying perspective on inverse decision modeling that generalizes existing work on imitation learning and reward learning while opening up a broader class of research problems in behavior representation, and instantiate an example for learning interpretable representations of boundedly rational decision-making. In the third instance, we propose a probabilistic generative model of time-series data that optimizes a local transition policy by reinforcement from a global energy model learned by contrastive estimation, draw a rich analogy between synthetic generation and sequential imitation, and verify that it yields useful samples on real-world datasets. In the fourth instance, we formalize the sequential problem of online decision mediation with abstentive feedback, propose an effective solution that seeks to trade off immediate loss terms against future improvements in generalization error, and illustrate its efficacy relative to applicable benchmark algorithms on a variety of metrics. Like so, this dissertation contributes and advances a broader perspective on machine learning for augmenting decision-making processes.},

  abstract = {Cold content is a measure of a snowpack's energy deficit and is a linear function of snowpack mass and temperature. Positive energy fluxes into a snowpack must first satisfy the remaining energy deficit before snowmelt runoff begins, making cold content a key component of the snowpack energy budget. Nevertheless, uncertainty surrounds cold content development and its relationship to snowmelt, likely because of a lack of direct observations. This work clarifies the controls exerted by air temperature, precipitation, and negative energy fluxes on cold content development and quantifies the relationship between cold content and snowmelt timing and rate at daily to seasonal timescales. The analysis presented herein leverages a unique long-term snow pit record along with validated output from the SNOWPACK model forced with 23 water years (1991{\textendash}2013) of quality controlled, infilled hourly meteorological data from an alpine and subalpine site in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. The results indicated that precipitation exerted the primary control on cold content development at our two sites with snowfall responsible for 84.4 and 73.0\&thinsp;\% of simulated daily gains in the alpine and subalpine, respectively. A negative surface energy balance {\textendash} primarily driven by sublimation and longwave radiation emission from the snowpack {\textendash} during days without snowfall provided a secondary pathway for cold content development, and was responsible for the remaining 15.6 and 27.0\&thinsp;\% of cold content additions. Non-zero cold content values were associated with reduced snowmelt rates and delayed snowmelt onset at daily to sub-seasonal timescales, while peak cold content magnitude had no significant relationship to seasonal snowmelt timing. These results suggest that the information provided by cold content observations and/or simulations is most relevant to snowmelt processes at shorter timescales, and may help water resource managers to better predict melt onset and rate.},

Satellite radar altimetry data has been used successfully to observe water levels in lakes and (large) rivers, and has also been combined with hydrologic/hydrodynamic models. Except CryoSat-2, all radar altimetry missions have been operated in conventional low resolution mode with a short repeat orbit (35 days or less). CryoSat-2, carrying a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) altimeter, has a 369-day repeat and a drifting ground track pattern and provides new opportunities for hydrologic research. The narrow inter-track distance (7.5 km at the equator) makes it possible to monitor many lakes and rivers and SAR mode provides a finer along-track resolution, higher return power and speckle reduction through multi-looks. However, CryoSat-2 challenges conventional ways of dealing with satellite inland water altimetry data because virtual station time series cannot be directly derived for rivers. We review the CryoSat-2 mission characteristics, data products, and its use and perspectives for inland water applications. We discuss all the important steps in the workflow for hydrologic analysis with CryoSat-2, and conclude with a discussion of promising future research directions.},

Unprotected icebergs could be delivered with about 50\% yield to latitude 38{$^\circ$} S., but the rate of deterioration in the warm waters indicates that protection would be required for longer journeys. The towing simulation was most sensitive to north-south current components, the total towing distance and the rate of iceberg deterioration. Efforts directed towards locating suitable icebergs in the region 50{$^\circ$} S. to 60{$^\circ$} S., and towards increasing knowledge of the changing current patterns in the Southern Ocean would be most valuable, as would a knowledge of the mechanisms and rates of deterioration of icebergs in warm seas.                        ,              R{\'e}sum{\'e}                            On a simul{\'e} le remorquage d'icebergs non prot{\'e}g{\'e}s depuis le continent Antarctique (66{$^\circ$} S.) {\`a} la latitude 38{$^\circ$} S. en utilisant un mod{\`e}le hydrodynamique explicite en un mod{\`e}le de fusion bidimensionnel.

The novelty of IGM is that it models the ice flow by a Convolutional Neural Network, which is trained from data generated with hybrid SIA + SSA or Stokes ice flow models. By doing so, the most computationally demanding model component is substituted by a cheap emulator. Once trained with representative data, we demonstrate that IGM permits to model mountain glaciers up to 1000 {\texttimes} faster than Stokes ones on Central Processing Units (CPU) with fidelity levels above 90\% in terms of ice flow solutions leading to nearly identical transient thickness evolution. Switching to the GPU often permits additional significant speed-ups, especially when emulating Stokes dynamics or/and modelling at high spatial resolution. IGM is an open-source Python code which deals with two-dimensional (2-D) gridded input and output data. Together with a companion library of trained ice flow emulators, IGM permits user-friendly, highly efficient and mechanically state-of-the-art glacier and icefields simulations.},

Two years of temperature measurements in seven 1-m-deep profiles located in central-eastern Norway showed that mean annual ground temperatures were 1.3{\textendash}2.0{$^\circ$}C lower in block fields (felsenmeer) compared with till and bedrock. These data suggest that mountain permafrost can be present in block fields several hundred metres lower than in bedrock and till, providing other conditions remain the same. Better thermal coupling of the ground and the air in winter was responsible for the observed anomaly, probably caused by enhanced conduction through blocks protruding into and through the snow and thereby acting as efficient heat bridges. Convection in the blocky debris, which has been used previously as an explanation of the negative thermal anomaly, was less important than initially presumed.

  abstract = {High mountains represent one of the most dynamic environments on earth. Monitoring their terrain changes is necessary to understand mass-transport systems, to detect related environmental variability, and to assess natural hazards. Here, we apply standard software to automatically generate digital elevation models (DEM) from aerial photography and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite stereo imagery. By comparison to a photogrammetrically derived DEM, an accuracy of F 60 m RMS of the ASTER DEM was found for rough high-mountain topography, and F 18 m RMS for moderately mountainous terrain. Differences between multi-temporal DEMs are used to determine vertical terrain changes. Horizontal movements are computed from multi-temporal orthoimages. The techniques are applied for three case studies. (1) The flow-field of Tasman glacier, New Zealand, as measured from ASTER data, showed glacier speeds of up to 250 m per year and a surprising minimum speed in the middle of the glacier. (2) The velocity-field of creeping mountain permafrost in Val Muragl, Swiss Alps, with speeds of up to 0.5 m per year was determined with high resolution from aerial stereo imagery and provided new insights in the spatial coherence of permafrost creep. (3) Deformations of up to 0.1 m per year on a large landslide near Aletsch glacier, Swiss Alps, could be detected. As a rule of thumb, we estimate the achieved accuracy for elevation changes and horizontal displacements to approximate the size of one image pixel, i.e. 15 m for ASTER and 0.2 {\textendash} 0.3 m for the here-used aerial photography.},

The study area consists of high elevation glaciers draining through the rough topography of the Bhutan Himalayas. It turns out that the ASTER-derived and SRTM3 DEMs have similar accuracy over the study area, but the SRTM3 DEM contains less gross errors. However, for rough topography large sections of the SRTM3 DEM contain no data. We therefore compile a combined SRTM3-ASTER DEM. From this final composite-master DEM, we produce repeat ASTER orthoimages from which we evaluate the DEM quality and derive glacier surface velocities through image matching. The glacier tongues north of the Himalayan main ridge, which enter the Tibet plateau, show maximum surface velocities in the order of 100{\textendash}200 m year{\`A}1. In contrast, the ice within the glacier tongues south of the main ridge flows with a few tens of meters per year. These findings have a number of implications, among others for glacier dynamics, glacier response to climate change, glacier lake development, or glacial erosion. The study indicates that space-based remote sensing can provide new insights into the magnitude of selected surface processes and feedback mechanisms that govern mountain geodynamics.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The detachment of large parts of low-angle mountain glaciers resulting in massive ice{\textendash}rock avalanches have so far been believed to be a unique type of event, made known to the global scientific community first for the 2002 Kolka Glacier detachment, Caucasus Mountains, and then for the 2016 collapses of two glaciers in the Aru range, Tibet. Since 2016, several so-far unrecognized low-angle glacier detachments have been recognized and described, and new ones have occurred. In the current contribution, we compile, compare, and discuss 20 actual or suspected large-volume detachments of low-angle mountain glaciers at~10 different sites in the Caucasus, the Pamirs, Tibet, Altai, the North American Cordillera, and the Southern Andes. Many of the detachments reached volumes in the order of 10{\textendash}100\,million\,m3. The similarities and differences between the presented cases indicate that glacier detachments often involve a coincidental combination of factors related to the lowering of basal friction, high or increasing driving stresses, concentration of shear stress, or low resistance to exceed stability thresholds. Particularly soft glacier beds seem to be a common condition among the observed events as they offer smooth contact areas between the glacier and the underlying substrate and are prone to till-strength weakening and eventually basal failure under high pore-water pressure. Partially or fully thawed glacier bed conditions and the presence of liquid water could thus play an important role in the detachments. Surface slopes of the detached glaciers range between around 10{$\circ$} and 20{$\circ$}. This may be low enough to enable the development of thick and thus large-volume glaciers while also being steep enough to allow critical driving stresses to build up. We construct a simple slab model to estimate ranges of glacier slope and width above which a glacier may be able to detach when extensively losing basal resistance. From this model we estimate that all the detachments described in this study occurred due to a basal shear stress reduction of more than 50\,\%. Most of the ice{\textendash}rock avalanches resulting from the detachments in this study have a particularly low angle of reach, down to around 5{$\circ$}, likely due to their high ice content and connected liquefaction potential, the availability of soft basal slurries, and large amounts of basal water, as well as the smooth topographic setting typical for glacial valleys. Low-angle glacier detachments combine elements and likely also physical processes of glacier surges and ice break-offs from steep glaciers. The surge-like temporal evolution ahead of several detachments and their geographic proximity to other surge-type glaciers indicate the glacier detachments investigated can be interpreted as endmembers of the continuum of surge-like glacier instabilities. Though rare, glacier detachments appear to be more frequent than commonly thought and disclose, despite local differences in conditions and precursory evolutions, the fundamental and critical potential of low-angle soft glacier beds to fail catastrophically.},

Three previous models have been proposed to explain the tectonic evolution and architecture of the basin, but there is no consensus on development of individual structures. In this study, we use 2D industry seismic reflection data, potential field and well data, as well as previously published information to understand the Early Cretaceous structural evolution of the Troms{\o} Basin in the context of the geodynamic processes in the SWBS. Mapping of the main seismic sequences and faults, time thickness map were integrated with modeled gravity anomalies along a composite 2D regional seismic section to facilitate the interpretation of crustal structures, which then were structurally restored. We propose a revised Early Cretaceous structural model for the Troms{\o} Basin, which involves oblique extension and formation of an intra-basinal transpressional transfer zone. This explains formation of the compressional faulting during overall extension in the SW Barents Sea. Basement heterogeneity most likely played an important role in localizing strain. The 2D sequential restoration of the composite regional seismic section yields an estimate of ca. 35~km of crustal extension in the SW Barents Sea margin, from the earliest Cretaceous until the present. Crustal thickness along the gravity modeled 2D regional section displayed a thinner crust below the Troms{\o} Basin as compared to the S{\o}rvestnaget and Hammerfest basins favoring the interpretation of the Troms{\o} Basin as oblique rifting. This study illustrates the importance of detailed and regionally integrated analysis of rifted basins for reconstructing their evolution, as analysis of oblique rifted basins using two-dimensional plane strain can lead to erroneous assessment of faulting style and deformation.},

  abstract = {Offshore wind energy is regarded as a key component of future energy systems. However, rolling out wind energy on a large scale requires scientific, technological and economic breakthroughs. Wind power forecasting, resource assessment, wind farm optimization, and turbine load assessments all rely on engineering models that simulate the interaction between the wind and the turbine(s). These models often represent the wind in an idealised fashion, which introduces uncertainties that translate into financial risk for investors. This thesis addresses these uncertainties by re-evaluating common assumptions about the (offshore) wind field, studying the physics that governs winds in coastal areas, evaluating the representation of offshore winds in numerical weather prediction models, and proposing alternative methods to represent the offshore wind climate in engineering models. To characterize uncertainties in the simulated wind climate, the concept of anomalous wind events is introduced. An important and illustrative example is the low-level jet. During a low-level jet event, the wind speed does not increase monotonically with height, as is often assumed. Instead, it reaches a maximum in the lower atmosphere (typically around wind turbine hub height), and then decreases with height. As such, low-level jets can substantially impact power production and wind loads on the turbine. This research finds that low-level jets occur often over the North Sea. Moreover, numerical weather prediction models struggle to adequately represent this phenomenon. A climatology based on observations is also biased, because the observations are limited in time and space. This work shows that a reliable climatology combines field observations with output of reanalysis products. Examination of the physics governing low-level jet characteristics reveals the complexity of the wind field in coastal areas, and over the North Sea in particular. The thermal contrast between land and sea plays a pivotal role in the manifestation of the wind field. This feature is not unique for the North Sea, but the relatively small scale and complex coastlines in this area pose an extra challenge in describing the local climatology. It is shown that the newest generation of downscaled reanalysis datasets, represented by the Dutch Offshore Wind Atlas and the New European Wind Atlas represent this complex wind field with reasonable accuracy. As the resolution and quality of weather models and reanalysis products increase, direct coupling between meteorological forcing data and wind energy engineering models becomes an appealing alternative to the use of idealized inflow fields. However, this paradigm shift will come with a substantial increase in computational demands and calls for innovative case selection, or dimensionality reduction. The results presented in this thesis provide a starting point to select relevant parameters, and possible directions are extensively discussed.},

The temperature algorithm is based on statistical downscaling of atmospheric temperatures. The precipitation algorithm incorporates orographic predictors including wind fields, valley exposition, and boundary layer height, with a subsequent bias correction. The resulting data consist of a monthly temperature and precipitation climatology for the years 1979{\textendash}2013. We compare the data derived from the CHELSA algorithm with other standard gridded products and station data from the Global Historical Climate Network. We compare the performance of the new climatologies in species distribution modelling and show that we can increase the accuracy of species range predictions. We further show that CHELSA climatological data has a similar accuracy as other products for temperature, but that its predictions of precipitation patterns are better.},

  abstract = {Arctic warming alters regional hydrological systems, as permafrost thaw increases active layer thickness and in turn alters the pathways of water flow through the landscape. Further, permafrost thaw may change the connectivity between deeper and shallower groundwater and surface water altering the terrestrial water balance and distribution. Thermokarst lakes and wetlands in the Arctic offer a window into such changes as these landscape elements depend on permafrost and are some of the most dynamic and widespread features in Arctic lowland regions. In this study we used Landsat remotely sensed imagery to investigate potential shifts in thermokarst lake size-distributions, which may be brought about by permafrost thaw, over three distinct time periods (1973, 1987{\textendash}1988, and 2007{\textendash}2009) in three hydrological basins in northwestern Siberia. Results revealed fluctuations in total area and number of lakes over time, with both appearing and disappearing lakes alongside stable lakes. On the whole basin scales, there is no indication of any sustained long-term change in thermokarst lake area or lake size abundance over time. This statistical temporal consistency indicates that spatially variable change effects on local permafrost conditions have driven the individual lake changes that have indeed occurred over time. The results highlight the importance of using multi-temporal remote sensing data that can reveal complex spatiotemporal variations distinguishing fluctuations from sustained change trends, for accurate interpretation of thermokarst lake changes and their possible drivers in periods of climate and permafrost change.},

However, assessments of wind energy resource are usually based on today's climate, rather than taking into account that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions continue to modify the global atmospheric circulation. Here, we apply an industry wind turbine power curve to simulations of high and low future emissions scenarios in an ensemble of ten fully coupled global climate models to investigate large-scale changes in wind power across the globe. Our calculations reveal decreases in wind power across the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes and increases across the tropics and Southern Hemisphere, with substantial regional variations. The changes across the northern mid-latitudes are robust responses over time in both emissions scenarios, whereas the Southern Hemisphere changes appear critically sensitive to each individual emissions scenario. In addition, we find that established features of climate change can explain these patterns: polar amplification is implicated in the northern mid-latitude decrease in wind power, and enhanced land{\textendash}sea thermal gradients account for the tropical and southern subtropical increases.},

  abstract = {Despite great progress in simulating multiphysics problems using the numerical discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs), one still cannot seamlessly incorporate noisy data into existing algorithms, mesh generation remains complex, and high-dimensional problems governed by parameterized PDEs cannot be tackled. Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-time domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-dimensional problems.},

Off-the-shelf ML models, however, do not necessarily obey the fundamental governing laws of physical systems, nor do they generalize well to scenarios on which they have not been trained. We survey systematic approaches to incorporating physics and domain knowledge into ML models and distill these approaches into broad categories. Through 10 case studies, we show how these approaches have been used successfully for emulating, downscaling, and forecasting weather and climate processes. The accomplishments of these studies include greater physical consistency, reduced training time, improved data efficiency, and better generalization. Finally, we synthesize the lessons learned and identify scientific, diagnostic, computational, and resource challenges for developing truly robust and reliable physics-informed ML models for weather and climate processes.

Yohai Kaspi and Tapio Schneider now show that oceans are indeed an important underlying cause for the temperature difference, but they identify a surprising mechanism for the phenomenon. Climate modelling suggests that paradoxically, the relative coldness of North America, not the warmth of Europe, arises because of the warm waters of the Gulf Stream. Warm Gulf Stream waters adjacent to the North American coast {\textemdash} and similarly warm ocean waters on Asia's Pacific coast {\textemdash} generate atmospheric waves that draw cold northern air to continental areas westward of the currents.},

We applied five different statistical methods to reconstruct the GMST of the past 12,000 years (Holocene). Each method used different approaches to averaging the globally distributed time series and to characterizing various sources of uncertainty, including proxy temperature, chronology and methodological choices. The results were aggregated to generate a multi-method ensemble of plausible GMST and latitudinal-zone temperature reconstructions with a realistic range of uncertainties. The warmest 200-year-long interval took place around 6500 years ago when GMST was 0.7\,{$^\circ$}C (0.3, 1.8) warmer than the 19               th               Century (median, 5               th               , 95               th               percentiles). Following the Holocene~global thermal maximum, GMST cooled at an average rate -0.08\,{$^\circ$}C per 1000 years (-0.24, -0.05).

The main issues in design of offshore wind turbines in regions of recent development have been aero- and hydro-dynamic loads; however, earthquake is a design concern in seismic areas such as East Asia and Western United states. This paper reviews the state of practice in seismic design of offshore wind turbines. It is demonstrated that wind turbines are in particular vulnerable to vertical earthquake excitation due to their rather high natural frequencies in vertical direction; however, inclusion of the radiation damping could contribute considerably reduce the earthquake loads. Moreover, it is demonstrated how soil nonlinearity could lead to settlement and permanent tilting of offshore wind turbines on caisson foundations or tripods. Using these cases, the paper demonstrates that the design of offshore wind turbines for earthquake loading is driven by performance-based considerations.},

Its emergence has been linked to a slowdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, which leads to a reduced ocean heat transport into the warming hole region. Here we show that, in addition to the reduced low-latitude heat import, increased ocean heat transport out of the region into higher latitudes and a shortwave cloud feedback dominate the formation and temporal evolution of the warming hole under greenhouse gas forcing. In climate model simulations of the historical period, the low-latitude Atlantic meridional overturning circulation decline does not emerge from natural variability, whereas the accelerating heat transport to higher latitudes is clearly attributable to anthropogenic forcing. Both the overturning and the gyre circulation contribute to the increased high-latitude ocean heat transport, and therefore are critical to understand the past and future evolutions of the warming hole.},

The ability to retrieve accurate SST from satellites is dependent on many factors including spectral response, radiometer noise, pre-launch instrument characterization and in flight behavior, calibration, viewing geometry, cloud screening and correction of the clear-sky atmospheric effects. We present a characterization of both the historical and current MODIS SST products, and we describe the evolution of, and motivation for, improvements in MODIS SST for each Collection released to the public, i.e., each radiance level mission data reprocessing, each driven by improved knowledge of the instrument behavior and better corrections for instrumental artifacts.},

Various mathematical approaches have been used to correct the lateral and lower boundary conditions of regional climate models (RCMs). Most of these techniques correct only the magnitude of each variable individually over time without regard to spatial and multivariate bias. Here, we investigate how well an RCM is able to reproduce the dependence of an observed variable based on three aspects: temporal, spatial, and multivariate. Results show that the RCM simulations with univariate bias-corrected GCM boundary conditions perform well in capturing both temporal and spatial dependence. However, all RCM simulations do not show improvement in the representation of dependence between variables, indicating the need for alternatives that correct systematic biases in multivariate dependence in both lateral and lower boundary conditions.},

The proposed model is validated through a cross-validatory (CV) evaluation using rainfall data from a set of weather stations in South Korea and climate change scenarios simulated by three alternate RCMs. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model to simulate the bias-corrected daily rainfall sequences over large regions at fine resolutions.

  abstract = {The Snow Ensemble Uncertainty Project (SEUP) is an effort to establish a baseline characterization of snow water equivalent (SWE) uncertainty across North America with the goal of informing global snow observational needs. An ensemble-based modeling approach, encompassing a suite of current operational models is used to assess the uncertainty in SWE and total snow storage (SWS) estimation over North America during the 2009{\textendash}2017 period. The highest modeled SWE uncertainty is observed in mountainous regions, likely due to the relatively deep snow, forcing uncertainties, and variability between the different models in resolving the snow processes over complex terrain. This highlights a need for high-resolution observations in mountains to capture the high spatial SWE variability. The greatest SWS is found in Tundra regions where, even though the spatiotemporal variability in modeled SWE is low, there is considerable uncertainty in the SWS estimates due to the large areal extent over which those estimates are spread. This highlights the need for high accuracy in snow estimations across the Tundra. In midlatitude boreal forests, large uncertainties in both SWE and SWS indicate that vegetation{\textendash}snow impacts are a critical area where focused improvements to modeled snow estimation efforts need to be made. Finally, the SEUP results indicate that SWE uncertainty is driving runoff uncertainty, and measurements may be beneficial in reducing uncertainty in SWE and runoff, during the melt season at high latitudes (e.g., Tundra and Taiga regions) and in the western mountain regions, whereas observations at (or near) peak SWE accumulation are more helpful over the midlatitudes.},

Studies of historical events were identified in most countries, and good examples of national databases attempting to collate the available information were identified.

Simulated regional climate data is necessary because of the absence of station data in that region. To perform large-scale assessments we use the satellite-derived daily SWE product of ESA DUE GlobSnow from 1987 to 2010. Russian station SWE data is used for cross-checking the findings. In January (mid-winter), the SWE hindcast is in good agreement with GlobSnow, whereas it overestimates SWE during the melting season. CCLM shows a clear added value in providing realistic SWE information compared to the driving reanalysis. The temporal consistency of CCLM is higher than that presented by ERA-Interim and NCEP-R2.},

One of the most successful techniques for accomplishing this is called Model Output Statistics (MOS). The MOS method involves matching observations of local weather with output from numerical models. Forecast equations are then derived by statistical techniques such as screening regression, regression estimation of event probabilities, and the logit model. In this way the bias and inaccuracy of the numerical model, as well as the local climatology, can be built into the forecast system. MOS has been applied by the Techniques Development Laboratory to produce automated forecasts of numerous weather elements including precipitation, temperature, wind, clouds, ceiling, visibility, and thunderstorms.

These aims were achieved by assessing the sensitivity to record length of the predictive performance of several probability distributions. A bootstrapping approach was used by resampling (with replacement) record lengths of 30 to 90 years (50 resamples for each record length) from the original record and fitting distributions to these subsamples. Subsequently, the fits were evaluated according to several goodness-of-fit measures and to the variability of the predicted flood quantiles. Our initial hypothesis that shorter records favor two-parameter distributions was not clearly supported. The ordinary moments method was the most stable while providing equivalent goodness-of-fit.},

  abstract = {One major concern of climate modeling is the projection of future extreme events as they have the most severe impact on society and environment. This is a challenging task for modeling and due to the low occurrence rate of extreme values. Furthermore, the local-scale characteristics of extreme events demand for high resolution model data. In the framework of the EURO-CORDEX initiative, climate model ensemble data on 0.11{$^\circ$} grid resolution are produced. In order to provide climate data on a higher resolution in an efficient and reliable way, a statistical downscaling method has been developed, which combines bias adjustment and downscaling. With this method, an ensemble of climate model data on a target resolution of 5 km has been built and it was established as a reference ensemble for Germany. The ensemble consists of the three scenarios RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5, 44 members in total. The method is comprehensible and of minimum complexity. It involves objective predictor selection and it can be applied for different areas, horizontal resolutions, target variables and predictor data sets, and, thus, providing high flexibility. While the methodology imposes refined structures onto modeled data, it does not affect the models data range and therefore allows for extrapolation beyond observed values. The raw model data show for threshold-based indices a rather large spread and bias, which was tremendously improved in the bias adjustment step. Downscaling is challenging as local terrain features can introduce unpredictable residual variation without localized information from e.g. observations. In particular, temperature-based extreme values were well captured by the downscaling algorithm, as temperature is strongly elevation dependent.},

In this study, a comprehensive evaluation of the vertical accuracy of globally available DEMs from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) World 3D and TanDEM-X WorldDEM‚Ñ¢ was conducted for a large region in Northern Chile. Additionally, several very high-resolution DEM datasets were derived from Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) 6/7 and Pl{\'e}iades stereo satellite imagery for smaller areas. All datasets were evaluated with three reference datasets, namely elevation points from both Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation (ICESat) satellites, as well as very accurate high-resolution elevation data derived by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based photogrammetry and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). The accuracy was also evaluated with regard to the existing relief by relating the accuracy results to slope, terrain ruggedness index (TRI) and topographic position index (TPI). For all datasets with global availability, the highest overall accuracies are reached by TanDEM-X WorldDEM‚Ñ¢ and the lowest by ASTER Global DEM (GDEM). On the local scale, Pl{\'e}iades DEMs showed a slightly higher accuracy as SPOT imagery. Generally, accuracy highly depends on topography and the error is rising up to four times for high resolution DEMs and up to eight times for low-resolution DEMs in steeply sloped terrain compared to flat landscapes.},

Areas with dense tree cover show a mean error of 6{\textendash}10 m. The highest accuracies were achieved by the SRTM DEM, followed by other DEMs that mainly implemented SRTM data.

  abstract = {Spatially distributed meteorological information at the slope scale is relevant for many processes in complex terrain, yet information at this sub-km spatial resolution is difficult to obtain. While downscaling to kilometer resolutions is well described in literature, moving beyond the kilometer scale is not. In this work, we present a methodical comparison of three downscaling methods of varying complexity, that are used to downscale data from the Numerical Weather Prediction model COSMO-1 at 1.1~km horizontal resolution to 250 and 50~m over a domain of highly complex terrain in the Swiss Alps. We compare WRF, a dynamical atmospheric model; ICAR, a model of intermediate complexity; and TopoSCALE, an efficient topography-based downscaling scheme. Point-scale comparisons show similar results amongst all three models w.r.t. mean-error statistics, but underlying dynamics are different. Ridge-flow interactions show reasonable agreement between WRF and ICAR at 250~m model resolution. However, at 50~m resolution WRF is able to simulate complex flow patterns that ICAR cannot. Validation against Lidar data suggests that only WRF is able to capture preferential deposition of snow. Based on these findings and the significant reduction in computational costs, ICAR is a cost efficient alternative to WRF at the 250~m resolution. TopoScale performs very well in point-scale comparisons, but it is unclear if this can be attributed to the model itself or to the forcing data and the observations assimilated therein. Further study is required to quantify this effect.},

Tests examine the influence of water temperature, wind and current velocities, iceberg size, and wave height. The results indicate that wave height plays a major role in iceberg deterioration. Wind velocity and water temperature also play significant roles. In contrast, water current had little influence on iceberg deterioration.

Navigation is one of the areas where the influence of floating ice is particularly evident. The history of ice threats to navigation and hardships experienced by early mariners are well known. At present, even with all the new technologies, ice can pose serious challenges. A major threat arises when the ice around a ship starts to converge. The compression or ice pressure builds up if wind and water currents drive the ice cover against a land boundary. The ice cover compresses and the ice accumulates to form ridges. If a ship is caught in such a situation, the pressures on the hull will be high. Additionally, the ridges can introduce serious impediments to ship progress. Consequently, ice resistance would dramatically increase, and the ship can become beset. In extreme cases, ships can be damaged, and smaller vessels can be completely lifted onto the ice.},

However, the sensitivity of HK glaciers to changes in meteorological forcing remains largely unknown. We analyzed modelled interannual variability of mass balance (MB) that is validated against available observations, to quantify the sensitivity of MB to meteorological factors over the HK. Within the model, snowfall variability (0.06\,m/yr) explains {\textasciitilde}60\% of the MB variability (0.28\,m/yr), implying a sensitivity of MB on snowfall to the tune of several hundreds of percent. This stunningly high sensitivity of MB to snowfall offers crucial insights into the mechanism of the recent divergent glacier response over the HK. Our findings underscore the need for sustained measurements and model representations of the spatiotemporal variability of snowfall, one of the least-studied factors over the glacierized HK, for capturing the large-scale and yet region-specific glacier changes taking place over the HK.},

  abstract = {Simultaneous marine acquisition is an economic way to sample seismic data and speedup acquisition, wherein single and/or multiple source vessels fire sources at near-simultaneous or slightly random times, resulting in overlapping shot records. The current paradigm for simultaneous towed-streamer marine acquisition incorporates "low-variability" in source firing times{\textendash}-i.e., {\l}eq 1 or 2 seconds, since both the sources and receivers are moving. This results in low degree of randomness in simultaneous data, which is challenging to separate (into its constituent sources) using compressed sensing based separation techniques since randomization is the key to successful recovery via compressed sensing. In this paper, we address the challenge of source separation for simultaneous towed-streamer acquisitions via two compressed sensing based approaches{\textendash}-i.e., sparsity-promotion and rank-minimization. We illustrate the performance of both the sparsity-promotion and rank-minimization based techniques by simulating two simultaneous towed-streamer acquisition scenarios{\textendash}-i.e., over/under and simultaneous long offset. We observe that the proposed approaches give good and comparable recovery qualities of the separated sources, but the rank-minimization technique is relatively faster and memory efficient. We also compare these two techniques with the NMO-based median filtering type approach.}

Novel climate reanalysis products outperform legacy data products in accuracy, temporal resolution, and provision of uncertainty metrics. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop a workflow through which to integrate these improved data into biological analyses. The ERA5 product family (ERA5 and ERA5-Land) are the latest and most advanced global reanalysis products created by the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasting. These data products offer up to 83 essential climate variables at hourly intervals for the time-period of 1981 to today with preliminary back-extensions being available for 1950{\textendash}1981. Spatial resolutions range from 30 {\texttimes} 30 km (ERA5) to 11 {\texttimes} 11 km (ERA5-Land) and can be statistically downscaled to study-requirements at finer spatial resolutions. Kriging is one such method to interpolate data to finer resolutions and has the advantages that one can leverage additional covariate information and obtain the uncertainty associated with the downscaling. The KrigR R-package enables users to (a) download ERA5(-Land) climate reanalysis data for a user-specified region, and time-period, (b) aggregate these climate products to desired temporal resolutions and metrics, (c) acquire topographical co-variates, and (d) statistically downscale spatial data to a user-specified resolution using co-variate data via kriging. KrigR can execute all these tasks in a single function call, thus enabling the user to obtain any of 83 (ERA5)/50 (ERA5-Land) climate variables at high spatial and temporal resolution with a single R-command. Additionally, KrigR contains functionality for computation of bioclimatic variables and aggregate metrics from the variables offered by ERA5(-Land). This R-package provides an easy-to-implement workflow for implementation of state-of-the-art climate data while avoiding issues of storage limitations at high temporal and spatial resolutions by providing data according to user-needs rather than in global data sets. Consequently, KrigR provides a toolbox to obtain a wide range of tailored climate data at unprecedented combinations of high temporal and spatial resolutions thus enabling the use of world-leading climate data through the R-interface and beyond.},

The methodologies, considerations, and assumptions used in the conversion of freeboard to ice thickness are discussed. The thickness distributions of the Arctic multiyear and seasonal ice covers are contrasted. Broadly, the resulting fields seem seasonally and interannually consistent in terms of thickness, growth and ice production. We find mean thicknesses of 2.15/2.46 m in ON05/FM06 and an overall thinner ice cover of 1.96/2.37 m in ON06/MA07. This represents a growth of {$\sim$}0.3 m and {$\sim$}0.4 m during the {$\sim$}4-month intervals of the ON05-FM06 and ON06-MA07 campaigns, respectively. After accounting for data gaps, we compute overall Arctic Ocean ice volumes of 11,318, 14,075, 10,626, and 13,891 km3 for the ON05, FM06, ON06, and MA07 campaigns, respectively. The higher total volume in ON05 (versus ON06) can be attributed to the higher multiyear ice coverage that fall: 37\% versus 31\%. However, the higher estimated ice production (less export) during the second year (3265 versus 2757 km3) is likely due to the higher growth rate over the larger expanse of seasonal sea ice during the fall and winter. Inside a 25-km radius of two mooring locations in the Beaufort Sea, the estimated mean ICESat ice drafts from ON05 and FM06 are within 0.5 m of those measured at the moorings.},

Our results can provide guidance to impact modelers and decision-makers regarding the uncertainties associated with downscaling and bias-correction when performing local-scale analyses, as neglecting to account for these uncertainties may risk overconfidence relative to the full range of possible climate futures.},

Employing the coupled-model constraint in the analysis implies that assimilation of an ocean observation has immediate impact on the atmospheric state estimate and, conversely, assimilation of an atmospheric observation affects the ocean state. This covariance between atmosphere and ocean induced by the analysis method is illustrated with simple numerical experiments. Realistic data assimilation experiments based on the global observing system are then used to assess the quality of the assimilation method. Comparison with an uncoupled system shows a mostly neutral impact overall, with slightly improved temperature estimates in the upper ocean and lower atmosphere.

  abstract = {The dynamics and paleo-glaciology of ice sheet interiors during the last deglaciation are poorly constrained, hindering ice sheet model reconstructions. We provide direct evidence of Fennoscandian Ice Sheet (FIS) interior behavior during deglaciation through surface exposure dating. Our results demonstrate early thinning of the FIS, prior to the Younger Dryas (YD, 12.8{\textendash}11.7 ka). Interior thinning in central Norway was concurrent with retreat along the coastline, exposing ice-free mountainous tracts, potentially as early as 20{\textendash}15 ka. The FIS then formed moraines in these ice-free tracts during the YD. This is contrary to current hypotheses advocating a landscape fully covered by cold, inactive ice during this period. Present empirical and model reconstructions fail to capture rapid interior downwastage, increasing uncertainties in ice sheet volume estimates and sea level contributions. Plain Language Summary The decay of past ice sheets provides an analogue for the retreat of present-day ice sheets, due to rapidly changing climate conditions experienced then and now. One limitation with ice reconstructions is, however, that they rarely contain dated evidence for how the ice sheet interiors behaved during their termination. In a new reconstruction of the geometry of the southern part of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet (FIS), we overcome this limitation. We document that areas at the heart of the southern ice dome, previously thought to be consumed by thick ice, were in fact ice-free 12,000 years ago suggesting that the FIS was considerably thinner than thought and that previous estimates of the ice sheet's volume need to be recalculated.},

With the introduction of new and better low noise streamers, in addition to the ability to record and deblend simultaneous source data, it is time to revisit the use of triple-sources in marine seismic exploration for decreased crossline bin-size leading to better spatial resolution. The data from the triple-source configuration flip-flop-flap sequential firing mode, is similar in quality compared to flip-flop conventional dual-source acquisition mode. When firing off the triple-sources in simultaneous mode, giving reduced shot-point interval, the results appear to be better than for dual-source flip-flop mode mainly due to increased fold and less aliasing of pre-stack gathers. A triple-source configuration can find its application in shallow and deeper water areas for imaging of targets where reduced crossline spacing and higher fold may be required.},

For example, slope breaks and knickpoints in rivers can be important in understanding tectonic processes, and riffle-pool structures are important drivers of riverine ecology. More precise data (e.g., lidar) are available in some areas, but their spatial extent limits large-scale research. The upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission is planned to launch in 2021 and will provide measurements of elevation and inundation extent of surface waters between 78{$^\circ$} north and south latitude on average twice every 21 days. We present a novel noise reduction method for multitemporal river water surface elevation (WSE) profiles from SWOT that combines a truncated singular value decomposition and a slope-constrained least-squares estimator. We use simulated SWOT data of 85{\textendash}145 km sections of the Po, Sacramento, and Tanana Rivers to show that 3{\textendash}12 months of simulated SWOT data can produce elevation profiles with mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 5.38{\textendash}12.55 cm at 100{\textendash}200 m along-stream resolution. MAEs can be reduced further to 4{\textendash}11 cm by averaging all observations. The average profiles have errors much lower than existing DEMs, allowing new advances in riverine research globally. We consider two case studies in geomorphology and ecology that highlight the scientific value of the more accurate in-river DEMs expected from SWOT. Simulated SWOT elevation profiles for the Po reveal convexities in the river longitudinal profile that are spatially coincident with the upward projection of blind thrust faults that are buried beneath the Po Plain at the northern termination of the Apennine Mountains. Meanwhile, simulated SWOT data for the Sacramento River reveals locally steep sections of the river profile that represent important habitat for benthic invertebrates at a spatial scale previously unrecognizable in large-scale DEMs presently available for this river.},

This was BP's first trial using fullwaveform inversion for imaging ``EWATS'' (full-azimuth ultralong-offset) streamer data, which posed a unique challenge due to the combination of difficult geology and slightly inferior low-frequency and long-offset content compared with OBN data. Specifically, a large sediment suture between two saltbodies in our study area proved problematic for imaging. We carried out various scenario tests including: 1) the use of a ``legacy FWI'' algorithm combined with manual salt interpretation to update our legacy velocity model, and 2) using a new FWI algorithm without manual interpretation to update multiple starting models. Results demonstrate imaging improvements that impacted a recent exploration and appraisal drilling campaign. The improved image and velocity model resulting from FWI helped to resolve a shallow carapace section and intrasalt sediment inclusions which influenced operational decisions during real-time drilling. Additionally, the subsalt structural image was enhanced which improved resource estimations and will likely impact future appraisal and development well locations.},

  abstract = {The snow cover is a key component of land surface hydrology, especially in mountain areas where it governs the amount and timing of water availability in downstream areas. It is involved in relevant climate feedbacks and natural hazards such as avalanches and floods. Monitoring and forecasting snow cover characteristics is challenging. While snow cover extent is relatively easy to retrieve from satellite data, remote sensing retrievals of the snow water equivalent (SWE) is often inaccurate, particularly in complex mountainous terrain. Model-based snow cover estimates, driven by meteorological data, often bear significant uncertainties due to both input data and model errors. Data assimilation can combine both approaches to improve SWE estimates. In this paper, we review current state-of-the-art data assimilation methodologies used to optimally combine measurements with snow cover models in order to reduce uncertainties. The suitability of a given data assimilation method varies with the numerical complexity of snow models as well as the availability and the type of observations. This review describes the issues and challenges associated with data assimilation applied to the mountain snow cover, providing recommendations for existing and upcoming monitoring and prediction systems of snow hydrology in mountainous regions.},

Observations show that areas and periods affected by the heatwave correspond to strong positive anomalies of surface incoming longwave fluxes ({$\mkern1mu$}LWin{$\mkern1mu$}) and negative anomalies of incoming shortwave fluxes ({$\mkern1mu$}SWin{$\mkern1mu$}). The latter are explained by clouds in the Sahara, and by both clouds and dust loadings in the Sahel. However, the strong positive anomalies of LWin are hardly related to cloud or aerosol radiative effects. An analysis based on climate-model simulations (CNRMAM) complemented by a specially-designed conceptual soil-atmospheric surface layer model (SARAWI) shows that this positive anomaly of LWin is mainly due to a water vapor greenhouse effect. SARAWI, which represents the two processes driving temperatures, namely turbulence and longwave radiative transfer between the soil and the atmospheric surface layer, points to the crucial impact of synoptic low-level advection of water vapor on Tmin{$\mkern1mu$}. By increasing the atmospheric infrared emissivity, the advected water vapor dramatically increases the nocturnal radiative warming of the soil surface, then in turn reducing the nocturnal cooling of the atmospheric surface layer, which remains warm throughout the night. Over Western Sahel, this advection is related to an early northward incursion of the monsoon flow. Over Sahara, the anomalously high precipitable water is due to a tropical plume event. Both observations and simulations support this major influence of the low-level water vapor radiative effect on Tmin during this spring heatwave.},

  abstract = {Snow avalanches are a significant natural hazard in Norway. One method to manage the backcountry avalanche hazard is through detailed mapping of avalanche terrain. Avalanche terrain can be mapped using a variety of methods, including using the Avalanche Terrain Exposure Scale (ATES); however, manual classification of terrain using ATES is time consuming. This study has developed and compared a fully automated algorithm to provide ATES mapping for all of Norway. Our new algorithm is based on the technical model for ATES mapping. This model has specific terrain-based thresholds that can be applied for automated terrain-based modeling. Our algorithm expands on prior work by including the potential release area (PRA) model to identify and calculate the likelihood of an avalanche releasing from a start zone. We also use the raster-based TauDEM-model to determine the avalanche runout length. The final product is a 10-m resolution ATES map. We compared this nationwide ATES map with areas that have been manually mapped by avalanche experts, and find that the automated approach yields similar and reliable results. In addition to comparing mapped areas, we also examine manually mapped linear routes and compare these with the automated mapped ATES areas. Our results suggest that for open terrain, the vast majority of the manually classified tracks are predominantly in the same ATES class as our algorithm. For forested areas, we get mixed results, which can be attributed to a lack of suitable vegetation data at an appropriate scale. Despite this limitation, the current ATES algorithm and resulting spatial data are already valuable as a large portion ({\textasciitilde}\,70\%) of the Norwegian backcountry terrain is above tree line. The automated algorithm is also useful to ensure consistent manual classification across different regions in Norway, or globally, and will permit greater reproducibility and easier updating of mapping for the future.},

The Global Wind Energy Council has raised its outlook for 2030 to a total of 316 GW installed for offshore wind (Lee and Zhao, 2022).

The increase in size raises a series of challenges to the fundamental science and technologies that have been calibrated and applied to smaller turbines, small wind farms, and simpler systems. Thus, for the modeling of wind turbine and farm wake effects, we are facing the challenge of having both high fidelity and large coverage. For modeling turbulence, we need to break through the classical boundary layer turbulence theories by considering large-scale atmospheric variability. For grid integration and system control, we need to advance our tools to handle big data. For floating turbines and farms, we need to take the complicated sea and ocean conditions into account, as well as the multiscale atmospheric flow effects. Additionally, we need to understand how the new seascape in the presence of wind farms affects the overall offshore environment. The rapid success of the offshore wind industry leaves us little time to identify knowledge gaps, speed up relevant research, and catch up technologically to accommodate efficient, effective, and healthy offshore wind development.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Simulation methods for extreme flood estimation represent an important complement to statistical flood frequency analysis because a spectrum of catchment conditions potentially leading to extreme flows can be assessed. In this paper, stochastic, semi-continuous simulation is used to estimate extreme floods in three catchments located in Norway, all of which are characterised by flood regimes in which snowmelt often has a significant role. The simulations are based on SCHADEX, which couples a precipitation probabilistic model with a hydrological simulation such that an exhaustive set of catchment conditions and responses is simulated. The precipitation probabilistic model is conditioned by regional weather patterns, and a bottom{\textendash}up classification procedure was used to define a set of weather patterns producing extreme precipitation in Norway. SCHADEX estimates for the 1000-year (Q1000) discharge are compared with those of several standard methods, including event-based and long-term simulations which use a single extreme precipitation sequence as input to a hydrological model, statistical flood frequency analysis based on the annual maximum series, and the GRADEX method. The comparison suggests that the combination of a precipitation probabilistic model with a long-term simulation of catchment conditions, including snowmelt, produces estimates for given return periods which are more in line with those based on statistical flood frequency analysis, as compared with the standard simulation methods, in two of the catchments. In the third case, the SCHADEX method gives higher estimates than statistical flood frequency analysis and further suggests that the seasonality of the most likely Q1000 events differs from that of the annual maximum flows. The semi-continuous stochastic simulation method highlights the importance of considering the joint probability of extreme precipitation, snowmelt rates and catchment saturation states when assigning return periods to floods estimated by precipitation-runoff methods. The SCHADEX methodology, as applied here, is dependent on observed discharge data for calibration of a hydrological model, and further study to extend its application to ungauged catchments would significantly enhance its versatility.},

For OBN (ocean bottom node) acquisition, cost saving can be achieve from more effective node deployment. The imaging process makes use of the multiple sea-surface reflections to significantly increase the fold, hence compensating for the reduced number of sensors. We will show that with the above imaging technology it is possible to use sparser seabed recording geometry without compromising the 3D or 4D image quality. Using the Jubarte PRM dataset acquired by Petrobras, the decimation test consists of taking out receiver included into circular patches within a diameter of 600 m. The number of sensors is then reduced by a factor two. The results demonstrate that it is possible to break some established limit in term of seabed sensor sparseness without compromising the resolution of 3D/4D imaging.},

Daily meteorological data such as temperature or precipitation from climate models is needed for many climate impact studies, e.g. in hydrology or agriculture but direct model output can contain large systematic errors. Thus, statistical bias adjustment is applied to correct climate model outputs. Here we review existing statistical bias adjustment methods and their shortcomings, and present a method which we call EQA (Empirical Quantile Adjustment), a development of the methods EDCDFm and PresRAT. We then test it in comparison to two existing methods using real and artificially created daily temperature and precipitation data for Austria. We compare the performance of the three methods in terms of the following demands: (1): The model data should match the climatological means of the observational data in the historical period. (2): The long-term climatological trends of means (climate change signal), either defined as difference or as ratio, should not be altered during bias adjustment, and (3): Even models with too few wet days (precipitation above 0.1 mm) should be corrected accurately, so that the wet day frequency is conserved. EQA fulfills (1) almost exactly and (2) at least for temperature.

  abstract = {Daily meteorological data such as temperature or precipitation from climate models are needed for many climate impact studies, e.g., in hydrology or agriculture, but direct model output can contain large systematic errors. A large variety of methods exist to adjust the bias of climate model outputs. Here we review existing statistical bias-adjustment methods and their shortcomings, and compare quantile mapping (QM), scaled distribution mapping (SDM), quantile delta mapping (QDM) and an empiric version of PresRAT (PresRATe). We then test these methods using real and artificially created daily temperature and precipitation data for Austria. We compare the performance in terms of the following demands: (1) the model data should match the climatological means of the observational data in the historical period; (2) the long-term climatological trends of means (climate change signal), either defined as difference or as ratio, should not be altered during bias adjustment; and (3) even models with too few wet days (precipitation above 0.1 mm) should be corrected accurately, so that the wet day frequency is conserved. QDM and PresRATe combined fulfill all three demands. For (2) for precipitation, PresRATe already includes an additional correction that assures that the climate change signal is conserved.},

  abstract = {Current models of snow cover distribution, soil moisture, surface runoff and river discharge typically have very simple parameterizations of surface processes, such as degree-day factors or single-layer snow cover representation. For the purpose of reproducing catchment runoff, simple snowmelt routines have proven to be accurate, provided that they are carefully calibrated specifically for the catchment they are applied to. The use of more detailed models is, however, useful to understand and quantify the role of individual surface processes for catchment hydrology, snow cover status and soil moisture distribution. We introduce ALPINE3D, a model for the high-resolution simulation of alpine surface processes, in particular snow processes. The model can be driven by measurements from automatic weather stations or by meteorological model outputs. As a preprocessing alternative, specific high-resolution meteorological fields can be created by running a meteorological model. The core three-dimensional ALPINE3D modules consist of a radiation balance model (which uses a view-factor approach and includes shortwave scattering and longwave emission from terrain and tall vegetation) and a drifting snow model solving a diffusion equation for suspended snow and a saltation transport equation. The processes in the atmosphere are thus treated in three dimensions and are coupled to a distributed (in the hydrological sense of having a spatial representation of the catchment properties) one-dimensional model of vegetation, snow and soil (SNOWPACK) using the assumption that lateral exchange is small in these media. The model is completed by a conceptual runoff module. The model can be run with a choice of modules, thus generating more or less detailed surface forcing data as input for runoff generation simulations. The model modules can be run in a parallel (distributed) mode using a GRID infrastructure to allow computationally demanding tasks. In a case study from the Dischma Valley in eastern Switzerland, we demonstrate that the model is able to simulate snow distribution as seen from a NOAA advanced very high-resolution radiometer image. We then analyse the sensitivity of simulated snow cover distribution and catchment runoff to the use of different surface process descriptions. We compare model runoff simulations with runoff data from 10 consecutive years. The quantitative analysis shows that terrain influence on the radiation processes has a significant influence on catchment hydrology dynamics. Neglecting the role of vegetation and the spatial variability of the soil, on the other hand, had a much smaller influence on the runoff generation dynamics. We conclude that ALPINE3D is a valuable tool to investigate surface dynamics in mountains. It is currently used to investigate snow cover dynamics for avalanche warning and permafrost development and vegetation changes under climate change scenarios. It could also serve to test the output of simpler soil{\textendash}vegetation{\textendash}atmosphere transfer schemes used in larger scale climate or meteorological models and to create accurate soil moisture assessments for meteorological and flood forecasting.

We propose the grouping of meltwater channels and meltwater tracks under the term meltwater corridor and suggest that these features in the order of 10s{\textendash}100s\&thinsp;m wide, commonly surrounding eskers and transitioning along flow between different types, represent the interaction between a central conduit (the esker) and surrounding hydraulically connected distributed drainage system (the meltwater corridor). Our proposed model is based on contemporary observations and modelling which suggest that connections between conduits and the surrounding distributed drainage system within the ablation zone occur as a result of overpressurisation of the conduit. The widespread aerial coverage of meltwater corridors (5\&thinsp;\%{\textendash}36\&thinsp;\% of the bed) provides constraints on the extent of basal uncoupling induced by basal water pressure fluctuations. Geomorphic work resulting from repeated connection to the surrounding hydraulically connected distributed drainage system suggests that basal sediment can be widely accessed and evacuated by meltwater.},

  abstract = {High-resolution spatiotemporal wind speed mapping is useful for atmospheric environmental monitoring, air quality evaluation and wind power siting. Although modern reanalysis techniques can obtain reliable interpolated surfaces of meteorology at a high temporal resolution, their spatial resolutions are coarse. Local variability of wind speed is difficult to capture due to its volatility. Here, a two-stage approach was developed for robust spatiotemporal estimations of wind speed at a high resolution. The proposed approach consists of geographically weighted ensemble machine learning (Stage 1) and downscaling based on meteorological reanalysis data (Stage 2). The geographically weighted machine learning method is based on three base learners, which are an autoencoder-based deep residual network, XGBoost and random forest, and it incorporates spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity to boost the ensemble predictions. With reanalysis data, downscaling was introduced in Stage 2 to reduce bias and spatial abrupt (non-natural) variation in the predictions inferred from Stage 1. The autoencoder-based residual network was used in Stage 2 to adjust the difference between the averages of the fine-resolution predicted values and the coarse-resolution reanalysis data to ensure consistency. Using mainland China as a case study, the geographically weighted regression (GWR) ensemble predictions were shown to perform better than individual learners' predictions (with an approximately 12{\textendash}16\% improvement in R2 and a decrease of 0.14{\textendash}0.19 m/s in root mean square error). Downscaling further improved the predictions by reducing inconsistency and obtaining better spatial variation (smoothing). The proposed approach can also be applied for the high-resolution spatiotemporal estimation of other meteorological parameters or surface variables involving remote sensing images (i.e. reliable coarsely resolved data), ground monitoring data and other relevant factors.},

  abstract = {A distributed modeling of hydrological impact under climate change relies on climate scenarios for multiple climate variables at multiple locations across the catchment. The site-specific or variable-specific downscaling methods only produce climate change scenarios for a specific site or specific variable, which is inadequate to drive distributed hydrological models to investigate the spatio-temporal variability of climate change impacts at the catchment scale. This study proposes an integrated framework combining quantile mapping (QM), stochastic weather generator (WG) and Empirical Copula~(EC) approaches for multi-site multivariate downscaling of global climate model outputs from monthly, grid-scale to daily, station-specific scale. In this hybrid scheme, the QM method is used to spatially downscale the monthly large-scale climate model outputs; then a stochastic WG is used to temporally downscale the monthly data to daily data by adjusting the WG parameters according to the predicted changes from large-scale climate models; at last, the observed inter-site and inter-variable dependencies, the temporal persistence, as well as the inter-annual variability are restored using the EC~approach. An application of the proposed methodology is presented for statistical downscaling of the monthly precipitation, maximum and minimum temperatures from historical simulations of two Earth System Models (ESMs) to eleven weather stations over Daqing river basin in north China. The proposed methodologies are~calibrated during the period 1957{\textendash}1986 and evaluated in the period 1987{\textendash}2016. The results show that the proposed downscaling approach is able to reconstruct the marginally distributional statistics, inter-site and inter-variable dependencies, and temporal persistence in the downscaled data for the validation period. A~Limitation is also noted, such as a possible misrepresentation of the dependence structure and inter-annual variability under a non-stationary climate condition. The proposed methodologies are useful for downscaling ensembles of large-scale climate model simulations and projections for distributed hydrological impact studies.},

  abstract = {A new quantile-based mapping method is developed for the bias correction of monthly global circulation model outputs. Compared to the widely used quantile-based matching method that assumes stationarity and only uses the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the model and observations for the baseline period, the proposed method incorporates and adjusts the model CDF for the projection period on the basis of the difference between the model and observation CDFs for the training (baseline) period. Thus, the method explicitly accounts for distribution changes for a given model between the projection and baseline periods. We demonstrate the use of the new method over northern Eurasia. We fit a four-parameter beta distribution to monthly temperature fields and discuss the sensitivity of the results to the choice of distribution range parameters. For monthly precipitation data, a mixed gamma distribution is used that accounts for the intermittent nature of rainfall. To test the fidelity of the proposed method, we choose 1970{\textendash}1999 as the baseline training period and then randomly select 30 years from 1901{\textendash}1999 as the projection test period. The bootstrapping is repeated 30 times to mimic different climate conditions that may occur, and the results suggest that both methods are comparable when applied to the 20th century for both temperature and precipitation for the examined quartiles. We also discuss the dependence of the bias correction results on the choice of time period for training. This indicates that the remaining biases in the bias-corrected time series are directly tied to the model's performance during the training period, and therefore care should be taken when using a particular training time period. When applied to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change fourth assessment report (AR4) A2 climate scenario projection, the data time series after bias correction from both methods exhibit similar spatial patterns. However, over regions where the climate model shows large changes in projected variability, there are discernable differences between the methods. The proposed method is more sensitive to a reduction in variability, exemplified by wintertime temperature. Further synthetic experiments using the lower 33\% and upper 33\% of the full data set as the validation data suggest that the proposed equidistance quantile-matching method is more efficient in reducing biases than the traditional CDF mapping method for changing climates, especially for the tails of the distribution. This has important consequences for the occurrence and intensity of future projected extreme events such as heat waves, floods, and droughts. As the new method is simple to implement and does not require substantial computational time, it can be used to produce auxiliary ensemble scenarios for various climate impact-oriented applications.},

Subwatersheds are stable physical features, making their centroids more reliable and accurate as control points (CPs) than the other features. In the present method, subwatersheds are delineated from DEMs using hydrological analysis procedures. Modified invariant moments are employed to measure the similarity of subwatersheds for determining the correspondences between the reference and input. Centroids of matched subwatersheds are then derived as CP candidates, where the root-mean-square error is applied to eliminate mismatches using a global consistency check method. The established CP pairs are used to estimate parameters of a 3-D conformal transformation model, which is employed to rectify the input DEM. The accuracy of CP detection was assessed using two DEM subsets of different terrains. The results of six tests showed that the maximum shift and rotation errors were about 2 m (1/45 pixel) and 0.006{$^\circ$}. The developed approach was used to co-register the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global DEM to the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission DEM at three locations. The results revealed that both the mean absolute error and the standard deviation of the elevation differences were reduced for all the tests after co-registration, showing the good performance of the proposed method. Comparisons have also been made against previous works, which suggested that our results were consistent with the previous studies.},

The validation wind-tunnel experiments and field observations show high accuracy of our model in snow depth evaluation. Then we have analyzed the snow deposition patterns of complex terrain in detail. The results show different deposition patterns for snowfall and drifting snow, for deposition patterns for snowfall are controlled by both terrain and wind, while deposition patterns for drifting snow are mainly dominantly controlled by terrain, and the erosion or deposition rate is sensitive to the local wind speed. This work has considerable value in improving the accuracy of snow distribution prediction in alpine area, which we believe is essential for hydrological research of alpine catchments.},

This study investigates the accuracy of three most recently released 1-arcsec global DEMs (GDEMs, Copernicus, NASA and AW3D30) in five selected terrains of China, using more than 240,000 high-quality ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite) ALT08 points. The results indicate the three GDEMs have similar overall vertical accuracy, with RMSE of 6.73 (Copernicus), 6.59 (NASA) and 6.63 m (AW3D30). While the accuracy varies considerably over study areas and among GDEMs. The results show a clear correlation between the accuracy and terrain slopes, and some relationship between the accuracy and land covers. Our analysis reveals the land cover exerts a greater impact on the accuracy than that of the terrain slope for the study area. Visual inspections of terrain representation indicate Copernicus DEM exhibits the greatest detail of terrain, followed by AW3D30, and then by NASADEM. This study has demonstrated that ICESat-2 altimetry offers an important tool for DEM assessment. The findings provide a timely and comprehensive understanding of the quality of newly released GDEMs, which are informative for the selection of suitable DEMs, and for the improvement of GDEM in future studies.},

However, raw DEM data are often misaligned with each other, due to georeferencing errors, and a co-registration procedure is required before DEM differencing. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of the two classical co-registration methods proposed by Nuth and K\&auml;\&auml;b (2011) and Rosenholm and Torlegard (1988) . The former is currently the most commonly used method in glacial studies, while the latter is a seminal work in the photogrammetric field that has not been extensively investigated by the cryosphere community. Furthermore, we also present a new residual correction method using a generalized additive model (GAM) to eliminate the remaining systematic errors in DEM co-registration results. The performance of the two DEM co-registration methods and three residual correction algorithms (the GAM-based method together with two parametric-model-based methods) was evaluated using 23 Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) DEM pairs from the western margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet. The experimental results confirm our theoretical analysis of the two co-registration methods. The method of Rosenholm and Torlegard has a greater ability to remove DEM misalignments (4.6 \% on average and 15.3 \% maximum) because it models the translation, scale, and rotation-induced biases, while the method of Nuth and K\&auml;\&auml;b considers translation only. The proposed GAM-based method performs statistically better than the two residual correction methods based on parametric regression models (high-order polynomials and the sum of the sinusoidal functions). A visual inspection reveals that the GAM-based method, as a non-parametric regression technique, can capture complex systematic errors in the DEM co-registration residuals.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {In this study, the Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) land surface temperature (LST) environmental data record (EDR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) L2 swath LST products (collection 5) from both the Terra and Aqua satellites were evaluated against ground observations in an arid area of northwest China during the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER) experiment. Four barren surface sites were chosen for the evaluation, which took place from June 2012 to April 2013. The results show that the current VIIRS LST products demonstrate a reasonable accuracy, with an average bias of 0.36 K and -0.58 K and an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.74 K and 1.48 K for the four sites during daytime and nighttime, respectively. The accuracy of the nighttime LST is much better than that of daytime. Furthermore, it was also found that the VIIRS split-window (SW) algorithm provides better performance than the VIIRS dual split-window (DSW) algorithm during both daytime and nighttime. For MODIS LST products, the results show that both Terra and Aqua MODIS C5 LST products underestimate the LST for the four barren surface sites at daytime, and the biases and RMSEs are much larger for Aqua, with biases varies from -0.91 K to -3.13 K for Terra and from -1.31 K to -3.76 K for Aqua.},

  abstract = {Deep water subsalt fields and prospects typically have seismic imaging challenges, and significant effort has been invested over the last few decades to overcome these challenges. Substantial imaging quality advancements have recently been achieved using deep water OBN (Ocean Bottom Node) acquisitions. However, these surveys have been limited to focused reservoir imaging and monitoring due to high operational costs. In the last decade, OBN technology has improved by addressing inefficiencies, including longer node battery life and faster deployment/retrieval methods, such as dual ROV (Remote Operated Vehicle) operation.},

  abstract = {The incompleteness of the stratigraphical record is well documented, and the concept of ``missing time'' has attracted renewed attention in recent years. However, the importance of ``missing section'', comprising rock sequences that were deposited and removed within time intervals for which no rock is now preserved, is not so widely appreciated. We focus here on studies showing that in diverse regions, many of which are regarded as free of tectonic influences over intervals of 10s to 100 s of millions of years, kilometre-scale thicknesses of rock have been deposited and subsequently removed, typically within a few tens of Myr, leaving little or no trace of their former presence in the preserved rock record. Much of the evidence for these episodes comes from low temperature thermochronology (LTT) studies of basement regions including passive continental margins, ancient orogens and cratons. Such studies have commonly been carried out within a framework of continuous slow cooling, on the assumption that denudation of these supposedly tectonically stable regions is mainly a response to changes in climate and isostatic response to erosion. In many regions, integration of LTT results with geological evidence, principally the presence of remnants of sedimentary cover and erosion surfaces, shows that histories involving long-term slow cooling/denudation are not appropriate. Instead, histories involving repeated episodes of burial and exhumation/ heating and cooling, appear to be common in these supposedly tectonically inactive regions. During these episodes, thicknesses of several kilometres may be deposited and subsequently removed, returning the underlying rock to the surface or close to it. These events affect areas of many 1000s of km2, and may affect neighbouring regions on a continental scale more or less synchronously. They may affect both basement regions and adjacent sedimentary basins. The resulting unconformities, including erosion surfaces in basement, are often very low angle in nature, reflecting the spatial scale of the affected regions, and are often mistakenly regarded as representing periods of stability. Apparent long-term preservation of elevated topography and preservation of exposed ancient landscapes have been regarded by many as enigmatic. However, both can be understood in terms of vertical motions similar to those revealed from LTT. A number of studies point to the conclusions that regions of supposedly long-lived elevated topography have been uplifted relatively recently and ancient surfaces have been preserved by burial and uncovered as a result of relatively recent exhumation. The concept of km-scale ``missing section'' has been regarded with scepticism by many geologists, on the basis that there is no evidence that a significant cover was ever present. But the evidence exists in the form of data from a variety of paleo-thermal and paleo-burial techniques. Some of the earliest geologists recognised the importance of former geological sequences that are no longer present. We suggest that serious consideration should be given to explaining this behaviour, rather than dismissing it as unrealistic. Intra-plate stresses from far-field plate boundary interactions and/or processes related to mantle circulation may explain the processes involved in producing episodic kilometre-scale burial and exhumation. We present a new 3D shear-wave velocity model and Moho map of Scandinavia, which is based on the inversion of the merged phase dispersion curves from ambient noise and earthquake-generated Rayleigh waves. A classic two step inversion scheme is used where first maps of phase velocities at different periods are derived, and then a 1D transdimensional Bayesian method is applied to determine the VSV-depth structure. We assess the question of what compensates for the unusual high Scandes mountains and aim to identify the different tectonic domains of the adjacent continental lithosphere (Baltic Shield). While the southern Scandes lacks a pronounced crustal root, we observe a crustal root below the northern Scandes that is decreasing towards the central Scandes. A {$\sim$}10 km thick high-density lower crustal layer is present below the northern Scandes and generally thickening to the east below the Baltic Shield. The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) below the Scandes is deepening as well from west to east with a sharp step and a strong VSV decrease with depth of 9\% in the north and of 5.5\% in the south. The LAB of the thinner lithosphere is at 150 km depth in the north and varies from 90 to 120 km depth in the south. Both LAB steps coincide with the mountain front. The central area shows rather smoothly varying structures (170 km LAB depth, -4\% VSV with depth) towards the east and no clear spatial match with the front. We infer therefore distinct uplift mechanisms along the Scandes. The southern Scandes might sustain their topography due to dynamic support from the mantle, while the northern Scandes experience both crustal and mantle lithosphere isostasy. In both cases, we suspect a dynamic support from small-scale edge-driven convection that developed at the sharp lithospheric steps. Beneath the Archean Karelia craton in northern Finland, we find low-velocity areas below 150 km depth while a 250 km deep lithospheric keel is imaged below the Paleoproterozic southern Finland. The Norrbotten craton in northern Sweden can be identified at mantle depths as a unit different from the Karelia craton, Scandes and Paleoproterozic central Sweden. Based on new geochronological (amino acids and Sr-isotopes) and lithological data combined with analyses of 3D seismic data, the Pliocene-Pleistocene development of the central northern North Sea has been investigated. At the start of the Plio-Pleistocene Transition the study area was dominated by a deltaic, shallow marine or tidal depositional environment with sediments mainly sourced from the west. These sand-rich sediments include green glauconitic grains that belong to the Utsira Sand with a local provenance. Directly above the base Quaternary (R2) a 60 m thick layer of mud-rich sediments of glacimarine origin were deposited at a rate of {$\sim$}12 cm/ka between {$\sim$}2{\textendash}1.5 Ma and up to 80 cm/ka between 1.5 and 1.2 Ma possibly reflecting glacial ice advancing to the Norwegian coastline. The high rate of deposition in the Early Pleistocene occurred immediately before the initiation of the Norwegian Channel Ice Stream at {$\sim$}1.1 Ma. Following this, a large part of the sediment input from Fennoscandia seems to have been directed away from the study area to the shelf break. At the start of the Mid Pleistocene Transition (MPT), subaerial conditions allowed the formation of a {$>$}50 km long fluvial channel across the study area draining water from the east to the south west. The earliest evidence of grounded ice in the investigated area comes from mega scale glacial lineations formed during the MPT, at or just after {$\sim$}1.2 Ma. Following this, a regional unconformity (R4) was formed by one or more grounded ice advances across the study area possibly during or directly after the MPT and likely marks the boundary between the Early and Mid Pleistocene glacimarine sediments. The Mid to Late Pleistocene stratigraphy is dominated by glacimarine sediments and tills and is associated with multiple generations of tunnel valleys observed within the seismic data. A high shear strength till containing chalk clasts transported from the west and/or south of the study area was likely deposited during MIS6 and may have been more conducive to tunnel valley formation in comparison to lower shear strength tills deposited by later ice advances. A thick till unit overlain by a sand layer in the study area was deposited by grounded ice during the Last Glacial Maximum and subsequent drainage of an ice dammed lake in the southern North Sea during the last deglaciation (MIS2) of the study area. This study shows that much of the Quaternary age sediments within the northern North Sea were deposited relatively rapidly during short periods of time probably leaving significant hiatuses within the stratigraphic record. This finding has implications for previous studies that use a chronological framework assuming a relatively continuous sedimentation rate and record for the Early Pleistocene within the North Sea. Elevated plateaux and deeply incised valleys characterise the large-scale landscapes along the East Greenland margin as in many elevated, passive continental margins around the world. The absence of syn- or post-rift rocks in, for example, the mountains of Norway, hampers the assessment of the age of these landscapes and of the present-day elevation. The mountains of southern East Greenland (68{\textendash}71{$^\circ$}N), however, expose thick basalts that were extruded onto a largely horizontal lava plain near sea level during breakup of the NE Atlantic at the Paleocene{\textendash}Eocene transition. We take advantage of these favourable geological conditions to investigate the uplift history after continental breakup. In particular, it is clear that present-day elevations of these basalts up to 3.7 km above sea level (a.s.l.) were reached after breakup. We have mapped regional erosion surfaces and integrated the information about the landscape with the stratigraphic record (i.e. stratigraphic landscape analysis). The analysis led to the following relative denudation chronology for southern East Greenland: At breakup, the margin subsided and underwent km-scale burial. Around the Eocene{\textendash}Oligocene transition, the first phase of uplift, tilting and subsequent erosion led to the formation of an extensive, low-relief erosion surface (the Upper Planation Surface, UPS) that was graded towards the base level of the adjacent ocean before the eruption of Miocene lavas onto that surface. A second uplift that most likely occurred after the Miocene produced a new erosion surface (the Lower Planation Surface, LPS) by incision below the UPS. Finally, a third event in the late Cenozoic lifted the UPS and the LPS to their present elevations of up to 3 and 2 km a.s.l., respectively and shaped the present-day valleys and fjords by incision of rivers and glaciers below the LPS. The general picture of landscape development is highly similar to West Greenland and the common characteristics between the stepped landscapes in East Greenland and those on the conjugate margin in Scandinavia lead us to conclude that the mountains of Norway also formed after the North Atlantic breakup. We analyse travel times of shear waves, which were recorded at the MAGNUS network, to determine the 3D shear wave velocity (vS) structure underneath Southern Scandinavia. The travel time residuals are corrected for the known crustal structure of Southern Norway and weighted to account for data quality and pick uncertainties. The resulting residual pattern of subvertically incident waves is very uniform and simple. It shows delayed arrivals underneath Southern Norway compared to fast arrivals underneath the Oslo Graben and the Baltic Shield. The 3D upper mantle vS structure underneath the station network is determined by performing non-linear travel time tomography. As expected from the residual pattern the resulting tomographic model shows a simple and continuous vS perturbation pattern: a negative vS anomaly is visible underneath Southern Norway relative to the Baltic Shield in the east with a contrast of up to 4\% vS and a sharp W{\textendash}E dipping transition zone. Reconstruction tests reveal besides vertical smearing a good lateral reconstruction of the dipping vS transition zone and suggest that a deep-seated anomaly at 330{\textendash}410 km depth is real and not an inversion artefact. The upper part of the reduced vS anomaly underneath Southern Norway (down to 250 km depth) might be due to an increase in lithospheric thickness from the Caledonian Southern Scandes in the west towards the Proterozoic Baltic Shield in Sweden in the east. The deeper-seated negative vS anomaly (330{\textendash}410 km depth) could be caused by a temperature anomaly possibly combined with effects due to fluids or hydrous minerals. The determined simple 3D vS structure underneath Southern Scandinavia indicates that mantle processes might influence and contribute to a Neogene uplift of Southern Norway. The major zone of continental{\textendash}continental collision on Earth today is along the Alpine{\textendash}Himalayan Chain, which is home to the Pyrenees, European Alps, Turkish-Iranian Plateau, the Himalaya, and the Tibetan Plateau. Continental{\textendash}continental collision also occurs in the Southern Alps of New Zealand and has produced a number of ancient orogens, including the Appalachians, Urals, and Caledonides. The extensive, long-lived deformation, and particularly the crustal thickening, and therefore weakening, associated with continental collisions results in unique tectonic geomorphology. An important topic in understanding the tectonic geomorphology of continental{\textendash}continental collision zones is whether or not flux, topographic, thermal, or exhumational steady state can be achieved and how each can be recognized. Another subject of study is the relative controls of tectonics and climate on range width and asymmetry. Tectonic geomorphology has also been used to identify the lateral transport of crust, either brittlely, along strike{\textendash}slip faults, or ductilely, through lower crustal flow. Drainage reorganization is a particularly powerful tool for inferring uplift patterns. Geomorphologic studies also yield insights into lithospheric foundering. Finally, tectonic geomorphology can help explain the persistence of topography over long-innactive orogens. In this contribution these topics are explored on an orogen-by-orogen basis.},

  abstract = {Three equations derived from a close exponential glacier-climate relationship at the equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) of Norwegian glaciers have been utilized and implemented in a geographical information system (GIS). The first equation enables calculation of the minimum altitude of areas climatically suited for glacier formation at present, and is termed the altitude of instantaneous glacierization (AIG). Equation (2) is based on the `principle of terrain adaptation', enabling quantification of the glacial buildup sensitivity (GBS) in an area. The third equation calculates the theoretical climatic (instrumental) temperature-precipitation ELA (CTP-ELA) in presently non-glaciated areas by combining GBS with terrain altitude. The presented approach is primarily intended for palaeoclimatic analyses of former glacial records, and is tested here based on a plot of 122 temperature stations and 197 precipitation stations during the climate normal period 1961-1990 which has been recalculated to sea level using empirical vertical climatic gradients. These data were interpolated in the GIS using an `inverse square interpolation' routine. Subsequently, the interpolated climatic data were recalculated to the terrain surface using vertical climatic gradients and a digital elevation model (DEM) of southern Norway (resolution 5 X 5 degree minutes/c. 1 km2). The present glacier distribution in southern Norway is reproduced in great detail, and maps showing the modem GBS and CTP-ELA in non-glacierized areas of southern Norway are presented. Based on the GBS analysis, four scenarios with ELA depressions of 150 m (average `Little Ice Age' conditions), 500 m (average coastal Younger Dryas conditions), 1000 m (suggested late Weichselian maximum coastal conditions) and 1500 m are shown.},

More than a billion people rely on water from snow, most of which originates in the Northern Hemisphere mountain ranges. Yet, remote sensing observations of mountain snow depth are still lacking at the large scale. Here, we show the ability of Sentinel-1 to map snow depth in the Northern Hemisphere mountains at 1\,km{$^2$} resolution using an empirical change detection approach. An evaluation with measurements from {\textasciitilde}4000 sites and reanalysis data demonstrates that the Sentinel-1 retrievals capture the spatial variability between and within mountain ranges, as well as their inter-annual differences. This is showcased with the contrasting snow depths between 2017 and 2018 in the US Sierra Nevada and European Alps. With Sentinel-1 continuity ensured until 2030 and likely beyond, these findings lay a foundation for quantifying the long-term vulnerability of mountain snow-water resources to climate change.},

  abstract = {Seasonal snow is an essential water resource in many mountain regions. However, the spatio-temporal variability in mountain snow depth or snow water equivalent (SWE) at regional to global scales is not well understood due to the lack of high-resolution satellite observations and robust retrieval algorithms. We investigate the ability of the Sentinel-1 mission to monitor snow depth at sub-kilometer (100 m, 500 m, and 1 km) resolutions over the European Alps for 2017{\textendash}2019. The Sentinel-1 backscatter observations, especially in cross-polarization, show a high correlation with regional model simulations of snow depth over Austria and Switzerland. The observed changes in radar backscatter with the accumulation or ablation of snow are used in an empirical change detection algorithm to retrieve snow depth. The algorithm includes the detection of dry and wet snow conditions. Compared to in situ measurements at 743 sites in the European Alps, dry snow depth retrievals at 500 m and 1 km resolution have a spatio-temporal correlation of 0.89. The mean absolute error equals 20 \%{\textendash}30 \% of the measured values for snow depths between 1.5 and 3 m. The performance slightly degrades for retrievals at the finer 100 m spatial resolution as well as for retrievals of shallower and deeper snow. The results demonstrate the ability of Sentinel-1 to provide snow estimates in mountainous regions where satellite-based estimates of snow mass are currently lacking. The retrievals can improve our knowledge of seasonal snow mass in areas with complex topography and benefit a number of applications, such as water resource management, flood forecasting, and numerical weather prediction. However, future research is recommended to further investigate the physical basis of the sensitivity of Sentinel-1 backscatter observations to snow accumulation.},

However, the evolution of permafrost over longer time periods, such as the Holocene, is unknown, but is considered to have significance for landscape development and geomorphological processes in high mountain areas of Scandinavia. In this study two mean annual air temperature series covering the Holocene have been compiled to drive a 1D heat flow model over a 10kyr period for several sites in Norway. At each site temperature-monitored boreholes exist, which were used to calibrate the model. In addition the spatial distribution of permafrost during selected time periods of the Holocene was addressed using a newly implemented version of an equilibrium permafrost model. The result of this study indicates an altitudinal zonation of relative permafrost age in Norway. We find that permafrost has existed continuously since the deglaciation at the highest altitudes, whereas in large areas where permafrost currently is present, it degraded during the Holocene thermal maximum (HTM). In all boreholes the coldest simulated permafrost occurred during the `Little Ice Age' (LIA), and also the largest areal distribution of Holocene permafrost in Norway seems to be connected to the LIA.},

In southern Norway, permafrost landforms are restricted to high elevations and the majority of the landforms are connected to glacial activity and classified as active.

  abstract = {Abstract To improve the depiction of autumn through spring land{\textendash}atmosphere interactions and feedbacks within regional and global weather, climate, and hydrologic models, a Subgrid SNOW Distribution (SSNOWD) submodel that explicitly includes subgrid snow-depth and snow-cover variability has been developed. From both atmospheric and hydrologic perspectives, the subgrid snow-depth distribution is an important quantity to account for within large-scale models. In the natural system, these subgrid snow-depth distributions are largely responsible for the mosaic of snow-covered and snow-free areas that develop as the snow melts, and the impacts of these fractional areas must be quantified in order to realistically simulate grid-averaged surface fluxes. SSNOWD's formulation incorporates observational studies showing that snow distributions can be described by a lognormal distribution and the snow-depth coefficient of variation. Using an understanding of the physical processes that lead to these observed snow-depth variations, a global distribution of nine subgrid snow-depth-variability categories was developed, and coefficient-of-variation values were assigned to each category based on published measurements. In addition, SSNOWD adopts the physically realistic approach of performing separate surface-energy-balance calculations over the snow-covered and snow-free portions of each model grid cell and weighing the resulting fluxes according to these fractional areas. Using a climate version of the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (ClimRAMS) over a North American domain, SSNOWD was compared with a snow-cover formulation similar to those currently used in most general circulation models. The simulations indicated that accounting for snow-distribution variability has a significant impact on snow-cover evolution and associated energy and moisture fluxes.},

  abstract = {Abstract SnowModel is a spatially distributed snow-evolution modeling system designed for application in landscapes, climates, and conditions where snow occurs. It is an aggregation of four submodels: MicroMet defines meteorological forcing conditions, EnBal calculates surface energy exchanges, SnowPack simulates snow depth and water-equivalent evolution, and SnowTran-3D accounts for snow redistribution by wind. Since each of these submodels was originally developed and tested for nonforested conditions, details describing modifications made to the submodels for forested areas are provided. SnowModel was created to run on grid increments of 1 to 200 m and temporal increments of 10 min to 1 day. It can also be applied using much larger grid increments, if the inherent loss in high-resolution (subgrid) information is acceptable. Simulated processes include snow accumulation; blowing-snow redistribution and sublimation; forest canopy interception, unloading, and sublimation; snow-density evolution; and snowpack melt. Conceptually, SnowModel includes the first-order physics required to simulate snow evolution within each of the global snow classes (i.e., ice, tundra, taiga, alpine/mountain, prairie, maritime, and ephemeral). The required model inputs are 1) temporally varying fields of precipitation, wind speed and direction, air temperature, and relative humidity obtained from meteorological stations and/or an atmospheric model located within or near the simulation domain; and 2) spatially distributed fields of topography and vegetation type. SnowModel's ability to simulate seasonal snow evolution was compared against observations in both forested and nonforested landscapes. The model closely reproduced observed snow-water-equivalent distribution, time evolution, and interannual variability patterns.},

  abstract = {We present a generalized version of SnowTran-3D (version 2.0), that simulates wind-related snow distributions over the range of topographic and climatic environments found globally. This version includes three primary enhancements to the original Liston and Sturm (1998) model: (1) an improved wind sub-model, (2) a two-layer sub-model describing the spatial and temporal evolution of friction velocity that must be exceeded to transport snow (the threshold friction velocity) and (3) implementation of a three-dimensional, equilibrium-drift profile sub-model that forces SnowTran-3D snow accumulations to duplicate observed drift profiles. These three sub-models allow SnowTran-3D to simulate snow-transport processes in variable topography and different snow climates. In addition, SnowTran-3D has been coupled to a high-resolution, spatially distributed meteorological model (MicroMet) to provide more realistic atmospheric forcing data. MicroMet distributes data (precipitation, wind speed and direction, air temperature and relative humidity) obtained from meteorological stations and/or atmospheric models located within or near the simulation domain. SnowTran-3D has also been coupled to a spatially distributed energy- and mass-balance snow-evolution modeling system (SnowModel) designed for application in any landscape and climate where snow is found. SnowTran-3D is typically run using temporal increments ranging from 1 hour to 1 day, horizontal grid increments ranging from 1 to 100 m and time-spans ranging from individual storms to entire snow seasons.},

The domain included rolling uplands and a flat coastal plain. Simulations were produced for the winters of 1994/95, 1995/96, and 1996/97. The model, which accounts for spatial and temporal variations in blowing-snow sublimation, as well as saltation and turbulent-suspended transport, was driven with interpolated fields of observed temperature, humidity, and wind speed and direction. Model outputs include local (a few hundreds of meters) to regional (several tens of kilometers) distributions of winter snow-water-equivalent depths and blowing-snow sublimation losses, from which the regional winter precipitation distributions are computed. At regional scales, the end-of-winter snow depth is largely equal to the difference between winter precipitation and moisture ...},

  abstract = {With the advent of the next generation of space-based laser altimeters, ICESat-2 and GEDI, we are entering an exciting era of active remote sensing of forests that offers unprecedented opportunities for the observation of forest structure. Consistent comparisons of the accuracy of terrain and canopy height retrievals for these two missions are essential for continued improvement and further application. Because the time interval between the spaceborne products and validation data may introduce additional errors, we validate the newly released GEDI L2A product (version 2) and the ICESat-2 ATL08 product (version 4) using high-resolution, locally calibrated airborne lidar products acquired in the same year (2019) as the reference datasets. In addition, our study area contains 40 sites located in the U.S. mainland, Alaska, and Hawaii that encompass a variety of eco-climatic zones and vegetation cover types; thus, it avoids the uncertainties associated with small sample sizes and restricted spatial coverage. The results show that ICESat-2 and GEDI yield reasonable estimates of terrain height, with root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of 2.24 and 4.03 m for mid and low latitudes, respectively, and 0.98 m for high latitudes (ICESat-2 only). ICESat-2 outperforms GEDI across the board for terrain height retrieval, although they both have better accuracy than existing SRTM and GMTED DEM products. Analyses of the error factors suggest that steep slopes ({$>$}30‚ó¶) present the greatest challenge for both GEDI and ICESat-2; in addition, tall ({$>$}20 m) and dense canopies ({$>$}90\%) forest ecosystems also reduce the accuracy of the terrain height estimates. When ICESat2 and GEDI data are used for canopy height retrieval, the use of only strong/power beam data acquired at night is recommended, as the overall RMSEs decrease from 7.21 and 5.02 m to 3.93 and 3.56 m, respectively, compared to using all data regardless of daytime and beam strength. GEDI outperforms ICESat-2 across the board for canopy height retrieval, as ICESat-2 has a larger potential bias for almost all forest types and cover conditions. ICESat-2 tends to overestimate the canopy height of dwarf shrublands and underestimate the canopy height of forest, and there is a gradual downward shift in the distribution of residuals with increasing canopy height. Overall, ICESat-2 with photon counting technology and GEDI with full waveform technology each represent the state of the art in spaceborne laser altimeters for terrain and canopy height retrieval. Combined, these two missions can take advantage of the unique strengths of each instrument.},

  abstract = {Over the past decades, climate change has exerted pronounced influences on the cryo-hydrologic environments in High Mountain Asia (HMA). Digital elevation models (DEMs) are one of the critical datasets required in many hydrology- and cryosphere-related studies in HMA, which include estimations of glacier mass balances and lake water storage changes and hydrological runoff modelling. Several global or near-global coverage DEMs (e.g. SRTM and ASTER missions) have been widely utilized for such studies. However, a comprehensive assessment of the quality of these DEMs, particularly over the high-relief HMA area, is still lacking. This study investigated the performances of seven public freely-accessed DEM datasets (ASTER GDEM V2, SRTM-3 V4.1 DEM, SRTM-1 DEM, AW3D30 DEM, VFP-DEM, MERIT DEM, Seamless SRTM-1 DEM) over the HMA region by referring to high-accuracy elevation data from ICESat altimetry. We also provided an additional detailed assessment for typical lake basins and extremely rugged areas in the Himalayas by using available global positioning system (GPS) measurements and gridded SETSM DEM raster data. Results show that AW3D30 exhibits the highest accuracy in HMA land areas among these datasets. The accuracy of all studied DEMs demonstrates high spatial variation, which shows the strongest relationship with slope among several topographical factors, such as elevation and aspect. Over these rugged terrains with a large slope, such as the Hengduan Mountains and Himalayas, the vertical accuracy is relatively low in all investigated DEMs. We established empirical models for fitting the relationship between DEM vertical error and mean slope, which can be used to estimate the average elevation errors for any given local or basin-scale DEM grids. In addition, this study identified regions with anomalous elevation data in each dataset caused by the imperfect void-filling processing scheme. In sum, the 3-arc-second MERIT DEM is judged to be relatively dependable for HMA which not only achieves good performances in statistical error values but also retains few void-filling anomalies. The 1-arc-second AW3D30 could be the most promising product over HMA with its high spatial resolution and accuracy, although some void-filling anomalies need to be noted in some regions.},

With the recently released TanDEM-X 90-m DEM and AW3D30 version 2.2, the open global or near-global coverage DEM datasets have been further expanded. However, the quality of these DEMs has not yet been fully characterized, especially in the application for regional scale studies. In this study, we assess the quality of five freely available global DEM datasets (SRTM-1 DEM, SRTM-3 DEM, ASTER GDEM2, AW3D30 DEM and TanDEM-X 90-m DEM) and one 30-m resampled TanDEM-X DEM (hereafter called TDX30) over the south-central Chinese province of Hunan. Then, the newly-released high precision ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2) altimetry points are introduced to evaluate the accuracy of these DEMs. Results show that the SRTM1 DEM offers the best quality with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 8.0 m, and ASTER GDEM2 has the worst quality with the RMSE of 10.1 m. We also compared the vertical accuracies of these DEMs with respect to different terrain morphological characteristics (e.g., elevation, slope and aspect) and land cover types. It reveals that the DEM accuracy decreases when the terrain elevation and slope value increase, whereas no relationship was found between DEM error and terrain aspect. Furthermore, the results show that the accuracy increases as the land cover type changes from vegetated to non-vegetated. Overall, the SRTM1 DEM, with high spatial resolution and high vertical accuracy, is currently the most promising dataset among these DEMs and it could, therefore, be utilized for the studies and applications requiring accurate DEMs.},

  abstract = {Estimations of reservoir bathymetry and storage are of great significance due to their substantial impacts on hydrological processes and water resource management. However, existing approaches for reservoir bathymetry construction often rely on field measurements, which restricts their application at regional and global scales. This study proposes a novel Approach for Determining the BAthymetry and water storage of channel-type Reservoirs, hereafter referred to as ADBAR, for which only open-access digital elevation model (DEM) and satellite images are required. The basic idea of ADBAR is to utilize the geomorphological similarity and topographical continuity of the reservoir inundation area with its lateral valleys and upstream/downstream regions to predict underwater bathymetry. Forty-eight reservoirs with different topographic and geometric characteristics were selected for method validation. The selected reservoirs were all impounded after the year 2000, so the modeled reservoir bathymetry can be validated by the ``reference'' reservoir storage calculated using the exposed topography in SRTM DEM and the mapped water extents from spectral images. The difference between the estimated and reference storages is approximately 13.23\% on average. Furthermore, the modeled results in two selected basins with dense reservoir distributions, the Upper Yellow River Basin, and the Tocantins River Basin, are comparable with the documented effective storage capacities. The validations for both individual reservoirs and the two large basins demonstrate that ADBAR is a robust tool for estimating reservoir bathymetries and storage capacities, and thus facilitates the modeling of reservoir impacts on water budgets at large and global scales.},

The proposed method can correctly aggregate one-to-many (1:N) and many-to-many (M:N) potential matching pairs using contextual information in the presence of positional discrepancies and a high spatial distribution density. This method iteratively detects new landmark pairs (matched pairs), based on the prior landmark pairs as references, until all landmark pairs are obtained. Our approach has been experimentally validated using two topographic datasets at 1:50 and 1:10k. It outperformed a method based on a back-propagation neural network. The precision increased by 4.5\% and the recall increased by 21.6\%, respectively.},

The validation showed that MODIS-derived LSWTs and in situ water temperatures were significantly correlated, with a coefficient of determination higher than 0.96 and a root mean square error between 1.2‚ó¶C and 1.8‚ó¶C. These results indicate MODIS LST products can be used to assess the spatial and temporal thermal behavior of Lake Taihu. A spatial analysis of daytime LSWT showed different thermal zones along the lake due to the differential heat storage capacity between the deep and shallow regions of the lake, such as the littoral and East Lake Taihu. In contrast, the nighttime LSWT showed little variation, and there was a uniform surface water temperature. Following a change in solar radiation, the annual cycle of the average LSWT (with a nearly 24‚ó¶C range) started to increase in January and peaked in July. In Lake Taihu, the mean nighttime LSWT from July to September rapidly warmed over the period of 2002{\textendash}2013 at an average rate of 0.059 {$\pm$} 0.053‚ó¶C/year.

Here, we apply downscaled hydrologic simulations from 28 climate model projections to show that by mid-century (2036{\textendash}2065), 69\% of historically snowmelt-dominated areas of the western United States see a decline in the ability of snow to predict seasonal drought, increasing to 83\% by late century (2070{\textendash}2099). Reduced predictability arises when peak snowpack approaches zero or because of decreased warm-season runoff efficiency. Changes in drought prediction skill show significant (P\,{$<$}\,0.01) elevation dependence, with lower-elevation coastal areas most impacted by warming. Ancillary predictive information can only partially mitigate snow-based predictability losses to 65\% of areas, underscoring the importance of declining future snowpack.},

  abstract = {The energy sector is highly dependent on climate variability for electricity generation, maintenance activities and demand. In recent years, a few climate services have appeared that provide tailored information for the energy sector. In particular, seasonal climate predictions of wind speed have proven useful to the wind power industry. However, most of the service users are ultimately interested in forecasts of electricity generation instead of wind. Although power generation depends on many factors other than wind conditions, the capacity factor is a suitable indicator to quantify the impact of wind variability on production. In this paper a methodology to produce seasonal predictions of capacity factor for a range of turbine classes is proposed for the first time. The strengths and weaknesses of the method are discussed and the forecast quality is evaluated for an application example over Europe.},

This article proposes a coregistration method based on the stochastic parallel gradient descent (SPGD) algorithm. Stochastic parallel perturbations are imposed on the translation coefficients of the polynomial coregistration model to make the performance evaluation function converge to a global extremum, which allows the translation coefficients to be obtained, and then the coregistration is achieved after resampling. Data processing of images from Kashgar and Mount Etna show that the proposed method is effective and robust. Furthermore, a series of experiments is designed to evaluate the convergence characteristics of the proposed method, which indicates that it has a stable convergence process and good robustness.},

To assess spatial variability at the plot scale, intensive snow depth sampling was conducted during January and April 2009 in 15 plots in the Rio {\'E}sera Valley, central Spanish Pyrenees Mountains. Each plot (10 {\texttimes} 10 m; 100 m\textsuperscript{2}) was subdivided into a grid of 1 m\textsuperscript{2} squares; sampling at the corners of each square yielded a set of 121 data points that provided an accurate measure of snow depth in the plot (considered as ground truth). The spatial variability of snow depth was then assessed using sampling locations randomly selected within each plot. The plots were highly variable, with coefficients of variation up to 0.25. This indicates that to improve the representativeness of snow depth sampling in a given plot the snow depth measurements should be increased in number and averaged when spatial heterogeneity is substantial. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Snow depth distributions were simulated at the same plot scale under varying levels of standard deviation and spatial autocorrelation, to enable the effect of each factor on snowpack representativeness to be established. The results showed that the snow depth estimation error increased markedly as the standard deviation increased. The results indicated that in general at least five snow depth measurements should be taken in each plot to ensure that the estimation error is \&lt;10 \%; this applied even under highly heterogeneous conditions. In terms of the spatial configuration of the measurements, the sampling strategy did not impact on the snow depth estimate under lack of spatial autocorrelation. However, with a high spatial autocorrelation a smaller error was obtained when the distance between measurements was greater.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The application of diffusion theory and Monte Carlo lidar radiative transfer simulations presented in Part I of this series of study suggests that snow depth can be derived from the first-, second- and third-order moments of the lidar backscattering pathlength distribution. These methods are now applied to the satellite ICESat-2 lidar measurements over the Arctic sea ice and land surfaces of Northern Hemisphere. Over the Arctic sea ice, the ICESat-2 retrieved snow depths agree well with co-located IceBridge snow radar measured values with a root-mean-square (RMS) difference of 7.8 cm or 29.2\% of the mean snow depth. The terrestrial snow depths derived from ICESat-2 show drastic spatial variation of the snowpack along ICESat-2 ground tracks over the Northern Hemisphere, which are consistent with the University of Arizona (UA) and Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) gridded daily snow products. The RMS difference in snow depths between ICESat-2 and UA gridded daily snow products is 14 cm, or 28\% of the mean UA snow depth. To better understand these results, we also discuss the possible sources of errors in ICESat-2 derived snow depths, including surface roughness within the laser footprint, atmospheric forward scattering, solar background noise, and detector dark current. Simulation results indicate that the snow depth errors would be less than 5 cm if the standard deviation of pulse spreading due to surface roughness is within 50 cm. Our results demonstrate that the ICESat-2 lidar measurements can be used to reliably derive snow depth, which is a critical geophysical parameter for cryosphere studies including sea ice thickness estimation and also provides important constraints in the modeling of terrestrial hydrological processes.},

The algorithm combines primary and high-order reflected energy and significantly enhances the image illumination and resolution compared to those of conventional migration. Least-squares full-wavefield migration (LS-FWM) directly computes the earth's reflectivity, thereby avoiding crosstalk noise often observed in imaging using high-order reflections. Iteratively solving an inversion problem is computationally intensive and can suffer from instability issues; however, we develop an efficient least-squares procedure by combining a fast and accurate one-way wave-equation propagator with an effective linear inversion solver. An advanced regularization method is also employed to stabilize the inversion by controlling the over-fitting problem. Successful applications to both synthetic and field data examples demonstrate that LS-FWM greatly improves the imaging illumination and resolution compared to conventional migration.},

Here we improve the interpretability of tree-based models through three main contributions. (1) A polynomial time algorithm to compute optimal explanations based on game theory. (2) A new type of explanation that directly measures local feature interaction effects. (3) A new set of tools for understanding global model structure based on combining many local explanations of each prediction. We apply these tools to three medical machine learning problems and show how combining many high-quality local explanations allows us to represent global structure while retaining local faithfulness to the original model. These tools enable us to (1) identify high-magnitude but low-frequency nonlinear mortality risk factors in the US population, (2) highlight distinct population subgroups with shared risk characteristics, (3) identify nonlinear interaction effects among risk factors for chronic kidney disease and (4) monitor a machine learning model deployed in a hospital by identifying which features are degrading the model's performance over time. Given the popularity of tree-based machine learning models, these improvements to their interpretability have implications across a broad set of domains.},

  abstract = {seNorge\_2018 is a collection of observational gridded datasets over Norway for daily total precipitation: daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures. The time period covers 1957 to 2017, and the data are presented over a high-resolution terrain-following grid with 1\&thinsp;km spacing in both meridional and zonal directions. The seNorge family of observational gridded datasets developed at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET Norway) has a 20-year-long history and seNorge\_2018 is its newest member, the first providing daily minimum and maximum temperatures. seNorge datasets are used for a wide range of applications in climatology, hydrology, and meteorology. The observational dataset is based on MET Norway's climate data, which have been integrated by the ``European Climate Assessment and Dataset'' database. Two distinct statistical interpolation methods have been developed, one for temperature and the other for precipitation. They are both based on a spatial scale-separation approach where, at first, the analysis (i.e., predictions) at larger spatial scales is estimated. Subsequently they are used to infer the small-scale details down to a spatial scale comparable to the local observation density. Mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures are interpolated separately; then physical consistency among them is enforced. For precipitation, in addition to observational data, the spatial interpolation makes use of information provided by a climate model. The analysis evaluation is based on cross-validation statistics and comparison with a previous seNorge version. The analysis quality is presented as a function of the local station density. We show that the occurrence of large errors in the analyses decays at an exponential rate with the increase in the station density. Temperature analyses over most of the domain are generally not affected by significant biases. However, during wintertime in data-sparse regions the analyzed minimum temperatures do have a bias between 2\&thinsp;{$\circ$}C and 3\&thinsp;{$\circ$}C. Minimum temperatures are more challenging to represent and large errors are more frequent than for maximum and mean temperatures. The precipitation analysis quality depends crucially on station density: the frequency of occurrence of large errors for intense precipitation is less than 5\% in data-dense regions, while it is approximately 30\&thinsp;\% in data-sparse regions. The open-access datasets are available for public download at daily total precipitation (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2082320, Lussana, 2018b); and daily mean (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2023997, Lussana, 2018c), maximum (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2559372, Lussana, 2018e), and minimum (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2559354, Lussana, 2018d) temperatures.},

  abstract = {ICESat-2 science requirements are dependent on the accurate real-time pointing control (i.e., geolocation control) and postprocessed geolocation knowledge of the laser altimeter surface returns. Prelaunch pointing alignment errors and postlaunch pointing alignment variation result in large geolocation errors that must be calibrated on orbit. In addition, the changing sun-orbit geometry causes thermal-mechanical forced laser frame alignment variations at the orbit period and trends from days, weeks, and months. Early mission analysis computed precise postlaunch laser beam alignment calibration. The alignment calibration was uploaded to the spacecraft and enabled the pointing control performance to achieve 4.4 {$\pm$} 6.0 m, a significant improvement over the 45 m (1 {$\sigma$}) mission requirement. Laser frame alignment calibrations are used to reduce the alignment bias and time variation, as well as the orbital variation contributions to geolocation knowledge error from 6 to 1.7 m (1 {$\sigma$}). Relative beam alignment of the six beams is calibrated and shown to contribute between 0.5 {$\pm$} 0.1 m and 2.4 {$\pm$} 0.2 m of remaining geolocation knowledge error. Independent geolocation assessment based on comparison to high-resolution digital elevation models agrees well with the calibration geolocation error estimates. The analysis demonstrates the ICESat-2 mission is performing far better than its geolocation knowledge requirement of 6.5 m (1 {$\sigma$}) after the laser frame alignment bias variation and orbital variation calibrations have been applied. Remaining geolocation error is beam dependent and ranges from 2.5 m for beam 6 to 4.4 m for beam 2 (mean + 1 {$\sigma$}).},

  abstract = {The recent development of high-resolution climate models offers a promising approach in improving the simulation of precipitation, clouds and temperature. However, higher grid spacing is also a promising feature to improve the simulation of snow cover. In particular, it provides a refined representation of topography and allows for an explicit simulation of convective precipitation processes. In this study we analyze the snow cover in a set of decade-long high-resolution climate simulation with horizontal grid spacing of 2.2 km over the greater Alpine region. Results are compared against observations and lower resolution models (12 and 50 km), which use parameterized convection. The simulations are integrated using the COSMO (Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling) model. The evaluation of snow water equivalent (SWE) in the simulation of present-day climate, driven by the ERA-Interim reanalysis, against an observational dataset, reveals that the high-resolution simulation clearly outperforms simulations with grid spacing of 12 and 50 km. The latter simulations underestimate the cumulative amount of SWE over Switzerland over the whole annual cycle by 33\% (12 km simulation) and 56\% (50 km simulation) while the high-resolution simulation shows a spatially and temporally averaged difference of less than 1\%. Scenario simulations driven by GCM MPI-ESM-LR (2081{\textendash}2090 RCP8.5 vs. 1991{\textendash}2000) reveal a strong decrease of SWE over the Alps, consistent with previous studies. Previous studies had found that the relative decrease becomes gradually smaller with elevation, but this finding was limited to low and intermediate altitudes (as a 12 km simulation resolves the topography up to 2500 m). In the current study we find that the height gradient reverses sign, and relative reductions in snow cover increases above 3000 m asl, where important parts of the cryosphere are present. In addition, the simulations project a transition from permanent to seasonal snow cover at high altitudes, with potentially important impacts to Alpine permafrost. This transition and the more pronounced decline of SWE emphasize the value of the higher grid spacing. Overall, we show that high-resolution climate models offer a promising approach in improving the simulation of snow cover in Alpine terrain.},

  abstract = {As wind energy increases its share of total electricity generation and its integration into the power system becomes more challenging, accurately representing the spatio-temporal variability in wind data becomes crucial. Wind fluctuations impact power and energy systems, e.g., energy system planning, vulnerability to storm shutdowns, and available voltage stability support. To analyze such fluctuations and their spatio-temporal dependencies, time series of wind speeds at hourly time-frequency or higher are needed. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of the global and mesoscale-model derived wind time series against observations by using a set of metrics that we present as requirements for wind energy integration studies. We also perform a sensitivity analysis to find the best model setup of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, focusing on evaluating the wind speed fluctuation metrics. The results show that using higher spatial resolution in the WRF model simulations improves the representation of temporal fluctuations; however, higher-resolution simulations often lower the correlations of wind time series with measurements. We also show that the nesting strategy is an important consideration, and a smoother transition from the forcing data to the nested domains improves the correlations with measurements. All mesoscale model simulations overestimate the value of the spatial correlations in wind speed with respect to their observed values. Still, the spatial correlations and the wind speed distributions are insensitive to the model configuration tested in this study.},

  abstract = {Accurate bathymetric data is essential for marine, coastal ecosystems, and related studies. In the past decades, a lot of studies were investigated to obtain bathymetric data in shallow waters using satellite remotely sensed data. Satellite multispectral imagery has been widely used to estimate shallow water depths based on empirical models and physics-based models. However, the in-situ water depth information is essential (as the priori) to use the empirical model in a specific area, which limits its application, especially for remote reefs. In this study, the bathymetric maps in shallow waters were produced based on empirical models with only satellite remotely sensed data (i.e., the new ICESat-2 bathymetric points and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery). The bathymetric points from the spaceborne ICESat-2 lidar were used in place of the in-situ auxiliary bathymetric points to train the classical empirical models (i.e., the linear model and the band ratio model). The bathymetric points were firstly extracted from noisy ICESat-2 raw data photons by an improved point cloud processing algorithm, and then were corrected for bathymetric errors (which were caused by the refraction effect in the water column, the refraction effect on the water surface, and the fluctuation effect on the water surface). With the trained empirical models and Sentinel-2 multispectral images, the bathymetric maps were produced for Yongle Atoll, in the South China Sea and the lagoon near Acklins Island and Long Cay, to the southeast of Bahama with four-date Sentinel-2 images. The bathymetry performance (including the accuracy and consistency of multi-date data) was evaluated and compared with the in-situ measurements. The results indicate that the bathymetric accuracy is well, and the RMSE is lower or close to 10\% of the maximum depth for the two models with four-date images in two study areas. The consistency of multi-date data is well with the mean R2 of 0.97. The main novelties of this study are that the accuracy bathymetric points can be obtained from the ICESat-2 raw data using the proposed signal processing and error correction method, and using the ICESat-2 bathymetric points, the satellite multispectral imagery based on empirical models is no longer limited by local priori measurements, which were essential in previous studies. Hence, In the future, with the help of free and open-access satellite data (i.e., ICESat-2 data and Sentinel-2 imagery), this approach can be extended to a larger scale to obtain bathymetric maps in the shallow water of coastal areas, surroundings of islands and reefs, and inland waters.},

The spatial distribution of radar based snow depth allows a clear distinction of three zones of different accumulation characteristics: (1) The lower part of Findel Glacier shows a clear altitudinal trend while (2) the upper part has no trend in altitude but high spatial fluctuations in snow depth. (3) Adler Glacier's accumulation characteristics are similar to zone (2). However, despite their close vicinity, accumulation on (3) is reduced by 40\% compared to (2). The observed strong spatial variability emphasises the need for spatially continuous measurements for studies involving accumulation on glaciers. Finally, reasons for observed variations (e.g., preferential snow deposition and snow redistribution) are discussed.},

However, MCMC cannot be practically applied to large data sets because of the prohibitive cost of evaluating every likelihood term at every iteration. Here we present Firefly Monte Carlo (FlyMC) an auxiliary variable MCMC algorithm that only queries the likelihoods of a potentially small subset of the data at each iteration yet simulates from the exact posterior distribution, in contrast to recent proposals that are approximate even in the asymptotic limit. FlyMC is compatible with a wide variety of modern MCMC algorithms, and only requires a lower bound on the per-datum likelihood factors. In experiments, we find that FlyMC generates samples from the posterior more than an order of magnitude faster than regular MCMC, opening up MCMC methods to larger datasets than were previously considered feasible.},

The PDS model assumes a generalized Pareto distribution for modeling threshold exceedances corresponding to a generalized extreme value distribution for annual maxima. The performance of the two models in terms of the uncertainty of the T-year event estimator is evaluated in the cases of estimation with, respectively, the maximum likelihood (ML) method, the method of moments (MOM), and the method of probability weighted moments (PWM). In the case of ML estimation, the PDS model provides the most efficient T-year event estimator. In the cases of MOM and PWM estimation, the PDS model is generally preferable for negative shape parameters, whereas the AMS model yields the most efficient estimator for positive shape parameters. A comparison of the considered methods reveals that in general, one should use the PDS model with MOM estimation for negative shape parameters, the PDS model with exponentially distributed exceedances if the shape parameter is close to zero, the AMS model with MOM estimation for moderately positive shape parameters, and the PDS model with ML estimation for large positive shape parameters. Since heavy-tailed distributions, corresponding to negative shape parameters, are far the most common in hydrology, the PDS model generally is to be preferred for at-site quantile estimation.},

Remote sensing analysis provides a means to fill in these data gaps in order to glean a better understanding of the spatiotemporal water level changes across the CONUS. This study takes advantage of two-plus years of NASA's ICESat-2 (IS-2) ATLAS photon data (ATL03 products) in order to derive water level changes for {\textasciitilde}6200 overlapping lakes and reservoirs ({$>$}1 km2) in the CONUS. Interactive visualizations of large spatial datasets are becoming more commonplace as data volumes for new Earth observing sensors have markedly increased in recent years. We present such a visualization created from an automated cluster computing workflow that utilizes tens of billions of ATLAS photons which derives water level changes for all of the overlapping lakes and reservoirs in the CONUS. Furthermore, users of this interactive website can download segmented and clustered IS-2 ATL03 photons for each individual waterbody so that they may run their own analysis. We examine {\textasciitilde}19,000 IS-2 derived water level changes that are spatially and temporally coincident with water level changes from USGS gages and find high agreement with our results as compared to the in situ gage data.

  abstract = {The most prevalent global surface models are derived from space-based technologies. The spatial and temporal coverage of radar and imaging systems have sig\- nificant advantage over other sensors and platforms. However, these systems are often are challenged in certain environmental conditions to produce accurate elevations as compared to what might achieved with laser altimetry. Radar derived DEM (Digital Elevation Model) elevation accuracy is often less in vegetated regions, as the wavelengths associated with radar mapping missions do not fully penetrate the canopy. Elevation errors are also substantial over dynamic topography. Correction models using airborne lidar reference datasets can be effective for localized studies to improve the DEM but often the data is not readily available or seasonally/temporally irrelevant. This work presents an automated method for correcting digital terrain models derived from the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) elevation products using NASA's newest Earth observing laser altimeter, the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2). ICESat-2 elevations, in concert with Landsat 8 (global imagery), create a model based correction strategy for the SRTM derived elevations using geographically correlated canopy cover and surface slope information. The results are validated at the study site using high-resolution, high fidelity airborne lidar datasets as a reference surface. The application of the correction model on the radar measurements results in nearly 50\% improvement in elevation accuracy for this region. Additionally this established proof of concept provides a starting point for further research in how this method, with ICESat-2 data, can be extended to other environmental regions, other radar or image derived elevation products and inform future techniques for similar application at the global scale.},

The likelihood of future hiatus periods is found to be sensitive to the rate of change of anthropogenic forcing. Under high rates of greenhouse gas emissions there is little chance of a hiatus decade occurring beyond 2030, even in the event of a large volcanic eruption. We further demonstrate that most nonvolcanic hiatuses across Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) models are associated with enhanced cooling in the equatorial Pacific linked to the transition to a negative IPO phase.},

In this paper, we introduce BathyNet, an U-net like convolutional neural network, based on high-resolution, multispectral RGBC (red, green, blue, coastal blue) aerial images. The approach combines photogrammetric and radiometric methods: Preprocessing of the raw aerial images relies on strict ray tracing of the potentially oblique image rays, considering the intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters. The actual depth estimation exploits the radiometric image content in a deep learning framework. 3D water surface and water bottom models derived from simultaneously captured laser bathymetry point clouds serve as reference and training data for both image preprocessing and actual depth estimation. As such, the approach highlights the benefits of jointly processing data from hybrid active and passive imaging sensors. The RGBC images and laser data of four groundwater supplied lakes around Augsburg, Germany, captured in April 2018 served as the basis for testing and validating the approach. With systematic depth biases less than 15 cm and a standard deviation of around 40 cm, the results satisfy the vertical accuracy limit Bc7 defined by the International Hydrographic Organization. Further improvements are anticipated by extending BathyNet to include a simultaneous semantic segmentation branch.},

Optimization mechanics which updates the transform parameters in the iterative loop requires estimation of derivatives of the cost function to set-up update rules that retrieve the deformation model between the image pairs. Application of stochastic approximation of cost function and its derivatives for solving optimization problems while the objective function is non-differentiable or non-smooth or computed with noise is encountered in real-world problems. The known methods of approximation for solving these problems use the idea of stochastic gradient and certain rules of changing the step length for ensuring convergence. In this article, satellite image coregistration problem is chosen for comparing the performance of two important stochastic optimizers like adaptive stochastic gradient descent and simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation. Coregistration datasets from Resource-sat-2 LISS-4 MX sensor are chosen for different terrains and features to study subpixel accuracies of order better than 1/20th of a pixel achieved in the comparison of two different optimization techniques employed in intensity-based automatic image registration framework.},

  abstract = {Statistical downscaling methods are popular post-processing tools which are widely used in many sectors to adapt the coarse-resolution biased outputs from global climate simulations to the regional-to-local scale typically required by users. They range from simple and pragmatic Bias Correction (BC) methods, which directly adjust the model outputs of interest (e.g. precipitation) according to the available local observations, to more complex Perfect Prognosis (PP) ones, which indirectly derive local predictions (e.g. precipitation) from appropriate upper-air large-scale model variables (predictors). Statistical downscaling methods have been extensively used and critically assessed in climate change applications; however, their advantages and limitations in seasonal forecasting are not well understood yet. In particular, a key problem in this context is whether they serve to improve the forecast quality/skill of raw model outputs beyond the adjustment of their systematic biases. In this paper we analyze this issue by applying two state-of-the-art BC and two PP methods to downscale precipitation from a multimodel seasonal hindcast in a challenging tropical region, the Philippines. To properly assess the potential added value beyond the reduction of model biases, we consider two validation scores which are not sensitive to changes in the mean (correlation and reliability categories). Our results show that, whereas BC methods maintain or worsen the skill of the raw model forecasts, PP methods can yield significant skill improvement (worsening) in cases for which the large-scale predictor variables considered are better (worse) predicted by the model than precipitation. For instance, PP methods are found to increase (decrease) model reliability in nearly 40\% of the stations considered in boreal~summer (autumn). Therefore, the choice of a convenient downscaling approach (either BC or PP) depends on the region and the season.},

To be as critical as possible, we validate the raw model and the calibrated forecasts in terms of a number of metrics which take into account different aspects of forecast quality (association, accuracy, discrimination and reliability). We focus on one-month lead forecasts of precipitation and temperature from four state-of-the-art seasonal forecasting systems, three of them included in the Copernicus Climate Change Service dataset (ECMWF-SEAS5, UK Met Office-GloSea5 and M{\'e}t{\'e}o France-System5) for boreal winter and summer over two illustrative regions with different skill characteristics (Europe and Southeast Asia). Our results indicate that both BA and RC methods effectively correct the large raw model biases, which is of paramount importance for users, particularly when directly using the climate model outputs to run impact models, or when computing climate indices depending on absolute values/thresholds. However, except for particular regions and/or seasons (typically with high skill), there is only marginal added value{\textemdash}with respect to the raw model outputs{\textemdash}beyond this bias removal. For those cases, RC methods can outperform BA ones, mostly due to an improvement in reliability. Finally, we also show that whereas an increase in the number of members only modestly affects the results obtained from calibration, longer hindcast periods lead to improved forecast quality, particularly for RC methods.},

(Clim Dyn 53(3{\textendash}4):1287{\textendash}1305, 2019) which provides a comprehensive intercomparison of alternatives for the post-processing (statistical adjustment, calibration and downscaling) of seasonal forecasts for a particularly interesting region, Southeast Asia. To answer the questions that were raised in the preceding work, apart from Bias Adjustment (BA) and ensemble Re-Calibration (RC) methods{\textemdash}which transform directly the variable of interest,{\textemdash}we include here more complex Perfect Prognosis (PP) and Model Outputs Statistics (MOS) downscaling techniques{\textemdash}which operate on a selection of large-scale model circulation variables linked to the local observed variable of interest. Moreover, we test the suitability of BA and PP methods for the post-processing of daily{\textemdash}not only seasonal{\textemdash}time-series, which are often needed in a variety of sectoral applications (crop, hydrology, etc.) or to compute specific climate indices (heat waves, fire weather index, etc.). In addition, we also undertake an assessment of the effect that observational uncertainty may have for statistical post-processing. Our results indicate that PP methods (and to a lesser extent MOS) are highly case-dependent and their application must be carefully analyzed for the region/season/application of interest, since they can either improve or degrade the raw model outputs. Therefore, for those cases for which the use of these methods cannot be carefully tested by experts, our overall recommendation would be the use of BA methods, which seem to be a safe, easy to implement alternative that provide competitive results in most situations. Nevertheless, all methods (including BA ones) seem to be sensitive to observational uncertainty, especially regarding the reproduction of extremes and spells. For MOS and PP methods, this issue can even lead to important regional differences in interannual skill. The lessons learnt from this work can substantially benefit a wide range of end-users in different socio-economic sectors, and can also have important implications for the development of high-quality climate services.},

If the observations are of similar resolution as the regional climate model, quantile mapping is a feasible approach. However, if the observations are of much higher resolution, quantile mapping also attempts to bridge this scale mismatch. Here, it is shown for daily precipitation that such quantile mapping{\textendash}based downscaling is not feasible but introduces similar problems as inflation of perfect prognosis (``prog'') downscaling: the spatial and temporal structure of the corrected time series is misrepresented, the drizzle effect for area means is overcorrected, area-mean extremes are overestimated, and trends are affected. To overcome these problems, stochastic bias correction is required.},

Whereas impact models typically require high resolution unbiased input data, global and regional climate models are in general biased, their resolution is often lower than desired. Thus, many users of climate model data apply some form of bias correction and downscaling. A fundamental assumption of bias correction is that the considered climate model produces skillful input for a bias correction, including a plausible representation of climate change. Current bias correction methods cannot plausibly correct climate change trends, and have limited ability to downscale. Cross validation of marginal aspects is not sufficient to evaluate bias correction and needs to be complemented by further analyses. Future research should address the development of stochastic models for downscaling and approaches to explicitly incorporate process understanding.},

In this paper, we present the key ingredients of this framework. VALUE's main approach to validation is user- focused: starting from a specific user problem, a validation tree guides the selection of relevant validation indices and performance measures. Several experiments have been designed to isolate specific points in the downscaling procedure where problems may occur: what is the isolated downscaling skill? How do statistical and dynamical methods compare? How do methods perform at different spatial scales? Do methods fail in representing regional climate change? How is the overall representation of regional climate, including errors inherited from global climate models? The framework will be the basis for a comprehensive community-open downscaling intercomparison study, but is intended also to provide general guidance for other validation studies.},

Model output statistics performs mostly well, but requires predictors at a resolution close to the target one. Perfect prog performance depends crucially on model structure and predictor choice. Weather generators perform in principle well for all aspects that can be expressed by the available model structure. Inter-annual variability is underrepresented by both perfect prog and weather generator approaches. Spatial variability is poorly represented by almost all participating methods (inherited by model output statistics from the driving model, not represented by the perfect prog and weather generator methods). Further studies are required to systematically assess (a) the role of predictor choice for perfect prog; (b) the performance of spatial weather generators, to study the performance based on GCM predictors; (c) downscaling skill in simulated future climates; and (d) the credibility of simulated predictors in a future climate.},

The newly proposed approach consists of a particle batch smoother (PBS), which is compared to a previously applied Kalman-based ensemble batch smoother (EnBS) approach. The methods were applied over the 27-yr Landsat 5 record at snow pillow and snow course in situ verification sites in the American River basin in the Sierra Nevada (United States). This basin is more densely vegetated and thus more challenging for SWE estimation than the previous applications of the EnBS. Both data assimilation methods provided significant improvement over the prior (modeling only) estimates, with both able to significantly reduce prior SWE biases. The prior RMSE values at the snow pillow and snow course sites were reduced by 68\%{\textendash}82\% and 60\%{\textendash}68\%, respectively, when applying the data assimilation methods. This result is encouraging for a basin like the American where the moderate to high forest cover will necessarily obscure more of the snow-covered ground surface than in previously examined, less-vegetated basins. The PBS generally outperformed the EnBS: for snow pillows the PBS RMSE was {\textasciitilde}54\% of that seen in the EnBS, while for snow courses the PBS RMSE was {\textasciitilde}79\% of the EnBS. Sensitivity tests show relative insensitivity for both the PBS and EnBS results to ensemble size and fSCA measurement error, but a higher sensitivity for the EnBS to the mean prior precipitation input, especially in the case where significant prior biases exist.},

  author = {Marr, Philipp},
  year = {2019},
  abstract = {Abstract The investigation of periglacial and related landforms in South Norway is of high interest for exploring timings of deglaciation and to assess their geomorphological connectivity to palaeoclimatic changes during the Late Quaternary and the Holocene. The ice margins of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) are fairly well known, the palaeo-ice thickness, however, which can only be estimated by modelling, remains unclear over large parts of Norway owing to rare field based evidences. Due to the significant influence of the former horizontal and vertical ice-sheet extent on sea-level rise, atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns, erosive properties of glaciers and ice sheets, englacial thermal boundaries and deglaciation dynamics, it is crucial to better understand the topographic features of the LGM ice sheet. Despite recent advances, there is a lack of terrestrial evidences from numerical data in South Norway. In this thesis two high-mountain regions and their surroundings in west (Dalsnibba, 1476 m a.s.l.) and east (Bl{\aa}h{\o}, 1617 m a.s.l.) South Norway were used to reconstruct palaeoclimatic conditions and deglaciation patterns. Terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides (10Be) and Schmidt-hammer exposure-age dating (SHD) have been utilized to determine the surface exposure of glacially transported boulders as well as of boulderdominated glacial, periglacial and paraglacial landforms and bedrock outcrops. By developing calibration curves at both study sites for the first time, through young and old control points of known age, it was possible to obtain landform age estimates from Schmidt hammer R-(rebound) values. Beside age estimates, the formation and stabilization of those landforms and the involved processes have provided indications about the Late Quaternary and Holocene climate variability and its connectivity to landform development.},

Among them, model output statistics (MOS) and perfect prog have been most common, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Here, an alternative method (called RAN) is examined that combines the two, while at the same time utilizes the information in reanalysis data. The three methods are examined from a purely formal/mathematical point of view. The results suggest that whereas MOS is expected to outperform perfect prog and RAN in terms of mean squared error, bias, and error variance, the RAN approach is expected to yield more certain and bias-free forecasts. It is suggested therefore that a real-time RAN-based postprocessor be developed for further testing.},

We used unblended field records to simulate heavily blended data up to 8 Hz with a maximum offset of 30 km. Our inversion-based deblending method involves many iterations of separating the most coherent hyperboloidal events in a cube of data formed by all traces recorded in a single node. Coherent hyperboloidal components are modeled by using an amplitude threshold in the 3D f-k domain, while various temporal shifts are applied. The leakage of blending noise into the estimated model is then reduced by using further coherency enhancement algorithms during the inversion process. This study shows that it is possible to reveal the signals required for an FWI workflow.},

  abstract = {The European Alps stretch over a range of climate zones which affect the spatial distribution of snow. Previous analyses of station observations of snow were confined to regional analyses. Here, we present an Alpine-wide analysis of snow depth from six Alpine countries {\textendash} Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Slovenia, and Switzerland {\textendash} including altogether more than 2000 stations of which more than 800 were used for the trend assessment. Using a principal component analysis and k-means clustering, we identified five main modes of variability and five regions which match the climatic forcing zones: north and high Alpine, north-east, north-west, south-east, and south and high Alpine. Linear trends of monthly mean snow depth between 1971 and 2019 showed decreases in snow depth for most stations from November to May. The average trend among all stations for seasonal (November to May) mean snow depth was -8.4 \% per decade, for seasonal maximum snow depth -5.6 \% per decade, and for seasonal snow cover duration -5.6 \% per decade. Stronger and more significant trends were observed for periods and elevations where the transition from snow to snow-free occurs, which is consistent with an enhanced albedo feedback. Additionally, regional trends differed substantially at the same elevation, which challenges the notion of generalizing results from one region to another or to the whole Alps. This study presents an analysis of station snow depth series with the most comprehensive spatial coverage in the European Alps to date.},

  abstract = {Three relict talus-foot rock glaciers at {\O}yberget, upper Ottadalen, were dated using high-precision Schmidt hammer exposure-age dating (SHD). A SHD calibration curve was constructed for the local banded gneiss using two control points: (1) fresh bedrock in a road cutting; and (2) glacially scoured bedrock surfaces deglaciated c. 9.7 ka. Two alternative hypotheses are suggested to explain SHD ages ({$\pm$} 95\% confidence intervals) of 10 340 {$\pm$} 1280, 9920 {$\pm$} 1385 and 8965 {$\pm$} 1700 years obtained for the three rock glaciers located 1000 m below the present lower limit of mountain permafrost, at a site covered by glacier ice throughout the Late Weichselian. First, the rock glaciers may be paraglacial features, which formed rapidly during deglaciation when enhanced debris supply may have buried residual ice bodies. If this was the case, the SHD ages are a true reflection of rock glacier age. Second, the rock glaciers may have formed during several thousand years of permafrost conditions in the Mid-Weichselian (possibly during the {\AA}lesund Interstadial, c. 34.5{\textendash}38.2 ka) and then been preserved beneath a cold-based ice sheet until renewed exposure during Holocene deglaciation. If the second hypothesis is true, then the true age of the rock glaciers is much older than their SHD ages, the latter failing to record the interval of burial when rock weathering would have been zero. Although evidence is currently insufficient to distinguish between these two interpretations, the paper demonstrates both the potential and limitations of high-precision SHD in the context of rock glaciers.

  abstract = {Organisms possess many mechanisms for protecting themselves from pathogens. In addition to the well-studied innate and adaptive immune systems of vertebrates, recently discovered mechanisms such as CRISPR immunity in prokaryotes diversify the known modes of information processing used in immune protection. By classifying these different systems in terms of their rules of heritability and response to the environment, we propose a mathematical framework that recapitulates the observed natural diversity of immune systems. We show how the basic modes of immunity emerge as optimal strategies of a population adapting to a changing pathogenic environment. The proposed framework offers a unified view of immunity across species and helps rationalize the diversity of observed mechanisms., Biological organisms have evolved a wide range of immune mechanisms to defend themselves against pathogens. Beyond molecular details, these mechanisms differ in how protection is acquired, processed, and passed on to subsequent generations{\textemdash}differences that may be essential to long-term survival. Here, we introduce a mathematical framework to compare the long-term adaptation of populations as a function of the pathogen dynamics that they experience and of the immune strategy that they adopt. We find that the two key determinants of an optimal immune strategy are the frequency and the characteristic timescale of the pathogens. Depending on these two parameters, our framework identifies distinct modes of immunity, including adaptive, innate, bet-hedging, and CRISPR-like immunities, which recapitulate the diversity of natural immune systems.},

  abstract = {The rapid uptake of renewable energy technologies in recent decades has increased the demand of energy researchers, policymakers and energy planners for reliable data on the spatial distribution of their costs and potentials. For onshore wind energy this has resulted in an active research field devoted to analysing these resources for regions, countries or globally. A particular thread of this research attempts to go beyond purely technical or spatial restrictions and determine the realistic, feasible or actual potential for wind energy. Motivated by these developments, this paper reviews methods and assumptions for analysing geographical, technical, economic and, finally, feasible onshore wind potentials. We address each of these potentials in turn, including aspects related to land eligibility criteria, energy meteorology, and technical developments of wind turbine characteristics such as power density, specific rotor power and spacing aspects. Economic aspects of potential assessments are central to future deployment and are discussed on a turbine and system level covering levelized costs depending on locations, and the system integration costs which are often overlooked in such analyses. Non-technical approaches include scenicness assessments of the landscape, constraints due to regulation or public opposition, expert and stakeholder workshops, willingness to pay/accept elicitations and socioeconomic cost-benefit studies. For each of these different potential estimations, the state of the art is critically discussed, with an attempt to derive best practice recommendations and highlight avenues for future research.},

  abstract = {Glacier mass balance has been estimated on individual glacier and regional scales using repeat digital elevation models (DEMs). DEMs often have gaps in coverage (``voids''), the properties of which depend on the nature of the sensor used and the surface being measured. The way that these voids are accounted for has a direct impact on the estimate of geodetic glacier mass balance, though a systematic comparison of different proposed methods has been heretofore lacking. In this study, we determine the impact and sensitivity of void interpolation methods on estimates of volume change. Using two spatially complete, high-resolution DEMs over southeast Alaska, USA, we artificially generate voids in one of the DEMs using correlation values derived from photogrammetric processing of Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) scenes. We then compare 11 different void interpolation methods on a glacier-by-glacier and regional basis. We find that a few methods introduce biases of up to 20 \% in the regional results, while other methods give results very close ( {$<$} 1 \% difference) to the true, non-voided volume change estimates. By comparing results from a few of the best-performing methods, an estimate of the uncertainty introduced by interpolating voids can be obtained. Finally, by increasing the number of voids, we show that with these best-performing methods, reliable estimates of glacier-wide volume change can be obtained, even with sparse DEM coverage.},

As a result, subsalt imaging has been approaching a plateau in the last few years, largely because of our inability to improve the accuracy of salt models. Fast forward to today, where the recent success of using fullwaveform inversion (FWI) to automatically update salt models and significantly improve subsalt images has opened the door to a new era of subsalt imaging. As FWI for salt model updates prefers data with good low frequencies, long offsets, and full azimuth, sparse nodes for velocity surveys were proposed to serve as an economic yet suitable acquisition solution for large-scale subsalt exploration. Because of FWI's prior inability to update salt models for field data, the feasibility of sparse nodes for velocity surveys was previously only studied on synthetic data, from which the conclusions might not be immediately applicable to field data. Using a recently-developed FWI algorithm that proves to work on salt in field data, and by decimating the densely-acquired Atlantis ocean bottom node (OBN) data, we studied the impact of sparse node data for FWI salt model updates. Based on the understanding gained from this, we further proposed and validated methods to improve FWI results with sparse nodes for velocity data.},

Conditional quantiles can be inferred with quantile regression forests, a generalisation of random forests.

A machine learning method using topographic parameters with the Random Forest (RF) algorithm previously developed in alpine environments was applied over an arctic landscape for the first time. The topographic parameters used in the RF algorithm were Topographic Position Index (TPI) and up-wind slope index (Sx), which were estimated from the freely available Arctic DEM at 2 m resolution. Addition of an ecotype parameter (proxy for vegetation height) showed minimal predictive improvement. Using RF, snow depth distributions were predicted from topographic parameters with a root mean square error = 8 cm (23\%) (R2 = 0.79) at 10 m resolution for an arctic watershed (1500 km2) in western Nunavut, Canada.},

The measured values at 1 km2 were compared with simulated snow depth from the seNorge snow model (www.senorge.no), which is run on a 1 km2 grid resolution. Results show that the spatial variability decreases as the scale increases. At a scale of about 500 m2 to 1 km2 the variability of snow depth is somewhat larger than that modeled by seNorge. This analysis shows that (1) the regional-scale spatial pattern of snow distribution is well captured by the seNorge model and (2) relatively large differences in snow depth between the measured and modeled values are present.},

Specifically, we analyze snow depth maps acquired near the date of maximum accumulation in 2018 at three experimental sites: (i) the Tascadero catchment (-31.26{$^\circ$}N, 3270-3790 m), (ii) the Las Bayas catchment (-33.31{$^\circ$}N, 3218-4022 m); and (iii) the Valle Hermoso (VH) catchment (-36.91{$^\circ$}N, 1449-2563 m). We examine two subdomains in the latter site: one with (VH West) and one without (VH East) shrub cover. The comparison across sites reveals that elevational gradients are site-dependent, and that the gamma and normal distributions are more robust than the lognormal function to characterize the spatial variability of snow depth. Multiscale behavior in snow depth is obtained in all sites, with up to three fractal regimes, and the magnitude of primary scale breaks is found to be related to the mean separation distance between local snow depth peaks. The differences in snow depth fractal parameters between VH West - the only vegetated subdomain - and the remaining sites suggest that local topographic and land cover properties are dominant controls on the spatial structure of snow, rather than average hydroclimatic conditions. Overall, the results presented here provide, for the first time, insights into the spatial structure of snow depth along the extratropical Andes Cordillera, showing notable similarities with other mountain regions in the Northern Hemisphere and providing guidance for future snow studies.},

  abstract = {Understanding and characterizing the spatial distribution of snow are critical to represent the energy balance and runoff production in mountain environments. In this study, we investigate the interannual and seasonal variability in snow depth scaling behavior at the Izas experimental catchment of the Spanish Pyrenees (2,000 to 2,300 m above sea level). We conduct variogram analyses of 24 snow depth maps derived from terrestrial light detection and ranging scans, acquired during six consecutive snow seasons (2011{\textendash}2017) that span a range of hydroclimatic conditions. We complement our analyses with bare ground topography data and wind speed and direction measurements. Our results show temporal consistency in the spatial variability of snow depth, with short-range fractal behavior and scale break lengths that are similar to the optimal search distance (25 m) previously reported for the topographic position index, a terrain-based predictor of snow depth. Beyond the 25-m scale break, there is little to no fractal structure. We report a long-range scale break of the order of 185{\textendash}300 m for most dates{\textemdash}aligned with the dominant wind direction{\textemdash}and patterns between anisotropies in scale break lengths of shallow snow cover and directional terrain scaling behavior. The temporal consistency of snow depth scaling patterns suggests that, in addition to guiding the spatial configuration of physically based models, fractal analysis could be used to inform the design of independent variables for statistical models used to predict snow depth and its variability.},

  abstract = {The primary aim of single-image super-resolution is to construct high-resolution (HR) images from corresponding low-resolution (LR) inputs. In previous approaches, which have generally been supervised, the training objective typically measures a pixel-wise average distance between the super-resolved (SR) and HR images. Optimizing such metrics often leads to blurring, especially in high variance (detailed) regions. We propose an alternative formulation of the super-resolution problem based on creating realistic SR images that downscale correctly. We present an algorithm addressing this problem, PULSE (Photo Upsampling via Latent Space Exploration), which generates high-resolution, realistic images at resolutions previously unseen in the literature. It accomplishes this in an entirely self-supervised fashion and is not confined to a specific degradation operator used during training, unlike previous methods (which require supervised training on databases of LR-HR image pairs). Instead of starting with the LR image and slowly adding detail, PULSE traverses the high-resolution natural image manifold, searching for images that downscale to the original LR image. This is formalized through the "downscaling loss," which guides exploration through the latent space of a generative model. By leveraging properties of high-dimensional Gaussians, we restrict the search space to guarantee realistic outputs. PULSE thereby generates super-resolved images that both are realistic and downscale correctly. We show proof of concept of our approach in the domain of face super-resolution (i.e., face hallucination). We also present a discussion of the limitations and biases of the method as currently implemented with an accompanying model card with relevant metrics. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in perceptual quality at higher resolutions and scale factors than previously possible.},

The types are long-rain floods, short-rain floods, flash floods, rain-on-snow floods, and snowmelt floods. We adopt a catchment perspective, i.e., the focus is on the catchment state and the atmospheric inputs rather than on atmospheric circulation patterns. We use a combination of a number of process indicators, including the timing of the floods, storm duration, rainfall depths, snowmelt, catchment state, runoff response dynamics, and spatial coherence. On the basis of these indicators and diagnostic regional plots we identify the process types of 11,518 maximum annual flood peaks in 490 Austrian catchments. Forty-three percent of the flood peaks are long-rain floods, only 3\% are snowmelt floods, and the relative contribution of the types changes with the flood magnitude. There are pronounced spatial patterns in the frequency of flood type occurrence. For example, rain-on-snow floods most commonly occur in northern Austria. Runoff coefficients tend to increase with rainfall depth for long-rain floods but are less dependent of rainfall depth and exhibit much larger scatter for flash floods. All types exhibit seasonal patterns, both in terms of flood magnitudes and catchment altitudes of flood occurrence. The coefficient of variation (CV) of the flood samples stratified by process type decreases with catchment area for most process types with the exception of flash floods for which CV increases with catchment area.},

In the references analysed, except in rare cases where an accuracy assessment standard has been followed, accuracy criteria and methods are usually established according to the premises established by the authors. Visual analyses and 3D analyses are few in number. The great majority of cases assess accuracy by means of point-type control elements, with the use of linear and surface elements very rare. Most cases still consider the normal model for errors (discrepancies), but analysis based on the data itself is making headway. Sample size and clear criteria for segmentation are still open issues. Almost 21\% of cases analyse the accuracy in some derived parameter(s) or output, but no standardization exists for this purpose. Thus, there has been an improvement in accuracy assessment methods, but there are still many aspects that require the attention of researchers and professional associations or standardization bodies such as a common vocabulary, standardized assessment methods, methods for meta-quality assessment, and indices with an applied quality perspective, among others.},

First, our PDM is compared to a reference method (Quantile-matching), and validated on a historical time period by downscaling CDFs of wind intensity anomalies over France, for reanalyses and simulations from a general circulation model (GCM). Then, CDF-transform is applied to GCM output fields to project changes in wind intensity anomalies for the 21st century under A2 scenario. Results show a decrease in wind anomalies for most weather stations, ranging from less than 1\% (in the South) to nearly 9\% (in the North), with a maximum in the Brittany region.},

  abstract = {Dynamic natural processes govern snow distribution in mountainous environments throughout the world. Interactions between these different processes create spatially variable patterns of snow depth across a landscape. Variations in accumulation and redistribution occur at a variety of spatial scales, which are well established for moderate mountain terrain. However, spatial patterns of snow depth variability in steep, complex mountain terrain have not been fully explored due to insufficient spatial resolutions of snow depth measurement. Recent advances in uncrewed aerial systems (UASs) and structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry provide an opportunity to map spatially continuous snow depths at high resolutions in these environments. Using UASs and SfM photogrammetry, we produced 11 snow depth maps at a steep couloir site in the Bridger Range of Montana, USA, during the 2019{\textendash}2020 winter. We quantified the spatial scales of snow depth variability in this complex mountain terrain at a variety of resolutions over 2 orders of magnitude (0.02 to 20 m) and time steps (4 to 58 d) using variogram analysis in a high-performance computing environment. We found that spatial resolutions greater than 0.5 m do not capture the complete patterns of snow depth spatial variability within complex mountain terrain and that snow depths are autocorrelated within horizontal distances of 15 m at our study site. The results of this research have the potential to reduce uncertainty currently associated with snowpack and snow water resource analysis by documenting and quantifying snow depth variability and snowpack evolution on relatively inaccessible slopes in complex terrain at high spatial and temporal resolutions.},

Glacial erosion linked to long-term spatial gradients in the ELA created a tilted, planar zone of 373 cirques across the central part of the range; peaks and ridges now rise {$\leq$}600 m above this zone. Hypsometric analysis of the region shows that the proportion of land area above the cirques drops sharply, and mean slopes {$>$}30               {$^\circ$}               indicate that the areas above the cirques may be at or near threshold steepness. The mean plus 1{$\sigma$} relief of individual cirque basins (570 m) corresponds to the {$\sim$}600-m envelope above which peaks rarely rise. The summit altitudes are set by a combination of higher rates of glacial and paraglacial erosion above the ELA and enhanced hillslope processes due to the creation of steep topography. On the high-precipitation western flank of the Cascades, the dominance of glacial and hillslope erosion at altitudes at and above the ELA may explain the lack of a correspondence between stream-power erosion models and measured exhumation rates from apatite (U-Th/He) thermochronometry.},

This concept of a "sequence" is modified from Sloss. A depositional sequence is determined by a single objective criterion, the physical relations of the strata themselves. The combination of objective determination of sequence boundaries and the systematic patterns of deposition of the genetically related strata within sequences makes the sequence concept a fundamental and extremely practical basis for the interpretation of stratigraphy and depositional facies. Because distribution and facies of many sequences are controlled by global changes of sea level, sequences also provide an ideal basis for establishing comprehensive stratigraphic frameworks on regional or global scales. A depositional sequence is chronostratigraphically significant because it was deposited during a given interval of geologic time limited by ages of the sequence boundaries where the boundaries are conformities; however the age range of the strata within the sequence may differ from place to place where the boundaries are unconformities. The hiatus along the unconformable part of a sequence boundary generally is variable in duration. The hiatus along the conformable part is not measureable, and the surface is practically synchronous. Stratal surfaces within a sequence are essentially synchronous in terms of geologic time. Depositional sequences may range in thickness from hundreds of meters to a few centimeters. Sequences of different magnitudes may be recognized on seismic sections, well-log sections, and surface outcrops.},

This study is concentrated on the estimation of extreme snow depth and ground snow load and on snow hazard mapping in China by using historical snow measurement data. A probabilistic model of the snowpack bulk density was developed. For the extreme value analysis of annual maximum snow depth, both the at-site analysis and region of influence approach were applied. Also, several commonly used probabilistic models and distribution fitting methods were considered for the extreme value analysis. For the annual maximum snow depth, it was identified from the at-site analysis results that the number of sites where the lognormal distribution is preferred is greater than that where the Gumbel distribution is preferred. The 50-year return period value obtained from the ROI approach is insensitive to whether the three-parameter lognormal distribution or the generalized extreme value distribution is adopted. Maps of annual maximum snow depth and ground snow load were developed. Comparison of the estimated ground snow load to that recommended in the design code was presented, and potential updating to the ground snow load in the design code was suggested.},

I have examined the shape of the Fresnel zone for nonzero offset and in the situation of constant velocity gradient. Finite-offset Fresnel zones are not circular but are elliptical and may be many times larger than their zero-offset equivalents. My derivation takes a largely geometric approach, and I suggest a useful approximation for the dimension of the Fresnel zone parallel to the shot-receiver azimuth. The presence of a velocity gradient Õëvelocity increasing with depthÕí in the subsurface leads to an expansion of the Fresnel zone to an area that is far larger than may be determined through a more usual straight-ray determination.},

  abstract = {Beasley et al. (2016) introduced the notion of the robust inner product (RIP) wherein the standard inner product is modified by first forming the sequence of product elements and then identifying, removing and replacing outliers in the sequence before summing. Further, we used RIPs to replace standard linear algebra operations such as matrix multiplication with their robust equivalents and call this robust linear algebra (RLA). We illustrated the effectiveness of this approach in dealing with the strong-on-weak and coarse shot spacing problems in separating simultaneous source field data by implementing it in our sparse-inversion approach to simultaneous source separation. In this paper, we present data studies that illustrate the inner workings of the RIP in simultaneous source separation. We show that amplitude imbalances between sources due to widely different reflection times result in two separate and important effects. We show that the sparsity constraint is affected by amplitude imbalances and causes incorrect choices of basis functions to represent the data. Then we show that, even if the optimal basis functions are chosen, the solution portion of the problem is also affected. We find that these issues are both mitigated by employing RIPs and RLA.},

  abstract = {Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is an advanced seismic imaging technique that has recently become computationally feasible in three dimensions, and that is being widely adopted and applied by the oil and gas industry. Here we explore the potential for 3-D FWI, when combined with appropriate marine seismic acquisition, to recover high-resolution high-fidelity P-wave velocity models for subsedimentary targets within the crystalline crust and uppermost mantle. We demonstrate that FWI is able to recover detailed 3-D structural information within a radially faulted dome using a field data set acquired with a standard 3-D petroleum-industry marine acquisition system. Acquiring low-frequency seismic data is important for successful FWI; we show that current acquisition techniques can routinely acquire field data from airguns at frequencies as low as 2 Hz, and that 1 Hz acquisition is likely to be achievable using oceanbottom hydrophones in deep water. Using existing geological and geophysical models, we construct P-wave velocity models over three potential subsedimentary targets: the Soufrie`re Hills Volcano on Montserrat and its associated crustal magmatic system, the crust and uppermost mantle across the continent{\textendash}ocean transition beneath the Campos Basin offshore Brazil, and the oceanic crust and uppermost mantle beneath the East Pacific Rise mid-ocean ridge. We use these models to generate realistic multi-azimuth 3-D synthetic seismic data, and attempt to invert these data to recover the original models. We explore resolution and accuracy, sensitivity to noise and acquisition geometry, ability to invert elastic data using acoustic inversion codes, and the trade-off between low frequencies and starting velocity model accuracy. We show that FWI applied to multi-azimuth, refracted, wide-angle, low-frequency data can resolve features in the deep crust and uppermost mantle on scales that are significantly better than can be achieved by any other geophysical technique, and that these results can be obtained using relatively small numbers (60{\textendash}90) of ocean-bottom receivers combined with large numbers of airgun shots. We demonstrate that multi-azimuth 3-D FWI is robust in the presence of noise, that acoustic FWI can invert elastic data successfully, and that the typical errors to be expected in starting models derived using traveltimes will not be problematic for FWI given appropriately designed acquisition. FWI is a rapidly maturing technology; its transfer from the petroleum sector to tackle a much broader range of targets now appears to be entirely achievable.},

The topography of the Arctic is more poorly mapped than most other regions of Earth due to logistical costs and the limits of satellite missions with low-latitude inclinations. A convergence of civilian, high-quality sub-meter stereo imagery; petascale computing and open source photogrammetry software has made it possible to produce a complete, very high resolution (2 to 8-meter posting), elevation model of the Arctic. A partnership between the US National Geospatial-intelligence Agency and a team led by the US National Science Foundation funded Polar Geospatial Center is using stereo imagery from DigitalGlobe's Worldview-1, 2 and 3 satellites and the Ohio State University's Surface Extraction with TIN-based Search-space Minimization (SETSM) software running on the University of Illinois's Blue Water supercomputer to address this challenge. The final product will be a seemless, 2-m posting digital surface model mosaic of the entire Arctic above 60 North including all of Alaska, Greenland and Kamchatka. We will also make available the more than 300,000 individual time-stamped DSM strip pairs that were used to assemble the mosaic. The Arctic DEM will have a vertical precision of better than 0.5m and can be used to examine changes in land surfaces such as those caused by permafrost degradation or the evolution of arctic rivers and floodplains. The data set can also be used to highlight changing geomorphology due to Earth surface mass transport processes occurring in active volcanic and glacial environments. When complete the ArcticDEM will catapult the Arctic from the worst to among the best mapped regions on Earth.},

  abstract = {In western North America, many communities rely on runoff from mountain snowpacks. Projections of how future climate change will affect the seasonal snowpack are thus of interest to water managers, communities and policy makers. We investigate projected changes in seasonal snow cover for the twenty-first century for the Canadian portion of the Columbia River Basin using a physically based snow distribution model (SnowModel) at 500~m horizontal resolution. Forcing data for the reference (1979{\textendash}1994) and future (2045{\textendash}2059, 2085{\textendash}2099) periods originate from a 4-member initial condition ensemble of global Community Earth System Model (CESM1) simulations based on the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario. The ensemble was dynamically downscaled (DD) to 10~km resolution using the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF). We also evaluate the performance of SnowModel using publicly available, statistically downscaled (SD) temperature and precipitation. We project a 38\%/28\% and 30\%/15\% decrease in WRF/SD-simulated snow depth and SWE, respectively, by the end of this century relative to the reference period over the entire domain. Our results indicate that the projected loss of snowpack depends largely on elevation and season. Snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) are most affected for elevations below 2000~m asl, with a reduction of more than 60\%. While both simulations show SWE losses in most areas by the end of the century, a stronger projected thinning of the snowpack occurs for the DD-forced simulations compared to the SD-forced simulations.},

The directions of the strongest autocorrelations of snow depths and wind velocities were predominantly perpendicular to the modeled local flow direction, independent of whether more homogeneous lee slope loading in one area was considered or the formation of drifts in another area. In the case of homogeneous lee slope loading, the same direction of anisotropy was only found in the modeled preferential deposition of precipitation as for both wind and snow distribution. This deposition process appears to dominate homogeneous lee slope loading. In contrast, saltation-driven processes seem to dominate the formation of drifts and snow dunes. Furthermore, the fractal analysis suggests similar scale breaks for the modeled wind velocity field and measured snow depths defining the upper scale of landscape smoothing through snow.},

  abstract = {The temporal evolution of seasonal snow cover and its spatial variability in environments such as mountains, prairies or polar regions is strongly influenced by the interactions between the atmospheric boundary layer and the snow cover. Wind-driven coupling processes affect both mass and energy fluxes at the snow surface with consequences on snow hydrology, avalanche hazard, and ecosystem development. This paper proposes a review on these processes and combines the more recent findings obtained from observations and modeling. The spatial variability of snow accumulation across multiple scales can be associated to wind-driven processes ranging from orographic precipitation at large scale to preferential-deposition of snowfall and wind-induced transport of snow on the ground at smaller scales. An overview of models of varying complexity developed to simulate these processes is proposed in this paper. Snow ablation is also affected by wind-driven processes. Over continuous snow covers, turbulent fluxes of latent and sensible heat, as well as blowing snow sublimation, modify the mass, and energy balance of the snowpack and their representation in numerical models is associated with many uncertainties. As soon as the snow cover becomes patchy in spring local heat advection induces the development of stable internal boundary layers changing heat exchange toward the snow. Overall, wind-driven processes play a key role in all the different stages of the evolution of seasonal snow. Improvements in process understanding particularly at the mountain-ridge and the slope scale, and processes representations in models at scales up to the mountain range scale, will be the basis for improved short-term forecast and climate projections in snow-covered regions.},

However, the usability of these flags has not been sufficiently studied to date. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of atmospheric scattering, the presence of snow, canopy cover, terrain slope, beam strength, and solar angle on the accuracy of terrain and canopy height of the ATL08 product as well as on providing recommendations on how to filter data in order to minimize errors. We evaluated the vertical accuracy of ATL08 terrain and canopy height in European mountains by comparing them with the digital terrain model and canopy height model derived from airborne laser scanning data. Our results indicate that the assessment of atmospheric effects using the cloud confidence flag (cloud\_flag\_atm; i.e. number of cloud layers) is better than the previously used multiple scattering warning flag (msw\_flag). Day acquisitions with more than one layer of clouds yielded a terrain elevation RMSE of 3.22~m in forests while night acquisitions with no more than a single layer of clouds resulted in RMSE of 1.73~m. The increasing atmospheric scattering effects increased the photons' path length, resulting in terrain height underestimation. The presence of snow had a strong positive effect on the number of identified ground photons, independently of the canopy cover, but resulted in an overestimation of terrain height in higher altitudes. Accordingly, the presence of snow cover resulted in a significant underestimation of canopy height in forests. The canopy height in broadleaf/mixed as well as coniferous forests was in summer underestimated on average by 2.1~m (\%ME of -15.3\%) and 1.2~m (\%ME of -8.2\%), respectively; in winter, however, the underestimation increased to 8.5~m (\%ME of -56.8\%) and 5.7~m (\%ME of -38.3\%), respectively. Canopy height estimates had better accuracy for the strong beam (RMSE of 5.09~m; \%RMSE of 35.4\%) than for the weak beam (RMSE of 7.03~m; \%RMSE of 51.3\%). Our results show that the ATL08 terrain height accuracy decreases with uneven distribution of signal photons within individual segments and further deteriorates with increasing terrain slope. Filtering out segments with poor distribution of photons, more than one layer of clouds during the day, and snow cover in high altitudes is the best approach for minimizing the error while maximizing the number of segments left for subsequent analysis.},

While the climatologies of total Northern Hemisphere snow water mass (SWM) vary among the datasets by as much as 50\%, their interannual variability and daily anomalies are comparable, showing moderate to good temporal correlations (between 0.60 and 0.85) on both interannual and intraseasonal time scales. Wintertime trends of total Northern Hemisphere SWM are consistently negative over the 1981{\textendash}2010 period among the five datasets but vary in strength by a factor of 2{\textendash}3. Examining spatial patterns of SWE indicates that the datasets are most consistent with one another over boreal forest regions compared to Arctic and alpine regions. Additionally, the datasets derived using relatively recent reanalyses are strongly correlated with one another and show better correlations with the satellite product [the European Space Agency (ESA)'s Global Snow Monitoring for Climate Research (GlobSnow)] than do those using older reanalyses. Finally, a comparison of eight reanalysis datasets over the 2001{\textendash}10 period shows that land surface model differences control the majority of spread in the climatological value of SWM, while meteorological forcing differences control the majority of the spread in temporal correlations of SWM anomalies.},

An ensemble of six observation-based products is used to produce a new time series of historical Northern Hemisphere snow extent anomalies and trends; a subset of four of these products is used for snow mass. Trends in snow extent over 1981{\textendash}2018 are negative in all months and exceed -50{\texttimes}103\&thinsp;km2 yr-1 during November, December, March, and May. Snow mass trends are approximately -5\&thinsp;Gt yr-1 or more for all months from December to May. Overall, the CMIP6 multi-model ensemble better represents the snow extent climatology over the 1981{\textendash}2014 period for all months, correcting a low bias in CMIP5. Simulated snow extent and snow mass trends over the 1981{\textendash}2014 period are stronger in CMIP6 than in CMIP5, although large inter-model spread remains in the simulated trends for both variables. There is a single linear relationship between projected spring snow extent and global surface air temperature (GSAT) changes, which is valid across all CMIP6 Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. This finding suggests that Northern Hemisphere spring snow extent will decrease by about 8\&thinsp;\% relative to the 1995{\textendash}2014 level per degree Celsius of GSAT increase. The sensitivity of snow to temperature forcing largely explains the absence of any climate change pathway dependency, similar to other fast-response components of the cryosphere such as sea ice and near-surface permafrost extent.},

  abstract = {The Goliat field consists of Middle to Late Triassic reservoirs which exploit an elongate anticline (the Goliat anticline) in the hanging wall of the Troms-Finnmark Fault Complex (TFFC), offshore Norway. The area is affected by a dense network of multiple trending fault populations which historically have inhibited seismic resolution owing to persistent fault shadow. Seismic investigations utilising a multiazimuth three-dimensional survey (EN0901) allow much crisper delineation of seismic features previously unattainable by vintage single-azimuth surveys. Three dominant fault populations are identified in the area, two of which parallel TFFC segments, the AlkeeGoliat (WSWeENE) and the GoliateTornerose (NNEeSSW) segments. The Goliat field is located within a zone of intersection between both segments. A third EeW trending fault population, the Hammerfest Regional population, is likely influenced by the offshore extension of the Trollfjord-Komagelv Fault Complex (TKFZ). A local NWeSE trending fault population, the Goliat Central, affects the Goliat anticline and partitions AlkeeGoliat and Goliat eTornerose subsidiary faults resulting in curvilinear traces. Several cross-cutting relationships between fault populations are observed and may provide fluid compartmentalisation in the reservoirs. Compilation of regional transects and the EN0901 survey provides new insight into the evolution of the Goliat anticline which is underlain by a fault-bound basement terrace that became established in the Late Palaeozoic. The structure is interpreted to have formed due to vertical segmentation of the TFFC and cores the overlying broad anticline. The western limb of the Goliat anticline likely formed by differential compaction, whereas the eastern limb is primarily a result of hanging wall roll-over linked to variable listric to ramp-flat-ramp fault geometry. Rifting took place in the Palaeozoic (Carboniferous to Permian?), and in the Mesozoic, possibly as early as the Late Triassic, with a major event in the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous. Minor reactivations continued into the Late Cretaceous, and possibly the Early Cenozoic. Mesozoic syn-kinematic geometries in the hanging wall of the GoliateTornerose TFFC segment are consistent with deposition during up section propagation of a blind fault, over which, a monocline was established and later breached. Jogs (abrupt orientation changes) in fault traces, transverse folds (associated with displacement maxima/minima) and vertical fault jogs suggest the TFFC existed as a greater number of segments prior to amalgamation during the Late Triassic to Jurassic. A phase of Barremian inversion created local compression structures above blind extensional faults, and deeper seated buttressing against large faults. Polygonal faults affect the Late Cretaceous to Early Cenozoic successions. {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Framed within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) of the European Commission, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is producing an enhanced global dataset for the land component of the fifth generation of European ReAnalysis (ERA5), hereafter referred to as ERA5-Land. Once completed, the period covered will span from 1950 to the present, with continuous updates to support land monitoring applications. ERA5-Land describes the evolution of the water and energy cycles over land in a consistent manner over the production period, which, among others, could be used to analyse trends and anomalies. This is achieved through global high-resolution numerical integrations of the ECMWF land surface model driven by the downscaled meteorological forcing from the ERA5 climate reanalysis, including an elevation correction for the thermodynamic near-surface state. ERA5-Land shares with ERA5 most of the parameterizations that guarantees the use of the state-of-the-art land surface modelling applied to numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. A main advantage of ERA5-Land compared to ERA5 and the older ERA-Interim is the horizontal resolution, which is enhanced globally to 9 km compared to 31 km (ERA5) or 80 km (ERA-Interim), whereas the temporal resolution is hourly as in ERA5. Evaluation against independent in situ observations and global model or satellite-based reference datasets shows the added value of ERA5-Land in the description of the hydrological cycle, in particular with enhanced soil moisture and lake description, and an overall better agreement of river discharge estimations with available observations. However, ERA5-Land snow depth fields present a mixed performance when compared to those of ERA5, depending on geographical location and altitude. The description of the energy cycle shows comparable results with ERA5. Nevertheless, ERA5-Land reduces the global averaged root mean square error of the skin temperature, taking as reference MODIS data, mainly due to the contribution of coastal points where spatial resolution is important. Since January 2020, the ERA5-Land period available has extended from January 1981 to the near present, with a 2- to 3-month delay with respect to real time. The segment prior to 1981 is in production, aiming for a release of the whole dataset in summer/autumn 2021. The high spatial and temporal resolution of ERA5-Land, its extended period, and the consistency of the fields produced makes it a valuable dataset to support hydrological studies, to initialize NWP and climate models, and to support diverse applications dealing with water resource, land, and environmental management.},

The three reanalyses are the ERA5, the New European Wind Atlas (NEWA) and DTU's previous generation European-level atmospheric reanalysis (EIWR). An optional scaling is applied to match the microscale mean wind speeds reported in the Global Wind Atlas version 2 (GWA2). This mean wind speed scaling is used to account for the effects of terrain on the wind speed distributions. The European wind power fleet for 2015{\textendash}2018 is simulated, with commissioning of new wind power plants (WPPs) considered for each year. A generic wake model is implemented to include wake losses that are layout agnostic; the wake model captures the expected wake losses as function of wind speed given the technical characteristics of the WPP. We validate both point measurement wind speeds and generation time-series aggregated at the country-level. Wind measurements from 32 tall meteorological masts are used to validate the wind speed, while power production for four years from twelve European countries is used to validate the simulated country-level power production. Various metrics are used to rank the models according to the variables of interest: descriptive statistics, distributions, daily patterns, auto-correlation and spatial-correlation. We find that NEWA outperforms ERA5 and EIWR for the simulated wind speed, but, as expected, no model is able to fully describe the auto-correlation function of the wind speed at a single point. The mean wind speed scaling is found to be necessary to match the distribution of generation on country-level, with NEWA-GWA2 and ERA5-GWA2 showing highest accuracy and precision for simulating large-scale wind generation time-series.},

  abstract = {Lake ice is an important feature of the physical landscape at northern latitudes. Not only does the presence of lake ice help modulate weather and climate but it also plays an important role in travel between northern communities. Furthermore, the thickness of ice cover can impact overwintering fish habitat and access to fresh water during winter months. Lake ice cover and lake ice thickness are two notable climate proxies identified by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) as Essential Climate Variables (ECVs). Changes in ice thickness can impact lakes freezing to bed which in turn affect permafrost thaw while longer periods of open water can impact heat transfer to the atmosphere. With recent climate warming in the Northern Hemisphere, there are general trends towards thinner ice and an increase in the length of the open water season. However, the paucity of in-situ observations in many countries has led to remote sensing playing an ever-increasing role for lake ice monitoring. This paper reviews progress in lake ice research conducted using active microwave remote sensing over the last 50 years and highlights areas where future developments are needed. Analysis of the literature found that the diversity of study areas where this work is taking place has increased, incorporating more lake sites from the midlatitudes in North America, Europe, and Asia. Additionally, clear connections can be made between the launch of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites and patterns in the use of certain radar frequencies in scientific studies. This review also discusses evolving theories concerning the scattering mechanisms associated with lake ice as well as the current state of lake ice cover and ice thickness retrieval methods. The paper concludes with a suite of recommendations for future research, highlighting work that is needed on: 1) advancing our understanding of the response of active microwave signals to lake ice properties; 2) applying machine learning algorithms to lake ice classification; 3) further exploring the retrieval of ice thickness from imaging SAR and radar altimetry data; and 4) other considerations such as data availability and the topic of snow on lake ice.},

  abstract = {Uncertainties about landscape evolution under cold, nonglacial conditions raise a question fundamental to periglacial geomorphology: what and where are periglacial landscapes? To answer this, with an emphasis on lowland periglacial areas, the present study distinguishes between characteristic and polygenetic periglacial landscapes, and considers how complete is the footprint of periglaciation? Using a conceptual framework of landscape sensitivity and change, the study applies four geological criteria (periglacial persistence, extraglacial regions, ice-rich substrates, and aggradation of sediment and permafrost) through the last 3.5 million years of the late Cenozoic to identify permafrost regions in the Northern Hemisphere. In limited areas of unglaciated permafrost regions are characteristic periglacial landscapes whose morphology has been adjusted essentially to present (i.e., Holocene interglacial) process conditions, namely thermokarst landscapes, and mixed periglacial{\textendash}alluvial and periglacial{\textendash}deltaic landscapes. More widespread in past and present permafrost regions are polygenetic periglacial landscapes, which inherit ancient landsurfaces on which periglacial landforms are superimposed to varying degrees, presently or previously. Such landscapes comprise relict accumulation plains and aprons, frost-susceptible and nonfrost-susceptible terrains, cryopediments, and glacial{\textendash}periglacial landscapes. Periglaciation can produce topographic fingerprints at mesospatial scales (103{\textendash}105 m): (1) relict accumulation plains and aprons form where long-term sedimentation buried landsurfaces; and (2) plateaux with convexo{\textendash}concave hillslopes and inset with valleys, formed by bedrock brecciation, mass wasting, and stream incision in frost-susceptible terrain.},

Many countries around the world have recorded a decrease in deployment of physical infrastructure for hydrological measurements; developing countries especially have less of this infrastructure and, where it exists, it is poorly maintained. Satellite remote sensing can bridge this gap, and has been applied by hydrologists over the years, with the earliest applications in water body and flood mapping. With the availability of more optical satellites with relatively low temporal resolutions globally, satellite data are commonly used for mapping of water bodies, testing of inundation models, precipitation monitoring, and mapping of flood extent. Use of satellite data to estimate hydrological parameters continues to increase due to use of better sensors, improvement in knowledge of and utilization of satellite data, and expansion of research topics. A review of applications of satellite remote sensing in surface water modelling, mapping and parameter estimation is presented, and its limitations for surface water applications are also discussed.},

Here, daily ROS events with flood-generating potential8 are simulated over western North America for a historical (2000{\textendash}2013) and future (forced under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.59) period with the Weather Research and Forecasting model; 4\,km resolution allows the basin-scale ROS flood risk to be assessed. In the warmer climate, we show that ROS becomes less frequent at lower elevations due to snowpack declines, particularly in warmer areas (for example, the Pacific maritime region). By contrast, at higher elevations where seasonal snowcover persists, ROS becomes more frequent due to a shift from snowfall to rain. Accordingly, the water available for runoff10 increases for 55\% of western North American river basins, with corresponding increases in flood risk of 20{\textendash}200\%, the greatest changes of which are projected for the Sierra Nevada, the Colorado River headwaters and the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Thus, flood control and water resource planning must consider ROS to fully quantify changes in flood risk with anthropogenic warming.},

Here we compare long-term changes in the snowmelt and SWE from snow monitoring stations in western North America and find 34\% of stations exhibit increasing winter snowmelt trends (P\,{$<$}\,0.05), a factor of three larger than the 11\% showing SWE declines (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). Snowmelt trends are highly sensitive to temperature and an underlying warming signal, whereas SWE trends are more sensitive to precipitation variability. Thus, continental-scale snow water resources are in steeper decline than inferred from SWE trends alone. More winter snowmelt will complicate future water resource planning and management.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Ponds and lakes are abundant in Arctic permafrost lowlands. They play an important role in Arctic wetland ecosystems by regulating carbon, water, and energy fluxes and providing freshwater habitats. However, ponds, i.e., waterbodies with surface areas smaller than 1.\,0\,{\texttimes}\,104\,m2, have not been inventoried on global and regional scales. The Permafrost Region Pond and Lake (PeRL) database presents the results of a circum-Arctic effort to map ponds and lakes from modern (2002{\textendash}2013) high-resolution aerial and satellite imagery with a resolution of 5\,m or better. The database also includes historical imagery from 1948 to 1965 with a resolution of 6\,m or better. PeRL includes 69 maps covering a wide range of environmental conditions from tundra to boreal regions and from continuous to discontinuous permafrost zones. Waterbody maps are linked to regional permafrost landscape maps which provide information on permafrost extent, ground ice volume, geology, and lithology. This paper describes waterbody classification and accuracy, and presents statistics of waterbody distribution for each site. Maps of permafrost landscapes in Alaska, Canada, and Russia are used to extrapolate waterbody statistics from the site level to regional landscape units. PeRL presents pond and lake estimates for a total area of 1.\,4\,{\texttimes}\,106\,km2 across the Arctic, about 17\,\% of the Arctic lowland (\,{$<$}\,\,300\,m\,a.s.l.) land surface area. PeRL waterbodies with sizes of 1.\,0\,{\texttimes}\,106\,m2 down to 1.\,0\,{\texttimes}\,102\,m2 contributed up to 21\,\% to the total water fraction. Waterbody density ranged from 1.\,0\,{\texttimes}\,10 to 9.\,4\,{\texttimes}\,101\,km-2. Ponds are the dominant waterbody type by number in all landscapes representing 45{\textendash}99\,\% of the total waterbody number. The implementation of PeRL size distributions in land surface models will greatly improve the investigation and projection of surface inundation and carbon fluxes in permafrost lowlands.

  abstract = {As the Arctic warms, vegetation is responding, and satellite measures indicate widespread greening at high latitudes. This `greening of the Arctic' is among the world's most important large-scale ecological responses to global climate change. However, a consensus is emerging that the underlying causes and future dynamics of so-called Arctic greening and browning trends are more complex, variable and inherently scale-dependent than previously thought. Here we summarize the complexities of observing and interpreting high-latitude greening to identify priorities for future research. Incorporating satellite and proximal remote sensing with in-situ data, while accounting for uncertainties and scale issues, will advance the study of past, present and future Arctic vegetation change.},

  abstract = {Point set registration is a key component in many computer vision tasks. The goal of point set registration is to assign correspondences between two sets of points and to recover the transformation that maps one point set to the other. Multiple factors, including an unknown non-rigid spatial transformation, large dimensionality of point set, noise and outliers, make the point set registration a challenging problem. We introduce a probabilistic method, called the Coherent Point Drift (CPD) algorithm, for both rigid and non-rigid point set registration. We consider the alignment of two point sets as a probability density estimation problem. We fit the GMM centroids (representing the first point set) to the data (the second point set) by maximizing the likelihood. We force the GMM centroids to move coherently as a group to preserve the topological structure of the point sets. In the rigid case, we impose the coherence constraint by re-parametrization of GMM centroid locations with rigid parameters and derive a closed form solution of the maximization step of the EM algorithm in arbitrary dimensions. In the non-rigid case, we impose the coherence constraint by regularizing the displacement field and using the variational calculus to derive the optimal transformation. We also introduce a fast algorithm that reduces the method computation complexity to linear. We test the CPD algorithm for both rigid and non-rigid transformations in the presence of noise, outliers and missing points, where CPD shows accurate results and outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {With a planned launch no later than September 2018, the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) will provide a global distribution of geodetic elevation measurements for both the terrain surface and relative canopy heights. The Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) instrument on-board ICESat-2 is a LiDAR system sensitive to the photon level. The photon-counting technology has many advantages for space-based altimetry, but also has challenges, particularly with delineating the signal from background noise. As such, a current unknown facing the ecosystem community is the performance of ICESat-2 for terrain and canopy height retrievals. This paper aims to provide the science user community of ICESat-2 land/vegetation data products with a realistic understanding of the performance characteristics and potential uncertainties related to the vertical sampling error, which includes the error in the perceived height value and the measurement precision. Terrain and canopy heights from simulated ICESat-2 data are evaluated against the airborne LiDAR ground truth values to provide a baseline performance uncertainty for multiple ecosystems. Simulation results for wooded savanna and boreal forest result in a mean bias error and error uncertainty (precision) for terrain height retrievals at 0.06 m (0.24 m RMSE) and -0.13 m (0.77 m RMSE). In contrast, results over ecosystems with dense vegetation show terrain errors of 1.93 m (1.66 m RMSE) and 2.52 m (3.18 m RMSE), indicating problems extracting terrain height due to diminished ground returns. Simulated top of canopy heights from ICESat-2 underestimated true top of canopy returns for all types analyzed with errors ranging from 0.28 m (1.39 m RMSE) to 1.25 m (2.63 m RMSE). These results comprise a first step in a comprehensive evaluation of ICESat-2 anticipated performance. Future steps will include solar noise impact analysis and investigation into performance discrepancy between visible and near-infrared wavelengths.},

These approaches aim to model the non-linear dynamics and complex interactions between multiple variables, which are challenging to approximate. Additionally, many such numerical models are computationally intensive, especially when modeling the atmospheric phenomenon at a fine-grained spatial and temporal resolution. Recent data-driven approaches based on machine learning instead aim to directly solve a downstream forecasting or projection task by learning a data-driven functional mapping using deep neural networks. However, these networks are trained using curated and homogeneous climate datasets for specific spatiotemporal tasks, and thus lack the generality of numerical models. We develop and demonstrate ClimaX, a flexible and generalizable deep learning model for weather and climate science that can be trained using heterogeneous datasets spanning different variables, spatio-temporal coverage, and physical groundings. ClimaX extends the Transformer architecture with novel encoding and aggregation blocks that allow effective use of available compute while maintaining general utility. ClimaX is pre-trained with a self-supervised learning objective on climate datasets derived from CMIP6. The pre-trained ClimaX can then be fine-tuned to address a breadth of climate and weather tasks, including those that involve atmospheric variables and spatio-temporal scales unseen during pretraining. Compared to existing data-driven baselines, we show that this generality in ClimaX results in superior performance on benchmarks for weather forecasting and climate projections, even when pretrained at lower resolutions and compute budgets.},

  abstract = {Tectonics and erosion are the driving forces in the evolution of mountain belts, but the identification of their relative contributions remains a fundamental scientific problem in relation to the understanding of both geodynamic processes and surface processes. The issue is further complicated through the roles of climate and climatic change. For more than a century it has been thought that the present high topography of western Scandinavia was created by some form of active tectonic uplift during the Cenozoic. This has been based mainly on the occurrence of surface remnants and accordant summits at high elevation believed to have been graded to sea level, the inference of increasing erosion rates toward the present-day based on the age of offshore erosion products and the erosion histories inferred from apatite fission track data, and on over-burial and seaward tilting of coast-proximal sediments. In contrast to this received wisdom, we demonstrate here that the evidence can be substantially explained by a model of protracted exhumation of topography since the Caledonide Orogeny. Exhumation occurred by gravitational collapse, continental rifting and erosion. Initially, tectonic exhumation dominated, although erosion rates were high. The subsequent demise of onshore tectonic activity allowed slow erosion to become the dominating exhumation agent. The elevation limiting and landscape shaping activities of wet-based alpine glaciers, cirques and periglacial processes gained importance with the greenhouse{\textendash}icehouse climatic deterioration at the Eocene{\textendash}Oligocene boundary and erosion rates increased. The flattish surfaces that these processes can produce suggest an alternative to the traditional tectonic interpretation of these landscape elements in western Scandinavia. The longevity of western Scandinavian topography is due to the failure of rifting processes in destroying the topography entirely, and to the buoyant upward feeding of replacement crustal material commensurate with exhumation unloading. We emphasize the importance of differentiating the morphological, sedimentological and structural signatures of recent active tectonics from the effects of long-term exhumation and isostatic rebound in understanding the evolution of similar elevated regions.},

Our hypothesis, in contrast, honours well-documented physical laws and the present wealth of actual data constraints (as opposed to dogma-biased inferences). After careful consideration of the points raised by Chalmers et al. (2010) we maintain our simple explanation for the evolution of Scandinavian topography, as it honours well-documented actual data constraints, such as crustal structure (including its spatio-temporal variability), thermal history in the eastern North Sea, global and regional climatic change (including eustacy) and sedimentation in the adjacent basins. The inevitable conclusion is that, although more data constraints are desirable, the current best fit hypothesis, is that the Scandinavian topography is of Caledonide origin, and has been shaped by fluvial and glacial buzzsaw and periglacial processes, and most recently (last few Myr) been re-invigorated by extensive glacial erosion in the fjords and on the shelf.},

These perturbations may cause major reshuffling of Arctic species compositions and functional trait profiles and diversity, thereby affecting ecosystem processes of the whole tundra region. Earlier research has detected important drivers of the change in plant functional traits under warming climate, but studies on one key factor, snow cover, are almost totally lacking. Here we integrate plot-scale vegetation data with detailed climate and snow information using machine learning methods to model the responsiveness of tundra communities to different scenarios of warming and snow cover duration. Our results show that decreasing snow cover, together with warming temperatures, can substantially modify biotic communities and their trait compositions, with future plant communities projected to be occupied by taller plants with larger leaves and faster resource acquisition strategies. As another finding, we show that, while the local functional diversity may increase, simultaneous biotic homogenization across tundra communities is likely to occur. The manifestation of climate warming on tundra vegetation is highly dependent on the evolution of snow conditions. Given this, realistic assessments of future ecosystem functioning require acknowledging the role of snow in tundra vegetation models.},

The downscaled climate data for the late 20th century, mid-21st century, and late 21st-century is used to drive the National Weather Service operational snow model, SNOW-17, to produce high-resolution (0.1{$^\circ$} {\texttimes} 0.1{$^\circ$}) projections of daily snowfall, snow depth, and snow cover for Wisconsin. These snow projections will guide wildlife scientists in climate change impact studies and the development of adaptation strategies for the state, in addition to being of value to hydrologists, agricultural scientists, and other experts. SNOW-17 simulations suggest a dramatic shortening of the Wisconsin snow season, with the greatest snowfall and snow depth reductions in spring, particularly over northern Wisconsin. Snowfall is substantially reduced in response to projected warming and only slightly offset by a projected increase in cold-season precipitation. Percent reductions in snow depth are likely to be even more impressive than in snowfall, given not only a reduced frequency that falling precipitation will be in frozen form but also an enhanced snowmelt due to rising temperatures.

  abstract = {A tectonostratigraphic model for the evolution of rift basins has been built, involving three distinct stages of basin development separated by key unconformities or unconformity complexes. The architecture and signature of the sediment infill for each stage are discussed, with reference to the northern North Sea palaeorift system. The proto-rift stage describes the rift onset with either doming or flexural subsidence. In the case of early doming, a proto-rift unconformity separates this stage from the subsequent main rift stage. Active stretching and rotation of fault blocks during the rift stage is terminated by the development of the syn-rift unconformity. Where crustal separation is accomplished, a break-up unconformity commonly marks the boundary to the overlying thermal relaxation or post-rift stage. Tabular architectures, thickening across relatively steep faults, characterize the proto-rift stage. Syn-rift architectures are much more variable. Depending on the ability of the sediment supply to fill the waxing and waning accommodation created during rotation and subsidence, one-, two- or three-fold lithosome architectures are likely to develop. During the post-rift stage, an early phase with coarse clastic infilling of remnant rift topography often precedes late stage widening of the basin and filling with fine-grained sediments.},

Most of these DEMs are heavily post-processed or merged, so that physical error modelling becomes difficult and statistical error modelling is required instead. We propose a three-step methodological framework for assessing and correcting DEMs to quantify glacier elevation changes: (i) remove DEM shifts, (ii) check for elevation-dependent biases, and (iii) check for higher-order, sensor-specific biases. A simple, analytic and robust method to co-register elevation data is presented in regions where stable terrain is either plentiful (case study New Zealand) or limited (case study Svalbard). The method is demonstrated using the three global elevation data sets available to date, SRTM, ICESat and the ASTER GDEM, and with automatically generated DEMs from satellite stereo instruments of ASTER and SPOT5HRS. After 3-D co-registration, significant biases related to elevation were found in some of the stereoscopic DEMs. Biases related to the satellite acquisition geometry (along/cross track) were detected at two frequencies in the automatically generated ASTER DEMs. The higher frequency bias seems to be related to satellite jitter, most apparent in the backlooking pass of the satellite. The origins of the more significant lower frequency bias is uncertain. ICESat-derived elevations are found to be the most consistent globally available elevation data set available so far. Before performing regional-scale glacier elevation change studies or mosaicking DEMs from multiple individual tiles (e.g. ASTER GDEM), we recommend to co-register all elevation data to ICESat as a global vertical reference system.},

Glaciers look solid and robust, but observing them for only a couple of years shows that they are dynamic and change shape all the time. The lower glaciers come, the greater the contrast with the surrounding landscape. Many glaciers in the world enter pastures and forests. It is not surprising that laymen, artists and scientists have reported on the behaviour of large valley glaciers. A wealth of information on glacier fluctuations in historical times has thus become available, notably from the Alps, Norway and Iceland. Combined with the results of geomorphological studies it has become possible to reconstruct the history of an ever growing number of glaciers. More systematic mapping of glaciers started only 100 years ago. The most comprehensive data set is related to length variations. It is relatively easy to make annual observations regarding the length of a valley glacier. Volunteers from Alpine clubs and other organisations have played an important role in compiling an impressive data set (World Glacier Monitoring Service, University of Z{\"u}rich). In recent years the possibilities to map and monitor glaciers have increased enormously, mainly due to new remote sensing techniques.},

Many physical downscaling models have been developed and applied to make these maps. However, as the existing models require extensive computations and time, statistical models with higher efficiency are being studied. Statistical models such as regression and machine learning models can quickly calculate wind resource maps, but they have a problem of low accuracy. This study proposes a machine learning model with new topography-derived variables to interpret the physical characteristics of the wind. As the shape of topography, which was unable to be interpreted in previous studies, can be considered with new derived variables, a significant performance improvement was identified. The analysis was conducted using 1 km Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) results and ERA5 reanalysis data from South Korea. Two Weibull distribution parameter maps were calculated and used as input and output data. Three collections of derived variables were devised and compared. Therefore, the multi-resolution topography data showed the highest improvements with approximately 15\% reduction in root mean square error (RMSE) for both the linear regression and machine learning models. In particular, the land area showed a decrease of 20\%. The best proposed models showed an RMSE of 7\% and 8\% for two Weibull parameters. The results are expected to serve as a reference for continuing research and utilization of statistical models.},

  abstract = {Snowdrift, which results from deposition of wind transported snow, has been primarily estimated empirically rather than using physically-based modeling since the snow redistribution process is extremely complex. This study demonstrates a practical predictive model for snow redistribution based on the Linear Particle Distribution (LPD) equation, which consists of snow surface diffusion, snow surface advection, and snow surface erosion components. Here, we focus on numerical model development and implementation for two-dimensional natural terrains at meter-scale resolutions with and without perforated snow fences, which has been difficult to model in a two-dimensional field. First, a selected numerical scheme was implemented in the Snow Movement Over Open Terrain for Hydrology (SMOOTH) model platform and tested by the exact solutions under a few well-defined boundary conditions. Then, to simulate snowdrifts around the snow detention structures in the middle of the computational domain, an equivalent solid snow fence concept was introduced and tested. The model was applied to several terrains in the Laramie Range, Wyoming, and at two sites on the North Slope of Alaska, where wind-induced snow redistribution plays a major role. Data from Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry were used to calibrate and validate the model. The numerical snow redistribution model effectively reproduces the observed snowdrift distributions when snow densification and snowmelt effects were minimal. The model applications illustrated that the diffusion effect generally dominated snow redistribution with limited contributions of advection and erosion effects for abrupt terrain transition and perforated object, respectively.

To address this shortcoming, correlations between the ELAs of 513 modern cirque glaciers and present-day climatic and topographic variables across Scandinavia, as well as regional trends in ELA and climate, are analysed. ELAs are calculated using the Area-Altitude-Balance-Ratio method, with a ratio of 1.5\,{$\pm$}\,0.4. Results indicate that glacier ELAs are strongly correlated with distance from the coast. This reflects the present-day precipitation pattern of the region (characterised by high precipitation near the sea) and demonstrates a climate dominated by a maritime-continental transition. Temperature explains differences in glacier ELA regional trends as well as ELA changes with latitude. Following standard meteorological convention, Scandinavia is divided into two macro-climate regions and analyses are run within the macro-regions as well as the complete dataset. The strength of correlations between ELA and precipitation increases when the study is divided into northern and southern macro-regions. These results test long held assumptions about relationships between climate and cirque glacier ELA, which is of particular relevance to palaeoclimatic studies based on the reconstruction of former cirque glaciers.},

  abstract = {Cirques are glacially eroded, bowl-shaped depressions, characterised by steep headwalls and flat or overdeepened floors. Given their association with past glaciers, cirques are sometimes used as proxies for palaeoclimate. However, cirques are shaped over multiple glacial cycles, and their usefulness as palaeoclimate indicators therefore remains open to question. In this paper, we map 3984 glacier-free cirques across the Scandinavian Peninsula and analyse variations in cirque floor altitude (CFA). We explore the relationships between CFAs and cirque aspect, latitude, longitude, and distance to the coast. We test the validity of using CFAs as indicators of palaeoclimate through comparison with the equilibrium-line altitudes (ELAs) of 513 modern cirque glaciers. Results indicate that both CFAs and modern cirque-glacier ELAs decrease with latitude and vary with aspect, being generally lowest on east-facing slopes. However, the clearest and strongest trend in both CFAs and modern cirque glacier ELAs is an increase in elevation with distance from the modern coast (i.e., distance `inland'). This likely indicates that similar climatic gradients, particularly an inland reduction in precipitation, acted to regulate former sites of glacier initiation (reflected by CFAs) and modern glacier ELAs. This would imply that CFAs are a useful proxy for palaeoclimate. However, we note that both CFAs and modern ELAs reflect the general topography of this region (with increasing elevations moving inland), and the glacial history of the area (indirectly linked to palaeoclimate) may have played a role in regulating where cirques have formed. For these reasons, we suggest that palaeoclimatic interpretations derived from CFAs should be treated with caution.},

These neotectonic features are likely to be mostly related to gravitational effects of excess mass along the Mohns Ridge, within the Iceland Plateau and the southern Scandinavian mountains, to Pliocene/Pleistocene sedimentary loading/unloading, and to postglacial rebound. A major seismic pulse most likely accompanied each of the deglaciations following the multiple glaciation cycles in mainland Fennoscandia during the last 600,000 years. Seismic pumping associated with these glaciation cycles may have facilitated fluid and gas leakage from organic-rich sediments and reservoirs through gas chimneys, ultimately forming pockmarks on the sea floor. This mechanism could also have contributed to the concentration and pumping of hydrocarbons from their source rocks to reservoir formations. Pressure decrease associated with removal of sedimentary overburden on the Norwegian shelf has caused expansion of gas and resulted in expulsion of oil from the traps. Where uplift and tilting resulted in local extension, seal breaching and spillage have also occurred. Future rock avalanches and landslides, triggered by earthquakes, could generate tsunamis in fjords and lakes and constitute the greatest seismic hazard to society in Norway. Our understanding of neotectonic activity is consequently important for the evaluation of hazard and risk related to rockslope instability.},

They recognize its merits in providing unbiased estimates with minimum variance. Several statistical packages now have the facilities they require, as do some geographic information systems. In the latter kriging is an option for interpolation that can be done at the press of a few buttons. Unfortunately, the ease conferred by this allows one to krige without understanding and to produce unreliable and even misleading results. Crucial for sound kriging is a plausible function for the spatial covariances or, more widely, of the variogram. The variogram must be estimated reliably and then modelled with valid mathematical functions. This requires an understanding of the assumptions in the underlying theory of random processes on which geostatistics is based. Here we guide readers through computing the sample variogram and modelling it by weighted least-squares fitting. We explain how to choose the most suitable functions by a combination of graphics and statistical diagnostics. Ordinary kriging follows straightforwardly from the model, but small changes in the model function and its parameters can affect the kriging error variances. When kriging is automated these effects remain unknown. We explain the choices to be made when kriging, i.e. whether the support is at points or over blocks, and whether the predictions are global or within moving windows.},

Deeper understanding of the role of different climatic drivers on palsa decay, however, is lacking. We use meteorological data and aerial photographs from 1955 to 2016 to statistically identify the most important climatic drivers affecting changes in lateral-temporal palsa decay rates in the largest coherent palsa complex in Sweden, Viss{\'a}tvuopmi. We show that wetter, warmer and shorter winters are the main causes of large and rapid changes in lateral-palsa extent since the mid-1950s. By analyzing meteorological data from the 1880s to present, we show that average annual temperature conditions have been unfavourable for palsas for more than a century and average annual precipitation conditions have been unfavourable since the 1940s. The decay rates have likely been amplified over the past 50-60 years, and in particular over the most recent decades, due to the combined effect of adverse air temperature and precipitation conditions. Palsa loss is expected to continue, most likely at a higher rate than today, with serious ecological impacts as a consequence.},

The state of the snowpack over the TP is a major research focus due to its great impact on the headwaters of a dozen major Asian rivers. While many studies have attempted to validate atmospheric reanalyses over the TP area in terms of temperature or precipitation, there have been {\textendash} remarkably {\textendash} no studies aimed at systematically comparing the snow depth or snow cover in global reanalyses with satellite and in situ data. Yet, snow in reanalyses provides critical surface information for forecast systems from the medium to sub-seasonal timescales.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Here, snow depth and snow cover from four recent global reanalysis products, namely the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 and ERA-Interim reanalyses, the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55) and the NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2), are inter-compared over the TP region. The reanalyses are evaluated against a set of 33 in situ station observations, as well as against the Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) snow cover and a satellite microwave snow depth dataset. The high temporal correlation coefficient (0.78) between the IMS snow cover and the in situ observations provides confidence in the station data despite the relative paucity of in situ measurement sites and the harsh operating conditions.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}While several reanalyses show a systematic overestimation of the snow depth or snow cover, the reanalyses that assimilate local in situ observations or IMS snow cover are better capable of representing the shallow, transient snowpack over the TP region. The latter point is clearly demonstrated by examining the family of reanalyses from the ECMWF, of which only the older ERA-Interim assimilated IMS snow cover at high altitudes, while ERA5 did not consider IMS snow cover for high altitudes. We further tested the sensitivity of the ERA5-Land model in offline experiments, assessing the impact of blown snow sublimation, snow cover to snow depth conversion and, more importantly, excessive snowfall. These results suggest that excessive snowfall might be the primary factor for the large overestimation of snow depth and cover in ERA5 reanalysis. Pending a solution for this common model precipitation bias over the Himalayas and the TP, future snow reanalyses that optimally combine the use of satellite snow cover and in situ snow depth observations in the assimilation and analysis cycles have the potential to improve medium-range to sub-seasonal forecasts for water resources applications.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

A simple computer model was developed to simulate the modulation effects of winter snow thickness on the development and destruction of these features. The one-dimensional model tracks the annual mass budgets of ice-rich peat and the overlying dry peat layer by estimating the annual accretion or thaw of ice within the peat. This is accomplished with the aid of a solution to the Stefan problem, modified to incorporate the influence of the thermal resistance of layers overlying the zone of frost or thaw. The elevation of a palsa above surrounding organic terrain is determined by the Archimedean principle. The thickness of the dry and ice-rich peat layers, both lower in density than the surrounding wet peat, vary through time. The model demonstrates the sensitivity of the system to low snow-cover years, and crudely mimics the development of a palsa initiated by removal of the snow cover at an experimental site in Finland.},

They were behind their present-day limits in the Arctic archipelagos, and most likely absent from the British Isles and from many European and Mediterranean mountains, such as Scandinavia, Iceland, the Urals, the Carpathians, the Pyrenees, and the Iberian, Italian and Moroccan mountains. They had a very reduced extension in the Caucasus, the Alps and the Balkans. Consequently, Middle Holocene glacial landforms are rarely observed. The landforms in the interior of the mountain cirques were erased by the glacier advances in the Late Holocene. The evolution of European glaciers is similar to the rest of the mountains of the Northern Hemisphere. The time of the glacier minimum extent is variable throughout the Middle Holocene in each region, in relation to local factors. The behaviour of glaciers in the Southern Hemisphere is also very similar to those in Europe, reaching their minimum extent in some cases in the Early Holocene and in others in the Middle Holocene, although with great variability depending on the precipitation regime in each region. In most regions of both hemispheres, glaciers began to advance from the mid to late Middle Holocene. The difference in the chronology of the Holocene Thermal Maximum depends on the harmonisation between different climatic proxies and local conditions in each region, mainly related to precipitation.},

Here we investigate the water flow paths from a subglacial lake, which drained beneath the Greenland ice sheet in 2011. Our observations suggest that the lake was fed by surface meltwater flowing down a nearby moulin, and that the draining water reached the ice margin via a subglacial tunnel. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar-derived measurements of ice surface motion acquired in 1995 suggest that a similar event may have occurred 16 years earlier, and we propose that, as the climate warms, increasing volumes of surface meltwater routed to the bed will cause such events to become more common in the future.},

  abstract = {Analyses of a mid-Holocene climate model ensemble and paleo-proxies reveal that the mid-Holocene Northern Hemisphere was warm. The Holocene thermal maximum was characterized by strong summer solar heating that substantially increased the summertime temperature relative to preindustrial climate. However, the summer warming was compensated by weaker winter insolation, and the annual mean temperature of the Holocene thermal maximum remains ambiguous. Using multimodel mid-Holocene simulations, we show that the annual mean Northern Hemisphere temperature is strongly correlated with the degree of Arctic amplification and sea ice loss. Additional model experiments show that the summer Arctic sea ice loss persists into winter and increases the mid- and high-latitude temperatures. These results are evaluated against four proxy datasets to verify that the annual mean northern high-latitude temperature during the mid-Holocene was warmer than the preindustrial climate, because of the seasonally rectified temperature increase driven by the Arctic amplification. This study offers a resolution to the ``Holocene temperature conundrum'', a well-known discrepancy between paleo-proxies and climate model simulations of Holocene thermal maximum.},

  abstract = {Between 2012 and 2018 we mapped near-peak seasonal snow depths across two swaths covering 126 km2 in Northern Alaska using aerial structure-from-motion photogrammetry and lidar surveys. The surveys were validated by over a hundred thousand ground-based depth measurements. Using a quantitative method for identifying drift areas, we conducted a snowdrift census that showed on average 18\% of the study area is covered by snowdrifts each winter, with 40\% of the snow-water-equivalent contained in the drifts. Within the census we identified six types of drifts, some of which fill each winter, others which do not. The seasonal drift evolution was distinctly different in the two swaths, a result largely explained by topographic differences. Using four metrics from the field of image quality analysis, we tested the year-to-year fidelity of these drift patterns, finding overall high year-to-year similarity, but with higher similarity values for filling drifts, and higher similarity values in one swath versus the other, again a function of the topography. These high drift fidelity values are best explained by climatically convergent winter-cumulative windblown snow fluxes interacting with drift traps to produce the same drifts year after year. However, due to the existence of filling versus nonfilling drifts, and a predicted increasing frequency of rain-on-snow events in the Arctic, future snowdrift patterns and drift evolution pathways in the Arctic could diverge from those of today, with direct hydrologic impacts.},

  abstract = {In many real-world scenarios, rewards extrinsic to the agent are extremely sparse, or absent altogether. In such cases, curiosity can serve as an intrinsic reward signal to enable the agent to explore its environment and learn skills that might be useful later in its life. We formulate curiosity as the error in an agent's ability to predict the consequence of its own actions in a visual feature space learned by a self-supervised inverse dynamics model. Our formulation scales to high-dimensional continuous state spaces like images, bypasses the difficulties of directly predicting pixels, and, critically, ignores the aspects of the environment that cannot affect the agent. The proposed approach is evaluated in two environments: VizDoom and Super Mario Bros. Three broad settings are investigated: 1) sparse extrinsic reward, where curiosity allows for far fewer interactions with the environment to reach the goal; 2) exploration with no extrinsic reward, where curiosity pushes the agent to explore more efficiently; and 3) generalization to unseen scenarios (e.g. new levels of the same game) where the knowledge gained from earlier experience helps the agent explore new places much faster than starting from scratch.

Despite its global significance, a comprehensive account of its evolution from independent nucleation centres to its maximum extent is conspicuously lacking. Here, a first-order, thermomechanical model, robustly constrained by empirical evidence, is used to investigate the dynamics of the EISC throughout its build-up to its maximum configuration. The ice flow model is coupled to a reference climate and applied at 10~km spatial resolution across a domain that includes the three main spreading centres of the Celtic, Fennoscandian and Barents Sea ice sheets. The model is forced with the NGRIP palaeo-isotope curve from 37 ka BP onwards and model skill is assessed against collated flowsets, marginal moraines, exposure ages and relative sea-level history. The evolution of the EISC to its LGM configuration was complex and asynchronous; the western, maritime margins of the Fennoscandian and Celtic ice sheets responded rapidly and advanced across their continental shelves by 29 ka BP, yet the maximum aerial extent (5.48~{\texttimes}~106~km2) and volume (7.18~{\texttimes}~106~km3) of the ice complex was attained some 6 ka later at c. 22.7 ka BP. This maximum stand was short-lived as the North Sea and Atlantic margins were already in retreat whilst eastern margins were still advancing up until c. 20 ka BP. High rates of basal erosion are modelled beneath ice streams and outlet glaciers draining the Celtic and Fennoscandian ice sheets with extensive preservation elsewhere due to frozen subglacial conditions, including much of the Barents and Kara seas. Here, and elsewhere across the Norwegian shelf and North Sea, high pressure subglacial conditions would have promoted localised gas hydrate formation.},

  abstract = {The Eurasian ice sheet complex (EISC) was the third largest ice mass during the Last Glacial Maximum with a span of over 4500 km and responsible for around 20 m of eustatic sea-level lowering. Whilst recent terrestrial and marine empirical insights have improved understanding of the chronology, pattern and rates of retreat of this vast ice sheet, a concerted attempt to model the deglaciation of the EISC honouring these new constraints is conspicuously lacking. Here, we apply a first-order, thermomechanical ice sheet model, validated against a diverse suite of empirical data, to investigate the retreat of the EISC after 23 ka BP, directly extending the work of Patton et al. (2016) who modelled the build-up to its maximum extent. Retreat of the ice sheet complex was highly asynchronous, reflecting contrasting regional sensitivities to climate forcing, oceanic influence, and internal dynamics. Most rapid retreat was experienced across the Barents Sea sector after 17.8 ka BP when this marine-based ice sheet disintegrated at a rate of {\textasciitilde}670 gigatonnes per year (Gt a{\`A}1) through enhanced calving and interior dynamic thinning, driven by oceanic/atmospheric warming and exacerbated by eustatic sea-level rise. From 14.9 to 12.9 ka BP the EISC lost on average 750 Gt a{\`A}1, peaking at rates {$>$}3000 Gt a{\`A}1, roughly equally partitioned between surface melt and dynamic losses, and potentially contributing up to 2.5 m to global sea-level rise during Meltwater Pulse 1A. Independent glacio-isostatic modelling constrained by an extensive inventory of relative sea-level change corroborates our ice sheet loading history of the Barents Sea sector. Subglacial conditions were predominately temperate during deglaciation, with over 6000 subglacial lakes predicted along with an extensive subglacial drainage network. Moreover, the maximum EISC and its isostatic footprint had a profound impact on the proglacial hydrological network, forming the Fleuve Manche mega-catchment which had an area of {\textasciitilde}2.5 {\^A} 106 km2 and drained the present day Vistula, Elbe, Rhine and Thames rivers through the Seine Estuary. During the B{\o}lling/Aller{\o}d oscillation after c. 14.6 ka BP, two major proglacial lakes formed in the Baltic and White seas, buffering meltwater pulses from eastern Fennoscandia through to the Younger Dryas when these massive proglacial freshwater lakes flooded into the North Atlantic Ocean. Deglaciation temporarily abated during the Younger Dryas stadial at 12.9 ka BP, when remnant ice across Svalbard, Franz Josef Land, Novaya Zemlya, Fennoscandia and Scotland experienced a short-lived but dynamic re-advance. The final stage of deglaciation converged on present day ice cover around the Scandes mountains and the Barents Sea by 8.7 ka BP, although the phase-lagged isostatic recovery still continues today.},

  abstract = {Glaciers and their changes through time are increasingly obtained from a wide range of satellite sensors. Due to the often remote location of glaciers in inaccessible and high-mountain terrain, satellite observations frequently provide the only available measurements. Furthermore, satellite data provide observations of glacier characteristics that are difficult to monitor using ground-based measurements, thus complementing the latter. In the Glaciers\_cci project of the European Space Agency (ESA), three of these characteristics are investigated in detail: glacier area, elevation change and surface velocity. We use (a) data from optical sensors to derive glacier outlines, (b) digital elevation models from at least two points in time, (c) repeat altimetry for determining elevation changes, and (d) data from repeat optical and microwave sensors for calculating surface velocity. For the latter, the two sensor types provide complementary information in terms of spatio-temporal coverage. While (c) and (d) can be generated mostly automatically, (a) and (b) require the intervention of an analyst. Largely based on the results of various round robin experiments (multi-analyst benchmark studies) for each of the products, we suggest and describe the most suitable algorithms for product creation and provide recommendations concerning their practical implementation and the required post-processing. For some of the products (area, velocity) post-processing can influence product quality more than the main-processing algorithm.},

Yet as models evolve, so has China's ``state capitalism.'' We argue that a resurgent party-state, motivated by a logic of political survival, has generated political-economic dynamics that better resemble ``party-state capitalism'' than familiar conceptualizations of state capitalism. We demonstrate this by examining three prominent manifestations of China's unique model: party-state encroachment on markets; a blending of functions and interests of state and private ownership; and politicized interactions with foreign capital. Nevertheless, there remain deficits in the party-state's hold over capital, some of which themselves result from Beijing's logic of control. By probing the comparative and historical context of this evolution of China's model, we suggest directions for further inquiry on the consequences of party-state capitalism.},

Various types of curvature can sometimes be used to make general statements about the solutions to a PDE (partial differential equation). Examples are given to show how nonlinear, first and second-order PDEs can be manipulated with simple algebra to get expressions regarding their solutions in terms of curvatures. These expressions are powerful in that they allow us to use our intuitive, geometric understanding of curvature concepts to better understand nonlinear PDEs for which it is often difficult to obtain analytical or numerical solutions.},

Most surface area in glaciated mountain ranges is concentrated below the modern snowline as predicted by the glacial buzzsaw hypothesis. Above the modern snowline the analysed mountain regions all exhibit an exponential decay of surface area with height. On the basis of this decay, the analysed mountain regions fall within three distinct groups primarily reflecting variations in average values of rock column uplift rates. Mountain ranges affected by rapid rock column uplift display high above-snowline relief and large decay lengths, whereas inactive orogens have little relief above the modern snowline. We find a surprisingly simple relation between hypsometry above the local snowline and regional tectonic activity.},

Sentinel-1\&2 satellites provide frequent acquisitions to track water surface dynamics, proxy variables to enable water surface volume monitoring. How do we combine such observations along time for each sensor? What advantages and disadvantages of single-date, monthly or time-windowed estimations? In this context, we analysed the impact of merging information through different types and lengths of time-windows. Satellite observations were processed separately on optical (Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1) water detectors at 10 m resolution. The analysis has been applied at two scales. First, validating with 26 large scenes (110 {\texttimes} 110 km) in different climatic zones in France, time-windows yielded an improvement on radar detection (F1-score improved from 0.72 to 0.8 for 30 days on average logic) while optical performances remained stable (F1-score 0.89). Second, validating reservoir area estimations with 29 instrumented reservoirs (20{\textendash}1250 ha), time-windows presented in all cases an improvement on both optical and radar error for any window length (5{\textendash}30 days). The mean relative absolute error in optical area detection improved from 16.9\% on single measurements to 12.9\% using 15 days time-windows, and from 22.15\% to 15.1\% in radar detection). Regarding reservoir filling rates, we identified an increased negative bias for both sensors when the reservoir is nearly full. This work helped to compare accuracies of separate optical and radar capabilities, where optical statistically outperforms radar at both local and large scale to the detriment of less frequent measurements. Furthermore, we propose a geomorphological indicator of reservoirs to predict the quality of radar area monitoring (R2 = 0.58). In conclusion, we suggest the use of time-windows on operational water mapping or reservoir monitoring systems, using 10{\textendash}20 days time-windows with average logic, providing more frequent and faster information to water managers in periods of crisis (e.g., water shortage) compared to monthly estimations.},

In this study, we use daily snow depth data from 279 meteorological stations across China to investigate the distribution of winter snow depth (December{\textendash}February) from 1980 to 2005 and its impact on vegetation growth, here approximated by satellite-derived vegetation greenness index observations [Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)]. The snow depth trends show strong geographical heterogeneities. An increasing trend ({$>$}0.01 cm yr-1) in maximum and mean winter snow depth is found north of 40{$^\circ$}N (e.g. Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, and Northwest China). A declining trend ({$<-$}0.01 cm yr-1) is observed south of 40{$^\circ$}N, particularly over Central and East China. The effect of changes in snow depth on vegetation growth was examined for several ecosystem types. In deserts, mean winter snow depth is significantly and positively correlated with NDVI during both early (May and June) and mid-growing seasons (July and August), suggesting that winter snow plays a critical role in regulating desert vegetation growth, most likely through persistent effects on soil moisture. In grasslands, there is also a significant positive correlation between winter snow depth and NDVI in the period May{\textendash}June. However, in forests, shrublands, and alpine meadow and tundra, no such correlation is found. These ecosystem-specific responses of vegetation growth to winter snow depth may be due to differences in growing environmental conditions such as temperature and rainfall.},

Satellite LST (Land Surface Temperature) can fill this gap but needs calibrating against in situ air temperatures (Tair). We develop a novel statistical model to convert LST to Tair, developed at 87 high-elevation Chinese Meteorological Administration stations. Tair (daily maximum/minimum temperatures) is compared with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua LST (1330 and 0130 local time) for 8-day composites during 2002-2017. Typically, 80-95\% of the difference between LST and Tair ({$\Delta$}T) is explained using predictors including LST diurnal range, morning heating/nighttime cooling rates, the number of cloud free days/nights, and season (solar angle). LST is corrected to more closely represent Tair by subtracting modeled {$\Delta$}T. We validate the model using an AWS on Zhadang Glacier (5800 m). Trend analysis at the 87 stations (2002-2017) shows corrected LST trends to be similar to original Tair trends. To examine regional contrasts in EDW patterns, elevation profiles of corrected LST trends are derived for three ranges (Qilian Mountains, NyenchenTanglha, and Himalaya). There is limited EDW in the Qilian mountains. Maximum warming is observed around 4,500-5,500 m in NyenchenTanglha, consistent with snowline retreat. In common with other studies, there is stabilization of warming at very high elevations in the Himalaya, including absolute cooling above 6,000 m, but data there are compromised by frequent cloud.},

  abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) is an essential climate variable (ECV) for monitoring the Earth climate system. To ensure accurate retrieval from satellite data, it is important to validate satellite derived LSTs and ensure that they are within the required accuracy and precision thresholds. An emissivity-dependent split-window algorithm with viewing angle dependence and two dualangle algorithms are proposed for the Sentinel-3 SLSTR sensor. Furthermore, these algorithms are validated together with the Sentinel-3 SLSTR operational LST product as well as several emissivitydependent split-window algorithms with in-situ data from a rice paddy site. The LST retrieval algorithms were validated over three different land covers: flooded soil, bare soil, and full vegetation cover. Ground measurements were performed with a wide band thermal infrared radiometer at a permanent station. The coefficients of the proposed split-window algorithm were estimated using the Cloudless Land Atmosphere Radiosounding (CLAR) database: for the three surface types an overall systematic uncertainty (median) of -0.4 K and a precision (robust standard deviation) 1.1 K were obtained. For the Sentinel-3A SLSTR operational LST product, a systematic uncertainty of 1.3 K and a precision of 1.3 K were obtained. A first evaluation of the Sentinel-3B SLSTR operational LST product was also performed: systematic uncertainty was 1.5 K and precision 1.2 K. The results obtained over the three land covers found at the rice paddy site show that the emissivity-dependent split-window algorithms, i.e., the ones proposed here as well as previously proposed algorithms without angular dependence, provide more accurate and precise LSTs than the current version of the operational SLSTR product.},

The RGI was created with limited resources in a short period. Priority was given to completeness of coverage, but a limited, uniform set of attributes is attached to each of the {\textasciitilde}198 000 glaciers in its latest version, 3.2. Satellite imagery from 1999{\textendash}2010 provided most of the outlines. Their total extent is estimated as 726 800 {$\pm$} 34 000 km2. The uncertainty, about {$\pm$}5\%, is derived from careful single-glacier and basin-scale uncertainty estimates and comparisons with inventories that were not sources for the RGI. The main contributors to uncertainty are probably misinterpretation of seasonal snow cover and debris cover. These errors appear not to be normally distributed, and quantifying them reliably is an unsolved problem. Combined with digital elevation models, the RGI glacier outlines yield hypsometries that can be combined with atmospheric data or model outputs for analysis of the impacts of climatic change on glaciers. The RGI has already proved its value in the generation of significantly improved aggregate estimates of glacier mass changes and total volume, and thus actual and potential contributions to sea-level rise.},

  abstract = {Repeatable snow depth patterns have been identified in many regions between years with similar meteorological characteristics. This suggests that snow patterns from previous years could adjust snow deposition in space as a substitution for unmodeled snow processes. Here, we tested a pattern-based snow deposition downscaling routine which assumes (a) a spatially consistent relationship between snow deposition and snow depth, (b) interannually repeatable snow patterns, and (c) unbiased mean snowfall. We investigated these assumptions, and future avenues for improvement, in water-year 2014 over the California Tuolumne River Watershed. 6 km snowfall from an atmospheric model was downscaled to 25 m resolution using snow depth patterns from seven different years, and was compared to a more common terrain-based downscaling method. Snow depth patterns were influenced not only by snow accumulation, but also snowmelt, snow sublimation, and snow density, resulting in pattern-based snow deposition downscaling that was too spatially heterogeneous. However, snow depth simulated using terrain-based downscaling was too spatially homogeneous, and less spatially correlated with observations (r = 0.27), than simulations with pattern-based downscaling using snow depth patterns from the simulation season (r = 0.76), or from a different year (r = 0.52). Overall, modeled snow depth errors at peak-snowpack timing were driven more by atmospheric model snowfall biases than different downscaling methods. In order of most- to least-importance, future research should focus on bias-correcting coarse-scale snowfall estimates, correcting snow deposition patterns for winter snow losses and snow density spatial variability, and identifying the historic periods of most-similar snow accumulation.},

However, the integration of paleoclimate proxies with climate modeling is critical to improving the understanding of climate dynamics. In this paper, a climate system model and proxy records are therefore used to study the role of natural and anthropogenic forcings in driving the global climate. The inverse and forward approaches to paleoclimate data{\textendash}model comparison are applied, and sources of uncertainty are identified and discussed. In the first of two case studies, the climate model simulations are compared with multiproxy temperature reconstructions. Robust solar and volcanic signals are detected in Southern Hemisphere temperatures, with a possible volcanic signal detected in the Northern Hemisphere. The anthropogenic signal dominates during the industrial period. It is also found that seasonal and geographical biases may cause multiproxy reconstructions to overestimate the magnitude of the long-term preindustrial cooling trend. In the second case study, the model simulations are compared with a coral d18O record from the central Pacific Ocean. It is found that greenhouse gases, solar irradiance, and volcanic eruptions all influence the mean state of the central Pacific, but there is no evidence that natural or anthropogenic forcings have any systematic impact on El Nin{\textasciitilde}o{\textendash}Southern Oscillation. The proxy climate relationship is found to change over time, challenging the assumption of stationarity that underlies the interpretation of paleoclimate proxies. These case studies demonstrate the value of paleoclimate data{\textendash}model comparison but also highlight the limitations of current techniques and demonstrate the need to develop alternative approaches.},

Whilst a clear greening trend has been apparent for most of the satellite record's 33 year history (indicating an increase in biomass and productivity), there is now an overall decline in greenness from 2011 to 2014. If this is a new direction of travel for arctic vegetation, rather than just a temporary departure from long-term greening, this has major implications for not only our understanding of the future of arctic vegetation, but also arctic carbon, nutrient and water cycling, surface energy balance and permafrost degradation, and therefore feedback to climate, all of which are strongly influenced by vegetation composition, productivity and biomass. The urgency in understanding what is happening here is clear. Most models predict arctic greening; to what extent are they wrong, and why? Arctic greening has rightly received much attention. Satellite and observational data have consistently confirmed an increase in vegetation cover and productivity in many regions (Xu et al., 2013) caused most notably by the expansion of large stature deciduous shrubs (Myers-Smith et al., 2015). Likewise, field simulation experiments provide strong evidence that greening is driven by warming (Elmendorf et al., 2012). However, the magnitude of the recent browning is large and cannot be ignored. For both the Eurasian Arctic and the Arctic as a whole, Epstein et al. report the 2014 maxNDVI (greenness) to be below the 33-year average. To find lower values than 2014, you have to go back to 1996 for the whole Arctic and to 1993 for the Eurasian Arctic. However, while browning is the overall trend, there is considerable regional variation and the Arctic is not browning everywhere. These findings raise important questions that represent priority challenges, including (1) what is driving the browning? (2) is browning the new trajectory or only a temporary reversal of greening? and (3) what arctic regions and vegeta-},

The bias correction is calculated using data from 1961 to 1970, without distinguishing between seasons, and applied to seasonal data from 1991 to 2000. This choice of time periods is made to maximize the lag between calibration and validation within the ERA40 reanalysis period. Results show that the method performs unexpectedly well. Not only are the mean and other moments of the intensity distribution improved, as expected, but so are a drought and a heavy precipitation index, which depend on the autocorrelation spectra. Given that the corrections were derived without seasonal distinction and are based solely on intensity distributions, a statistical quantity oblivious of temporal correlations, it is encouraging to find that the improvements are present even when seasons and temporal statistics are considered. This encourages the application of this method to multi-decadal climate projections.},

  abstract = {Spatially representative estimates of surface energy exchange from field measurements are required for improving and validating Earth system models and satellite remote sensing algorithms. The scarcity of flux measurements can limit understanding of ecohydrological responses to climate warming, especially in remote regions with limited infrastructure. Direct field measurements often apply the eddy covariance method on stationary towers, but recently, drone-based measurements of temperature, humidity, and wind speed have been suggested as a viable alternative to quantify the turbulent fluxes of sensible (H) and latent heat (LE). A data assimilation framework to infer uncertainty-aware surface flux estimates from sparse and noisy drone-based observations is developed and tested using a turbulence-resolving large eddy simulation (LES) as a forward model to connect surface fluxes to drone observations. The proposed framework explicitly represents the sequential collection of drone data, accounts for sensor noise, includes uncertainty in boundary and initial conditions, and jointly estimates the posterior distribution of a multivariate parameter space. Assuming typical flight times and observational errors of light-weight, multi-rotor drone systems, we first evaluate the information gain and performance of different ensemble-based data assimilation schemes in experiments with synthetically generated observations. It is shown that an iterative ensemble smoother outperforms both the non-iterative ensemble smoother and the particle batch smoother in the given problem, yielding well-calibrated posterior uncertainty with continuous ranked probability scores of 12 W m-2 for both H and LE, with standard deviations of 37 W m-2 (H) and 46 W m-2 (LE) for a 12 min vertical step profile by a single drone. Increasing flight times, using observations from multiple drones, and further narrowing the prior distributions of the initial conditions are viable for reducing the posterior spread. Sampling strategies prioritizing space{\textendash}time exploration without temporal averaging, instead of hovering at fixed locations while averaging, enhance the non-linearities in the forward model and can lead to biased flux results with ensemble-based assimilation schemes. In a set of 18 real-world field experiments at two wetland sites in Norway, drone data assimilation estimates agree with independent eddy covariance estimates, with root mean square error values of 37 W m-2 (H), 52 W m-2 (LE), and 58 W m-2 (H+LE) and correlation coefficients of 0.90 (H), 0.40 (LE), and 0.83 (H+LE). While this comparison uses the simplifying assumptions of flux homogeneity, stationarity, and flat terrain, it is emphasized that the drone data assimilation framework is not confined to these assumptions and can thus readily be extended to more complex cases and other scalar fluxes, such as for trace gases in future studies.},

We first analyze the annual snow frequency measured as the annual number of snow days (NSD), obtaining a significant decreasing trend since the mid-seventies with a NSD reduction of about 50\%; moreover, this magnitude is similar for low and high stations and for winter and spring separately. Then, we analyze the existing correlations with mean temperature and precipitation occurrence obtaining different relationships depending on the season and elevation. Finally, we simulate the observed trends using the connection of DSO with large-scale fields simulated by a General Circulation Model; for this purpose we apply an analog-based statistical downscaling method to obtain an estimation of DSO, working in perfect prognosis conditions using reanalysis data. On the one hand, the downscaling method is able to estimate/predict the DSO with typical values of hit and false alarm rates around 60\% and 2\%, respectively. On the other hand, the annual frequency obtained by averaging the DSO estimations reproduces very well both the observed trends and the high inter-annual variability.

  abstract = {Snow depth observation in potentially dangerous avalanche-starting zones is important for avalanche prediction and dimensioning of permanent protection measures. The possible danger of avalanches complicates measurements of snow depth in the field (e.g. by probing). Therefore, the applicability of terrestrial laser scanning to measure the depth of the snow cover was analysed. Different long-range laser profile measuring systems were used carrying out numerous field campaigns (Vorarlberg, Austrian Alps). The objective of the study was to discover under which meteorological and snowpack conditions the measurements must be taken in order to provide accurate results ({$<$}10~cm). For the first time a detailed investigation focusing on the limitations and properties of different terrestrial laser scanning systems for application in snow and avalanche research is presented and discussed. Results suggest that under adequate measurement conditions the distance between the scanner position and the surface of the snowpack can be measured with an accuracy {$<$}10~cm. Poor weather conditions such as snowfall or fog preclude the collection of reliable data. If the snow surface was wet and the snow grain size was large ({$>$}1~mm) only 50\% of the emitted signal was received, depending on the angle of incidence. In any case, the accuracy decreases with increasing distance to the target. For distances to the object of more than about 500~m, the accuracy that can be achieved with the used TLS measuring systems is rather low and the errors can be significantly larger than 10~cm.},

  abstract = {The energy sector comprises approximately two-thirds of global total greenhouse gas emissions. For this and other reasons, renewable energy resources including wind power are being increasingly harnessed to provide electricity generation potential with negligible emissions of carbon dioxide. The wind energy resource is naturally a function of the climate system because the ``fuel'' is the incident wind speed and thus is determined by the atmospheric circulation. Some recent articles have reported historical declines in measured near-surface wind speeds, leading some to question the continued viability of the wind energy industry. Here we briefly articulate the challenges inherent in accurately quantifying and attributing historical tendencies and making robust projections of likely future wind resources. We then analyze simulations from the current generation of regional climate models and show, at least for the next 50 years, the wind resource in the regions of greatest wind energy penetration will not move beyond the historical envelope of variability. Thus this work suggests that the wind energy industry can, and will, continue to make a contribution to electricity provision in these regions for at least the next several decades.},

  abstract = {Wind energy is a virtually carbon-free and pollution-free electricity source, with global wind resources greatly exceeding electricity demand. Accordingly, the installed capacity of wind turbines grew at an annualized rate of {$>$}20\% from 2000 to 2019 and is projected to increase by a further 50\% by the end of 2023. In this Review, we describe the factors that dictate the wind resource magnitude and variability and illustrate the tools and techniques that are being used to make projections of wind resources and wind turbine operating conditions. Natural variability due to the action of internal climate modes appears to dominate over global-warming-induced non-stationarity over most areas with large wind energy installations or potential. However, there is evidence for increased wind energy resources by the end of the current century in northern Europe and the US Southern Great Plains. New technology trends are changing the sensitivity of wind energy to global climate non-stationarity and, thus, present new challenges and opportunities for innovative research. The evolution of climate modelling to increasingly address mesoscale processes is providing improved projections of both wind resources and wind turbine operating conditions, and will contribute to continued reductions in the levelized cost of energy from wind power generation.},

  abstract = {Winds within the atmospheric boundary layer (i.e., near to Earth's surface) vary across a range of scales from a few meters and sub-second timescales (i.e., the scales of turbulent motions) to extremely large and long-period phenomena (i.e., the primary circulation patterns of the global atmosphere). Winds redistribute momentum and heat, and short- and long-term predictions of wind characteristics have applications to a number of socioeconomic sectors (e.g., engineering infrastructure). Despite its importance, atmospheric flow (i.e., wind) has been subject to less research within the climate downscaling community than variables such as air temperature and precipitation. However, there is a growing comprehension that wind storms are the single biggest source of ``weather-related'' insurance losses in Europe and North America in the contemporary climate, and that possible changes in wind regimes and intense wind events as a result of global climate non-stationarity are of importance to a variety of potential climate change feedbacks (e.g., emission of sea spray into the atmosphere), ecological impacts (such as wind throw of trees), and a number of other socioeconomic sectors (e.g., transportation infrastructure and operation, electricity generation and distribution, and structural design codes for buildings). There are a number of specific challenges inherent in downscaling wind including, but not limited to, the fact that it has both magnitude (wind speed) and orientation (wind direction). Further, for most applications, it is necessary to accurately downscale the full probability distribution of values at short timescales (e.g., hourly), including extremes, while the mean wind speed averaged over a month or year is of little utility. Dynamical, statistical, and hybrid approaches have been developed to downscale different aspects of the wind climate, but have large uncertainties in terms of high-impact aspects of the wind (e.g., extreme wind speeds and gusts). The wind energy industry is a key application for right-scaled wind parameters and has been a major driver of new techniques to increase fidelity. Many opportunities remain to refine existing downscaling methods, to develop new approaches to improve the skill with which the spatiotemporal scales of wind variability are represented, and for new approaches to evaluate skill in the context of wind climates.},

These methods are used to perform disaggregation of daily rainfall to hourly rainfall at four point locations across Australia (Sydney, Perth, Cairns, and Hobart), which are associated with different climatic regimes. The methods are evaluated based on parameter estimation procedures applied (including introduction of the sequential Monte Carlo sampler in RBLM), the capability of the resulting sequences to reproduce standard validation statistics, and the representation of observed rainfall variability and intermittency, within-day wet spells, and extreme rainfall percentiles. The results generally indicate that the method of fragments outperforms the other models. While all the models are found to simulate reasonably well the commonly used statistical measures (e.g. mean and dry proportions) of rainfall at the hourly timestep, the microcanonical model is found to significantly overestimate the hourly rainfall variance. With respect to extreme value characteristics, the resampling approach is found to match well the observed intensity{\textendash}frequency relationship at an hourly scale, with the cascade models underestimating (canonical) and overestimating (microcanonical) extreme rainfall. The point process model's performance is poor in Cairns but reasonably good at other locations. An analysis of the empirical within-day wet- and dry-spell distributions further reveals that the cascade-based models are not robust for observed wet and dry spells.},

  abstract = {Quantitative geomorphic research depends on accurate topographic data often collected via remote sensing. Lidar, and photogrammetric methods like structure-from-motion, provide the highest quality data for generating digital elevation models (DEMs). Unfortunately, these data are restricted to relatively small areas, and may be expensive or time-consuming to collect. Global and near-global DEMs with 1 arcsec ({$\sim$}30 m) ground sampling from spaceborne radar and optical sensors offer an alternative gridded, continuous surface at the cost of resolution and accuracy. Accuracy is typically defined with respect to external datasets, often, but not always, in the form of point or profile measurements from sources like differential Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), spaceborne lidar (e.g., ICESat), and other geodetic measurements. Vertical point or profile accuracy metrics can miss the pixel-to-pixel variability (sometimes called DEM noise) that is unrelated to true topographic signal, but rather sensor-, orbital-, and/or processing-related artifacts. This is most concerning in selecting a DEM for geomorphic analysis, as this variability can affect derivatives of elevation (e.g., slope and curvature) and impact flow routing. We use (near) global DEMs at 1 arcsec resolution (SRTM, ASTER, ALOS, TanDEM-X, and the recently released Copernicus) and develop new internal accuracy metrics to assess inter-pixel variability without reference data. Our study area is in the arid, steep Central Andes, and is nearly vegetation-free, creating ideal conditions for remote sensing of the bare-earth surface. We use a novel hillshade-filtering approach to detrend longwavelength topographic signals and accentuate short-wavelength variability. Fourier transformations of the spatial signal to the frequency domain allows us to quantify: 1) artifacts in the un-projected 1 arcsec DEMs at wavelengths greater than the Nyquist (twice the nominal resolution, so {$>$} 2 arcsec); and 2) the relative variance of adjacent pixels in DEMs resampled to 30-m resolution (UTM projected). We translate results into their impact on hillslope and channel slope calculations, and we highlight the quality of the five DEMs. We find that the Copernicus DEM, which is based on a carefully edited commercial version of the TanDEM-X, provides the highest quality landscape representation, and should become the preferred DEM for topographic analysis in areas without sufficient coverage of higher-quality local DEMs.},

Change detection (CD) or time-series data analysis in 3D has gained great attention due to its capability of providing volumetric dynamics to facilitate more applications and provide more accurate results. The state-of-the-art CD reviews aim to provide a comprehensive synthesis and to simplify the taxonomy of the traditional remote sensing CD techniques, which mainly sit within the boundary of 2D image/spectrum analysis, largely ignoring the particularities of 3D aspects of the data. The inclusion of 3D data for change detection (termed 3D CD), not only provides a source with different modality for analysis, but also transcends the border of traditional top-view 2D pixel/object-based analysis to highly detailed, oblique view or voxel-based geometric analysis. This paper reviews the recent developments and applications of 3D CD using remote sensing and close-range data, in support of both academia and industry researchers who seek for solutions in detecting and analyzing 3D dynamics of various objects of interest. We first describe the general considerations of 3D CD problems in different processing stages and identify CD types based on the information used, being the geometric comparison and geometric-spectral analysis. We then summarize relevant works and practices in urban, environment, ecology and civil applications, etc. Given the broad spectrum of applications and different types of 3D data, we discuss important issues in 3D CD methods. Finally, we present concluding remarks in algorithmic aspects of 3D CD.},

Here, we analyse global patterns of snowmelt and agricultural water uses to identify regions and crops that are most dependent on snowmelt water resources. We find hotspots primarily in high-mountain Asia (the Tibetan Plateau), Central Asia, western Russia, western US and the southern Andes. Using projections of sub-annual runoff under warming scenarios, we identify the basins most at risk from changing snowmelt patterns, where up to 40\% of irrigation demand must be met by new alternative water supplies under a 4\,{$^\circ$}C warming scenario. Our results highlight basins and crops where adaptation of water management and agricultural systems may be especially critical in a changing climate.},

While mean daily snowfall decreases, both the 99th and the 99.9th percentiles of daily snowfall increase in many regions in the next decades, especially for Northern America and Asia. Additionally, the average intensity of snowfall events exceeding these percentiles as experienced historically increases in many regions. This is likely to pose a challenge to municipalities in mid to high latitudes. Overall, extreme snowfall events are likely to become an increasingly important impact of climate change in the next decades, even if they will become rarer, but not necessarily less intense, in the second half of the century.},

  abstract = {One of the major obstacles for designing solutions against the imminent climate crisis is the scarcity of high spatio-temporal resolution model projections for variables such as precipitation. This kind of information is crucial for impact studies in fields like hydrology, agronomy, ecology, and risk management. The currently highest spatial resolution datasets on a daily scale for projected conditions fail to represent complex local variability. We used deep-learning-based statistical downscaling methods to obtain daily 1 km resolution gridded data for precipitation in the Eastern Ore Mountains in Saxony, Germany. We built upon the well-established climate4R framework, while adding modifications to its base-code, and introducing skip connections-based deep learning architectures, such as U-Net and U-Net++. We also aimed to address the known general reproducibility issues by creating a containerized environment with multi-GPU (graphic processing unit) and TensorFlow's deterministic operations support. The perfect prognosis approach was applied using the ERA5 reanalysis and the ReKIS (Regional Climate Information System for Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia) dataset. The results were validated with the robust VALUE framework. The introduced architectures show a clear performance improvement when compared to previous statistical downscaling benchmarks. The best performing architecture had a small increase in total number of parameters, in contrast with the benchmark, and a training time of less than 6 min with one NVIDIA A-100 GPU. Characteristics of the deep learning models configurations that promote their suitability for this specific task were identified, tested, and argued. Full model repeatability was achieved employing the same physical GPU, which is key to build trust in deep learning applications. The EURO-CORDEX dataset is meant to be coupled with the trained models to generate a high-resolution ensemble, which can serve as input to multi-purpose impact models.},

  abstract = {Because the glacier snowline is easy to identify on optical satellite images and because in certain conditions it can be used as an indicator of the equilibrium line, it may be a relevant parameter for the study of the relationships between climate and glaciers. Although several studies have shown that the snowline altitude (SLA) at the end of the hydrological year is a good indicator of the equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) for mid-latitude glaciers, such a relationship remains conjectural for tropical glaciers. Indeed, unlike in mid-latitudes, tropical climate conditions result in a distinct seasonality of accumulation/ablation processes. We examine this relationship using direct field ELA and mass-balance measurements made on Glaciar Zongo, Bolivia ({\textasciitilde}16{$^\circ$} S), vand Glaciar Artesonraju, Peru ({\textasciitilde}9{$^\circ$} S), and the SLA retrieved from satellite images acquired in the past two decades. We show that on glaciers in the outer tropics: (1) ablation is reduced during the dry season in austral winter (May-August), the SLA does not change much, and satellite images acquired between May and August could be used to compute the SLA; and (2) the highest SLA detected on a number of satellite images acquired during the dry season provides a good estimate of the annual ELA. However, as snowfall events can occur during the dry season, the SLA detected on satellite images tends to underestimate the ELA. Thus, we recommend validating the SLA computed from satellite images with field data collected on a benchmark glacier before measuring the SLA on other glaciers in the same mountain range for which no field data are available. This study is a major step towards extending the measurement of glacier parameters (ELA and mass balance) at the scale of a whole mountain range in the outer tropics to better document the relationships between climate and glaciers.},

  abstract = {The separation of fresh snow, exposed glacier ice and debris covered ice on glacier surfaces is needed for hydrologic applications and for understanding the response of glaciers to climate variability. The end-of-season snowline altitude (SLA) is an indicator of the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of a glacier and is often used to infer the mass balance of a glacier. Regional snowline estimates are generally missing from glacier inventories for remote, high-altitude glacierized areas such as High Mountain Asia. In this study, we present an automated, decision-based image classification algorithm implemented in Python to separate snow, ice and debris surfaces on glaciers and to extract glacier snowlines at monthly and annual time steps and regional scales. The method was applied in the Hunza basin in the Karakoram and the Trishuli basin in eastern Himalaya. We automatically partitioned the various types of surfaces on glaciers at each time step using image band ratios combined with topographic criteria based on two versions of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission elevation dataset. SLAs were extracted on a pixel-by-pixel basis using a ``buffer'' method adapted for each elevation dataset. Over the period studied (2000{\textendash}2016), end-of-the-ablation season annual ELAs fluctuated from 4,917 to 5,336 m a.s.l. for the Hunza, with a 16-year average of 5,177 {$\pm$} 108 m a.s.l., and 5,395{\textendash}5,565 m a.s.l. for the Trishuli, with an average of 5,444 {$\pm$} 63 m a.s.l. Snowlines were sensitive to the manual corrections of the partition, the topographic slope, the elevation dataset and the band ratio thresholds particularly during the spring and winter months, and were not sensitive to the size of the buffer used to extract the snowlines. With further refinement and calibration with field measurements, this method can be easily applied to higher resolution Sentinel-2 data (5 days temporal resolution) as well as daily PlanetScope to derive sub-monthly snowlines.},

It is extremely recommended for LULC studies related to evaluating the sustainability of changing areas over time. The agricultural sector in Egypt is one of the crucial pillars of the national economy. The amount of traditional agricultural land (Old Lands) in the Nile Delta had a significant decline over the past few decades due to urban encroachment. Consequently, several land reclamation initiatives and policies have been adopted by the Egyptian government to expand agricultural land in desert areas (New Lands) adjacent to both fringes of the Nile delta. Tiba district is one of those newly reclaimed areas located in the western Nile Delta of Egypt with a total area of 125 km2. The primary objective of this article was to identify, monitor and quantify historical LULC changes in Tiba district using historical multi-temporal Landsat imageries for six different dates acquired from 1988 to 2018. The temporal and historical changes that occurred were identified using supervised maximum likelihood classification (MLC) approach. Three major LULC classes were distinguished and mapped: (1) Agricultural land; (2) barren land; and (3) urban land. In 1988, Tiba district was 100\% barren land; however, during the 1990s, the governmental reclamation projects have led to significant changes in LULC. The produced LULC maps from performing the MLC demonstrated that Tiba district had experienced significant agricultural land expansion from 0\% in 1988 to occupy 84\% in 2018, whilst, barren land area has decreased from 100\% in 1988 to occupy only 7\% in 2018. This reflects the successful governmental initiatives for agricultural expansion in desert areas located in the western Nile Delta of Egypt.},

  abstract = {Physically based models provide insights into key hydrologic processes but are associated with uncertainties due to deficiencies in forcing data, model parameters, and model structure. Forcing uncertainty is enhanced in snow-affected catchments, where weather stations are scarce and prone to measurement errors, and meteorological variables exhibit high variability. Hence, there is limited understanding of how forcing error characteristics affect simulations of cold region hydrology and which error characteristics are most important. Here we employ global sensitivity analysis to explore how (1) different error types (i.e., bias, random errors), (2) different error probability distributions, and (3) different error magnitudes influence physically based simulations of four snow variables (snow water equivalent, ablation rates, snow disappearance, and sublimation). We use the Sobol' global sensitivity analysis, which is typically used for model parameters but adapted here for testing model sensitivity to coexisting errors in all forcings. We quantify the Utah Energy Balance model's sensitivity to forcing errors with 1 840 000 Monte Carlo simulations across four sites and five different scenarios. Model outputs were (1) consistently more sensitive to forcing biases than random errors, (2) generally less sensitive to forcing error distributions, and (3) critically sensitive to different forcings depending on the relative magnitude of errors. For typical error magnitudes found in areas with drifting snow, precipitation bias was the most important factor for snow water equivalent, ablation rates, and snow disappearance timing, but other forcings had a more dominant impact when precipitation uncertainty was due solely to gauge undercatch. Additionally, the relative importance of forcing errors depended on the model output of interest. Sensitivity analysis can reveal which forcing error characteristics matter most for hydrologic modeling.},

Such data provide an opportunity to apply advanced model building techniques to derive high resolution velocity models. As offsets increase the risk increases of cycle skipping and other instabilities being introduced into the model. Here, an iterative diving-wave full waveform inversion (DWFWI) workflow is used to provide stable, detailed model updates for OBN data. The technique is demonstrated on long offset OBN data from the Utsira High in the North Sea. We show that by making use of long offsets we can resolve the velocity model using DWFWI with confidence in the frequency range of 2-8 Hz. The process of progressively increasing the offset in DWFWI allows stable velocity model updates and can model sand injectites, shallow gas anomalies and deep geological structures. The model is then updated with multiazimuth tomography.},

  abstract = {The gap in resolution between existing global climate model output and that sought by decision-makers drives an ongoing need for climate downscaling. Here we test the extent to which developments in deep learning can out-perform existing statistical approaches for downscaling historical rainfall in the highly complex terrain setting of New Zealand. While deep learning removes the need for manual feature selection when extracting spatial-temporal information from predictor fields, several key considerations need to be addressed. These include: the chosen complexity of the network architecture, suitable loss functions tailored to the problem, as well as input data considerations of domain size and amount of training data required to provide adequate out-of-sample generalization. Sensitivity testing to these considerations reveals that a relatively simple convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with carefully selected loss functions can considerably outperform existing statistical downscaling models based on multiple linear regression with manual feature selection. When aggregated across the entire region, the fraction of explained variance on wet days increased from 0.35 to 0.52, the root-mean-squared error reduced by over 20\% and percentage biases for the 90th percentile of rainfall improved by over 25\%. Using interpretable machine learning methods, we demonstrate that the CNN has been capable of self-learning physically plausible relationships between the large-scale atmospheric environment and extreme localized rainfall events. The historical performance and physical interpretability documented here lends support for wider development and application of deep learning in climate downscaling.},

We compared the observed Arctic amplification ratio with the ratio simulated by state-of-the-art climate models, and found that the observed four-fold warming ratio over 1979{\textendash}2021 is an extremely rare occasion in the climate model simulations. The observed and simulated amplification ratios are more consistent with each other if calculated over a longer period; however the comparison is obscured by observational uncertainties before 1979. Our results indicate that the recent four-fold Arctic warming ratio is either an extremely unlikely event, or the climate models systematically tend to underestimate the amplification.},

  abstract = {Multiple Additive Regression Trees (MART), an ensemble model of boosted regression trees, is known to deliver high prediction accuracy for diverse tasks, and it is widely used in practice. However, it suffers an issue which we call over-specialization, wherein trees added at later iterations tend to impact the prediction of only a few instances, and make negligible contribution towards the remaining instances. This negatively affects the performance of the model on unseen data, and also makes the model over-sensitive to the contributions of the few, initially added tress. We show that the commonly used tool to address this issue, that of shrinkage, alleviates the problem only to a certain extent and the fundamental issue of over-specialization still remains. In this work, we explore a different approach to address the problem that of employing dropouts, a tool that has been recently proposed in the context of learning deep neural networks. We propose a novel way of employing dropouts in MART, resulting in the DART algorithm. We evaluate DART on ranking, regression and classification tasks, using large scale, publicly available datasets, and show that DART outperforms MART in each of the tasks, with a significant margin. We also show that DART overcomes the issue of over-specialization to a considerable extent.},

Cloud-resolving models better represent many of these processes and can now be run globally but only for short-term simulations of at most a few years because of computational limitations. Here we demonstrate that deep learning can be used to capture many advantages of cloud-resolving modeling at a fraction of the computational cost. We train a deep neural network to represent all atmospheric subgrid processes in a climate model by learning from a multiscale model in which convection is treated explicitly. The trained neural network then replaces the traditional subgrid parameterizations in a global general circulation model in which it freely interacts with the resolved dynamics and the surface-flux scheme. The prognostic multiyear simulations are stable and closely reproduce not only the mean climate of the cloud-resolving simulation but also key aspects of variability, including precipitation extremes and the equatorial wave spectrum. Furthermore, the neural network approximately conserves energy despite not being explicitly instructed to. Finally, we show that the neural network parameterization generalizes to new surface forcing patterns but struggles to cope with temperatures far outside its training manifold. Our results show the feasibility of using deep learning for climate model parameterization. In a broader context, we anticipate that data-driven Earth system model development could play a key role in reducing climate prediction uncertainty in the coming decade.},

Most are written in efficient programming languages such as Fortran or C, but often require additional code efforts to plug in to more user-friendly data analysis and/or visualization tools to ease interpretation and scientific insight. In this paper, we present an effort to port a common core of accepted physical principles governing landscape evolution directly into a high-level language and data analysis environment such as Matlab. SIGNUM (acronym for Simple Integrated Geomorphological Numerical Model) is an independent and self-contained Matlab, TIN-based landscape evolution model, built to simulate topography development at various space and time scales. SIGNUM is presently capable of simulating hillslope processes such as linear and nonlinear diffusion, fluvial incision into bedrock, spatially varying surface uplift which can be used to simulate changes in base level, thrust and faulting, as well as effects of climate changes. Although based on accepted and well-known processes and algorithms in its present version, it is built with a modular structure, which allows to easily modify and upgrade the simulated physical processes to suite virtually any user needs. The code is conceived as an open-source project, and is thus an ideal tool for both research and didactic purposes, thanks to the high-level nature of the Matlab environment and its popularity among the scientific community. In this paper the simulation code is presented together with some simple examples of surface evolution, and guidelines for development of new modules and algorithms are proposed.},

Our results indicate that a larger system of ice-dammed lakes existed in this region than previously thought. The lakes were dammed between the main water divide to the west and the retreating ice sheet margin to the east. The shorelines dip towards the northwest with gradients ranging from 0.5 to 0.4\,m/km, from the oldest to the youngest. Further, we have compiled Lateglacial and Holocene shoreline data along the Norwegian coast and from within the Baltic Sea basin and reconstructed the isostatic uplift along a 1400\,km long northwest-southeast transect from the Norwegian Sea to Lake Ladoga. By comparing the measured ice-dammed lake shoreline gradients to the dated marine shorelines, we infer that the lakes may have existed for several centuries following 10.2\,cal ka BP. We also describe large deposits and extensive erosive features, which demonstrate that a catastrophic glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) took place eastward along the Pite River Valley. Based on cross-cutting relations to raised shorelines developed in the early Holocene Ancylus Lake (Baltic Sea basin) we conclude that the flood and thus the final phase of deglaciation took place within the time interval 10.3{\textendash}9.9\,cal ka BP.},

  abstract = {Understanding past responses of ice sheets to climate change provides an important long-term context for observations of present day, and projected future, ice-sheet change. In this work, we reconstruct the deglaciation of the marine-terminating western margin of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet in the outer Hardangerfjorden area of southwestern Norway, following the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) until the start of the Holocene. We base our interpretations on a combination of geomorphological mapping using high-resolution (LiDAR) terrain models, 68 new cosmogenic nuclide 10Be exposure ages and radiocarbon-dated lake sediment cores, supported by the stratigraphic position of the 12.1\,ka Vedde Ash. We show that even the highest mountain summits in the area ({\textasciitilde}1200{\textendash}1400\,m a.s.l.) were ice-covered during the LGM, thus settling debates concerning the Scandinavian Ice Sheet thickness in this region. These summits emerged as nunataqs through the ice sheet about 22{\textendash}18\,ka, potentially owing to upstream ice thinning caused by the break-up and retreat of the Norwegian Channel Ice Stream. Following the break-up of the Norwegian Channel Ice Stream, the ice margin seemingly stabilized at the outermost coast for 3500{\textendash}5500\,years before the mouth of Hardangerfjorden became ice free at c. 14.5\,ka. Subsequently, during the B{\o}lling and Aller{\o}d periods, the ice sheet retreated rapidly into the inner parts of Hardangerfjorden before a major ice sheet re-advance during the Younger Dryas. We identify and reconstruct a sizeable, independent ice cap on the Ulvanosa mountain massif during the Younger Dryas (YD), a massif that earlier was mapped as covered by the Scandinavian Ice Sheet during the YD. We also document ice-free areas that are more extensive than previously thought between Hardangerfjorden and Matersfjorden during the YD.},

BC and dust also advanced by 10-15 days the peak melt water runoff, a substantial effect on the timing of water resources availability. We also demonstrate that the decrease in BC deposition since the 1980s moderates the impact of current warming on snow cover decline. Hence, accounting for changes in light-absorbing particles deposition is required to improve the accuracy of snow cover reanalyses and climate projections, that are crucial for better understanding the past and future evolution of mountain social-ecological systems.},

  abstract = {In this study we analyzed the relations between terrain characteristics and snow depth distribution in a small alpine catchment located in the central Spanish Pyrenees. Twelve field campaigns were conducted during 2012 and 2013, which were years characterized by very different climatic conditions. Snow depth was measured using a long range terrestrial laser scanner and analyses were performed at a spatial resolution of 5 m. Pearson's r correlation, multiple linear regressions (MLRs) and binary regression trees (BRTs) were used to analyze the influence of topography on the snow depth distribution. The analyses were used to identify the topographic variables that best explain the snow distribution in this catchment, and to assess whether their contributions were variable over intra- and interannual timescales. The topographic position index (index that compares the relative elevation of each cell in a digital elevation model to the mean elevation of a specified neighborhood around that cell with a specific shape and searching distance), which has rarely been used in these types of studies, most accurately explained the distribution of snow. The good capability of the topographic position index (TPI) to predict snow distribution has been observed in both, MLRs and BRTs for all analyzed days. Other variables affecting the snow depth distribution included the maximum upwind slope, elevation and northing. The models developed to predict snow distribution in the basin for each of the 12 survey days were similar in terms of the explanatory variables. However, the variance explained by the overall model and by each topographic variable, especially those making a lesser contribution, differed markedly between a year in which snow was abundant (2013) and a year when snow was scarce (2012), and also differed between surveys in which snow accumulation or melting conditions dominated in the preceding days. The total variance explained by the models clearly decreased for those days on which the snowpack was thinner and more patchily. Despite the differences in climatic conditions in the 2012 and 2013 snow seasons, similarities in snow distributions patterns were observed which are directly related to terrain topographic characteristics.},

  abstract = {The small scale distribution of the snowpack in mountain areas is highly heterogeneous, and is mainly controlled by the interactions between the atmosphere and local topography. However, the influence of different terrain features in controlling variations in the snow distribution depends on the characteristics of the study area. As this leads to uncertainties in high spatial resolution snowpack simulations, a deeper understanding of the role of terrain features on the small scale distribution of snow depth is required. This study applied random forest algorithms to investigate the temporal evolution of snow depth in complex alpine terrain using as predictors various topographical variables and in situ snow depth observations at a single location. The high spatial resolution (1 m x 1 m) snow depth distribution database used in training and evaluating the random forests was derived from terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) devices at three study sites, in the French Alps (2 sites) and the Spanish Pyrenees (1 site). The results show the major importance of two topographic variables, the topographic position index and the maximum upwind slope parameter. For these variables the search distances and directions depended on the characteristics of each site and the TLS acquisition date, but are consistent across sites and are tightly related to main wind directions. The weight of the different topographic variables on explaining snow distribution evolves while major snow accumulation events still take place and minor changes are observed after reaching the annual snow accumulation peak. Random forests have demonstrated good performance when predicting snow distribution for the sites included in the training set with R2 values ranging from 0.82 to 0.94 and mean absolute errors always below 0.4 m. Oppositely, this algorithm failed when used to predict snow distribution for sites not included in the training set, with mean absolute errors above 0.8 m.},

Anthropogenic climate change has reduced mountain snowpacks worldwide, altering snowmelt magnitude and timing. Here the global warming level leading to widespread and persistent mountain snowpack decline, termed low-to-no snow, is estimated for the world's most latitudinally contiguous mountain range, the American Cordillera. We show that a combination of dynamical, thermodynamical and hypsometric factors results in an asymmetric emergence of low-to-no-snow conditions within the midlatitudes of the American Cordillera. Low-to-no-snow emergence occurs approximately 20 years earlier in the southern hemisphere, at a third of the local warming level, and coincides with runoff efficiency declines (8\% average) in both dry and wet years. The prevention of a low-to-no-snow future in either hemisphere requires the level of global warming to be held to, at most, +2.5\,{$^\circ$}C.},

It is not clear what role the Antarctic cryosphere plays in this regard, but new remote-sensing-based techniques and datasets have recently opened the possibility to investigate its role. Here, we leverage these to show that the surface albedo reductions from sustained post-2000 losses in Arctic snow and ice cover equate to increasingly positive snow and ice albedo feedback relative to a 1982{\textendash}1991 baseline period, with a decadal trend of +0.08\,{$\pm$}\,0.04\,W\,m{\textendash}2\,decade{\textendash}1 between 1992 and 2015. During the same period, the expansion of the Antarctic sea-ice pack generated a negative feedback, with a decadal trend of -0.06\,{$\pm$}\,0.02\,W\,m{\textendash}2\,decade{\textendash}1. However, substantial Antarctic sea-ice losses during 2016{\textendash}2018 completely reversed the trend, increasing the three-year mean combined Arctic and Antarctic snow and ice albedo feedback to +0.26\,{$\pm$}\,0.15\,W\,m{\textendash}2. This reversal highlights the importance of Antarctic sea-ice loss to the global snow and ice albedo feedback. The 1992{\textendash}2018 mean feedback is equivalent to approximately 10\% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions over the same period; the share may rise markedly should 2016{\textendash}2018 snow and ice conditions become common, although increasing long-wave emissions will probably mediate the impact on the total radiative-energy budget.},

  abstract = {Extreme precipitation events are a major cause of economic damage and disruption, and need to be addressed for increasing resilience to a changing climate, particularly at the local scale. Practitioners typically want to understand local changes at spatial scales much smaller than the native resolution of most Global Climate Models, for which downscaling techniques are used to translate planetary-to-regional scale change information to local scales. However, users of statistically downscaled outputs should be aware that how the observational data used to train the statistical models is constructed determines key properties of the downscaled solutions. Specifically for one such downscaling approach, when considering seasonal return values of extreme daily precipitation, we find that the Localized Constructed Analogs (LOCA) method produces a significant low bias in return values due to choices made in building the observational data set used to train LOCA. The LOCA low biases in daily extremes are consistent across event extremity, but do not degrade the overall performance of LOCA-derived changes in extreme daily precipitation. We show that the low (negative) bias in daily extremes is a function of a time-of-day adjustment applied to the training data and the manner of gridding daily precipitation data. The effects of these choices are likely to affect other downscaling methods trained with observations made in the same way. The results developed here show that efforts to improve resilience at the local level using extreme precipitation projections can benefit from using products specifically created to properly capture the statistics of extreme daily precipitation events.},

To determine if such differences are real or methodological, there is a need to improve uncertainty estimates in both methods. In this paper, we focus on the uncertainty of geodetic methods and describe a geostatistical technique that takes into account the spatial correlation of the elevation differences when calculating spatially averaged elevation changes. We apply this method to the western Svartisen ice cap, Norway, using elevation differences from the surrounding bedrock derived from stereophotogrammetry. We show that the uncertainty is not only dependent on the standard error of the individual elevation differences but is also dependent on the size of the averaging area and the scale of the spatial correlation. To assess if the geostatistical analysis made over bedrock is applicable to glacier surfaces, we use concurrent photogrammetrical and laser scanning data from bedrock and a range of glacier surfaces to evaluate the dependency of the geostatistical analysis on the surface type. The estimated geodetic mass balance, and its uncertainty, is -2.6 {$\pm$} 0.9 m w.e. for the period 1968{\textendash}85, and -2.0 {$\pm$} 2.2 m w.e. for 1985{\textendash}2002.},

  abstract = {Small-scale heterogeneities within the seafloor such as glacial boulders, concretions, or unexploded ordnance are of major scientific and economic interest. Because of their small size, such objects are hardly imageable by conventional seismic methods since they produce only faint diffractions. Despite the growing interest, reliable and efficient object detection methods are still not established. So, a marine acquisition system to image objects in the size range 0.3{\textendash}4.1 m in the near-surface has been designed and workflows have been developed. Source signals with a central frequency of {$\sim$}1,000 Hz are necessary to generate diffractions for the object size range. Performing beam pattern analyses, a rigid tow frame with the dimensions 8 {\texttimes} 3 m and attached hydrophones was designed. A synthetic aperture approach is realized to improve the resolution. Reflection events are suppressed in Normal-Move-Out corrected shot gathers by the muting of high singular values to enhance the diffractions. The diffractions are imaged with a beamforming algorithm with a high efficiency, as a total swath angle of about 80{$^\circ$} in across-track direction is covered. The processing of synthetic data sets allows an optimization and validation of the workflow and sensitivity analyses. Ground truthing is achieved with 1{\textendash}2 m large boulders on the seafloor in 22 m depth, which were identified in a Multi-Beam Echo Sounder data set. Although diffractions are only weak events in seismic data sets, 3D object detection with seismic beamforming has been found to be an efficient and reliable method to perform derisking for offshore infrastructure installations, drillings, or geologic interpretation.},

  abstract = {The backscattering behaviour of snow cover and of glaciers was investigated based on 21 ERS-1 SAR scenes of the Alps of Tyrol, Austria, which were acquired between April 1992 and July 1993. Comparative field measurements on physical properties of the snow cover, of glacier ice, and of snow-free surfaces were carried out in two test sites: the test site Innsbruck-Leutasch in Alpine valleys at low and medium elevations, and the high alpine test site Otztal which is partly covered by glaciers. Large annual amplitudes of backscattering intensities were observed in the fim areas of glaciers. In ice-free areas, dry snow shows similar backscattering coefficients as snow-free surfaces, whereas backscattering is clearly reduced for wet snow. A procedure was developed for mapping the extent of melting snow in mountain areas based on multi-temporal ERS-1 SAR data. Processing steps include image geocoding, low pass filtering, and change detection. As an effective means to reduce the loss of information due to layover, geocoded images from ascending and descending passes were combined for generating snow maps.},

  abstract = {The Andes span a length of 7000\&thinsp;km and are important for sustaining regional water supplies. Snow variability across this region has not been studied in detail due to sparse and unevenly distributed instrumental climate data. We calculated snow persistence (SP) as the fraction of time with snow cover for each year between 2000 and 2016 from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensors (500\&thinsp;m, 8-day maximum snow cover extent). This analysis is conducted between 8 and 36{$\circ\&$}thinsp;S due to high frequency of cloud (\&gt;\&thinsp;30\&thinsp;\% of the time) south and north of this range. We ran Mann{\textendash}Kendall and Theil{\textendash}Sens analyses to identify areas with significant changes in SP and snowline (the line at lower elevation where SP\&thinsp;=\&thinsp;20\&thinsp;\%). We evaluated how these trends relate to temperature and precipitation from Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications-2 (MERRA2) and University of Delaware datasets and climate indices as El Ni{\~n}o{\textendash}Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Southern Annular Mode (SAM), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Areas north of 29{$\circ\&$}thinsp;S have limited snow cover, and few trends in snow persistence were detected. A large area (34\&thinsp;370\&thinsp;km2) with persistent snow cover between 29 and 36{$\circ\&$}thinsp;S experienced a significant loss of snow cover (2{\textendash}5 fewer days of snow year-1). Snow loss was more pronounced (62\&thinsp;\% of the area with significant trends) on the east side of the Andes. We also found a significant increase in the elevation of the snowline at 10{\textendash}30\&thinsp;m\&thinsp;year-1 south of 29{\textendash}30{$\circ\&$}thinsp;S. Decreasing SP correlates with decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature, and the magnitudes of these correlations vary with latitude and elevation.

Downscaling models were calibrated over the period 1950{\textendash}1991 and validated over the period 1992{\textendash}2014 for each calendar month, for each station, using 4 machine learning techniques, (1) Genetic Programming (GP), (2) Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), (3) Support Vector Machine (SVM), and (4) Relevance Vector Machine (RVM). It was found that, irrespective of the climate regime and the machine learning technique, downscaling models tend to better simulate the average (compared to other statistics) and under-estimate the standard deviation and the maximum of the observed precipitation. Also, irrespective of the climate regime and the machine learning technique, at the majority of stations downscaling models showed an over-estimating trend of low to mid percentiles (i.e. below the 50th percentile) of precipitation and under-estimating trend of high percentiles of precipitation (i.e. above the 90th percentile). The over-estimating trend of low to mid percentiles of precipitation was more pronounced at stations located in dryer climate, irrespective of the machine learning technique. Based on the results of this investigation the use of RVM or ANN over SVM or GP for developing downscaling models can be recommended for a study such as flood prediction which involves the consideration of high extremes of precipitation. Also, RVM can be recommended over GP, ANN or SVM in developing downscaling models for a study such as drought analysis which involves the consideration of low extremes of precipitation. Furthermore, it was found that irrespective of the climate regime, the SVM and RVM-based precipitation downscaling models showed the best performance with the Polynomial kernel.},

A dynamic method is demonstrated in this paper to improve the registration process of SAR images. At first, smoothing filtering is used for noise reduction based on the gaussian-kernel filter to set aside the pursue-up amplification of noise. Then; area-based matching method, cross-correlation, is used to perform a coarse registration. The output of the coarse registration is directly applied to the regular step gradient descent (RSGD) optimizer as a fine registration process. The performance of the demonstrated method was evaluated via comparison with the commonly used corner detectors (Harris, Minimum Eigenvalues, and FAST). Mean square error (MSE) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) are the main factors for the comparison. The results show that the demonstrated approach preserves the robustness of the registration process and minimizes the image noise.

  abstract = {DEMs can be generated using various techniques such as stereoscopy, clinometric, interferometry, and polarimetry. Stereoscopy and interferometry are the most popular techniques for DEM generation. SAR Interferometry and Radargrammetry play a complementary role to each other. For highly vegetated areas such as dense forests, the interferometric DEMs generated using shortwavelength temporal SAR data sets, fail to give good elevation accuracy due to the lack of coherence. On the other hand, the radargrammetric approach may be used to generate DEMs with acceptable elevation accuracy in such areas. In this study, a radargrammetric DEM is generated using RISAT-1 (C-band) SAR stereo pair for the highly vegetated Himalayan mountainous terrain of Uttrakhand state, India. ICESat-2 laser altimetric points were used to assess the elevation accuracies of openly accessible DEMs, such as TanDEM-X, SRTM, ASTER, ALOS PALSAR, and CartoDEM. The comparison between the elevation profiles of generated radargrammetric DEM and openly accessible DEM (found with the highest elevation accuracy), was performed. The elevation accuracy of generated radargrammetric DEM over different geolocations has been assessed in terms of RMSE by using ICESat-2 laser altimetric points and GCPs. Comparing the elevation values of generated radargrammetric DEM and GCPs, an RMSE value of 8.14 m was achieved.},

  abstract = {Daily maps of snow conditions have been produced in Norway with the seNorge snow model since 2004. The seNorge snow model operates with 1 {\texttimes} 1 km resolution, uses gridded observations of daily temperature and precipitation as its input forcing, and simulates, among others, snow water equivalent (SWE), snow depth (SD), and the snow bulk density (\&rho;). In this paper the set of equations contained in the seNorge model code is described and a thorough spatiotemporal statistical evaluation of the model performance from 1957{\textendash}2011 is made using the two major sets of extensive in situ snow measurements that exist for Norway. The evaluation results show that the seNorge model generally overestimates both SWE and \&rho;, and that the overestimation of SWE increases with elevation throughout the snow season. However, the R2-values for model fit are 0.60 for (log-transformed) SWE and 0.45 for \&rho;, indicating that after removal of the detected systematic model biases (e.g. by recalibrating the model or expressing snow conditions in relative units) the model performs rather well. The seNorge model provides a relatively simple, not very data-demanding, yet nonetheless process-based method to construct snow maps of high spatiotemporal resolution. It is an especially well suited alternative for operational snow mapping in regions with rugged topography and large spatiotemporal variability in snow conditions, as is the case in the mountainous Norway.},

Consistent, long time series of these elevation changes are of great scientific value. Here, we present a newly-developed data product of 25 years of elevation changes of the Greenland Ice Sheet, derived from satellite radar altimetry. The data product is made publicly available within the Greenland Ice Sheets project as part of the ESA Climate Change Initiative programme. Analyzing repeated elevation measurements from radar altimetry is widely used for monitoring changes of ice-covered regions. The Greenland Ice Sheet has been mapped by conventional radar altimetry since the launch of ERS-1 in 1991, which was followed by ERS-2, Envisat and currently CryoSat-2. The recently launched Sentinel-3A will provide a continuation of the radar altimetry time series. Since 2010, CryoSat-2 has for the first time measured the changes in the coastal regions of the ice sheet with radar altimetry, with its novel SAR Interferometric (SARIn) mode, which provides improved measurement over regions with steep slopes. Here, we apply a mission-specific combination of cross-over, along-track and plane-fit elevation change algorithms to radar data from the ERS-1, ERS-2, Envisat and CryoSat-2 radar missions, resulting in 25 years of nearly continuous elevation change estimates (1992{\textendash}2016) of the Greenland Ice Sheet. This analysis has been made possible through the recent reprocessing in the REAPER project, of data from the ERS-1 and ERS-2 radar missions, making them consistent with Envisat data. The 25 years of elevation changes are evaluated as 5-year running means, shifted almost continuously by one year. A clear acceleration in thinning is evident in the 5-year maps of elevation following 2003, while only small elevation changes observed in the maps from the 1990s.},

For evaluation of historical simulations of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) ensemble, we used two reanalysis products, one satellite-observed product and an ensemble of different datasets. The CMIP5 models tend to significantly underestimate the observed SCE in spring but are in better agreement with observations in autumn; overall, the observed annual SCE cycle is well captured by the CMIP5 ensemble. In contrast, for SWE, the annual cycle is significantly biased, especially over North America, where some models retain snow even in summer, in disagreement with observations. The snow margin position (SMP) in the CMIP5 historical simulations is in better agreement with observations in spring than in autumn, when close agreement across the CMIP5 models is only found in central Siberia. Historical experiments from most CMIP5 models show negative pan-Arctic trends in SCE and SWE. These trends are, however, considerably weaker (and less statistically significant) than those reported from observations. Most CMIP5 models can more accurately capture the trend pattern of SCE than that of SWE, which shows quantitative and qualitative differences with the observed trends over Eurasia. Our results demonstrate the importance of using multiple data sources for the evaluation of snow characteristics in climate models. Further developments should focus on the improvement of both dataset quality and snow representation in climate models, especially ESM-SnowMIP.},

We show its usefulness for global black box optimization when data point evaluations are expensive. Gaussian process regression is used to model the fitness function based on all available observations so far. For each candidate point this model estimates expected Fitness reduction, and yields a novel closed-form expression of expected information gain. A new type of Pareto-front algorithm continually pushes the boundary of candidates not dominated by any other known data according to both criteria, using multi-objective evolutionary search. This makes the exploration-exploitation trade-off explicit, and permits maximally informed data selection. We illustrate the robustness of our approach in a number of experimental scenarios.},

In this paper we present multiple TLS measurements showing the snow depth development for a series of precipitation events. We observe that the pattern of maximum accumulation is similar for the two years presented here (correlation up to r = 0.97). Storms arriving from the northwest show persistent snow depth distributions and contribute most to the final accumulation pattern. Snow depth patterns of maximum accumulation for the two years are more similar than the distribution created by any two pairs of individual storms. Based on the strong link between accumulation patterns and terrain, we investigated the ability of a model based on terrain and wind direction to predict accumulation patterns. This approach of Winstral et al. (2002), which describes wind exposure and shelter, was able to predict the general accumulation pattern over scales of slopes but failed to match observed variance. Furthermore, a high sensitivity to the local wind direction was demonstrated. We suggest that Winstral et al.'s model could form a useful tool for application from hydrology and avalanche risk assessment to glaciology.},

This may result in degraded and noisy angle gathers unless we properly account for the sampling during processing. We describe a method for making high-quality 3D angle gathers on finely sampled angle grids. We do this by properly band limiting the mapping operator with sinc functions defined in the angle domain. This method allows us to oversample the 3D angle gathers accurately in the angle domain and obtain high-quality results. We demonstrate our method with deepwater Gulf of Mexico node data and show that we can produce high-quality gathers even with 800 m node spacing. The angle gathers derived from these wider node data preserve residual moveout and therefore are suitable for model building. Our results add confidence that data acquired with nodes spaced farther apart than 400 m can be processed and imaged successfully.},

  abstract = {The earth's surface is characterized by small-scale heterogeneity attributable to variability in land cover, soil characteristics and orography. In atmospheric models, this small-scale variability can be partially accounted for by the so-called mosaic approach, i.e., by computing the land-surface processes on a grid with an explicit higher horizontal resolution than the atmosphere. The mosaic approach does, however, not account for the subgrid-scale variability in the screen-level atmospheric parameters, part of which might be related to land-surface heterogeneity itself. In this study, simulations with the numerical weather prediction model COSMO are shown, employing the mosaic approach together with a spatial disaggregation of the atmospheric forcing by the screen-level variables to the subgrid-scale. The atmospheric model is run with a 2.8~km horizontal grid resolution while the land surface processes are computed on a 400-m horizontal grid. The disaggregation of the driving atmospheric variables at screen-level is achieved by a three-step statistical downscaling with rules learnt from high-resolution fully coupled COSMO simulations, where both, atmosphere and surface, were simulated on a 400-m grid. The steps encompass spline interpolation of the grid scale variables, conditional regression based on the high-resolution runs, and an optional stochastic noise generator which restores the variability of the downscaled variables. Simulations for a number of case studies have been carried out, with or without mosaic surface representation and with or without atmospheric disaggregation, and evaluated with respect to the surface state variables and the turbulent surface exchange fluxes of sensible and latent heat. The results are compared with the high-resolution fully coupled COSMO simulations. The results clearly demonstrate the high importance of accounting for subgrid-scale surface heterogeneity. It is shown that the atmospheric disaggregation leads to clear additional improvements in the structures of the two-dimensional surface state variable fields, but to only marginally impacts on the simulation of the turbulent surface exchange fluxes. A detailed analysis of these results identifies strongly correlated errors in atmospheric and surface variables in the mosaic approach as the main reason for the latter. The effects of these errors largely cancel out in the flux parameterization, and thus explain the comparably good results for the fluxes in the mosaic approach without atmospheric disaggregation despite inferior performance for the surface state variables themselves. Inserting noise in the disaggregation scheme leads to a deterioration of the results.},

  abstract = {Many different scientific and end-user communities across many disciplines and sectors, as well as many government agencies and international aid and development organizations, agree that there is a pressing need for a high-accuracy, open-access global digital elevation model (DEM). Although some notable efforts and negotiations among important players within the private industry, government agencies and international NGOs are already happening, more needs to be done to realize and speed-up progress in creating a high-accuracy, open-access DEM. The purpose of this collection of articles is to raise awareness further by describing the problems with current global DEMs and illustrating best practices as well as upcoming opportunities. In an opening opinion article, Schumann and Bates (2018) lay out the limitations and the requirements for a better global, open-access DEM and present a possible way forward. In a reactive commentary, Winsemius et al. (2019) further argue that for the many applications such a DEM would be game-changing, a DEM itself is not enough and, particularly at the local scale and at the impact-level scale, other properties of the environment besides terrain elevation become important as well. These include details of critical infrastructure such as bridges, culverts and flood defenses. The authors therefore argue that a bottom-up data collection approach at the local community level should complement the global consortium approach suggested by Schumann and Bates (2018) for a better global DEM. In a thorough assessment study, Tavares da Costa et al. (2019) examine the adequacy of ten different free DEMs for watershed studies. They argue that the intrinsic inaccuracies in free DEMs limit progress and knowledge and they demonstrate that while most DEMs generally represent elevation profiles well enough, they do not adequately represent important topographic and geomorphic features and therefore are inadequate for many applications. This of course has practical implications since non-trivial limitations of any particular global DEM currently available may significantly hinder progress in solving a number of environmental and socioeconomic challenges. In a similar study but focusing on coastal areas, Gesch (2018) discusses best practices for elevation-based assessments of sea level rise and coastal exposure risk studies. Using many different low-accuracy global DEMs, but also high-accuracy local DEMs, he demonstrates how accuracy information should be considered in planning and implementation studies. The work shows that current global DEMs are not adequate for high confidence mapping of exposure to fine increments of sea level rise or with shorter planning horizons and thus they should not be used in this way, but they are suitable for general delineation of low elevation coastal zones.

  abstract = {Snow avalanches are a major natural hazard, endangering human life and infrastructure in mountainous areas throughout the world. In many countries with seasonally snow-covered mountains, avalanche-forecasting services reliably warn the public by issuing occurrence probabilities for a certain region. However, at present, a single avalanche event cannot be predicted in time and space. Much about the release process remains unknown, mainly because of the highly variable, layered character of the snowpack, a highly porous material that exists close to its melting point. The complex interaction between terrain, snowpack, and meteorological conditions leading to avalanche release is commonly described as avalanche formation. It is relevant to hazard mapping and essential to short-term forecasting, which involves weighting many contributory factors. Alternatively, the release process can be studied and modeled. This approach relies heavily on snow mechanics and snow properties, including texture. While the effect of meteorological conditions or changes on the deformational behavior of snow is known in qualitative or semiquantitative manner, the knowledge of the quantitative relation between snow texture and mechanical properties is limited, but promising developments are under way. Fracture mechanical models have been applied to explain the fracture propagation, and micromechanical models including the two competing processes (damage and sintering) have been applied to explain snow failure. There are knowledge gaps between the sequence of processes that lead to the release of the snow slab: snow deformation and failure, damage accumulation, fracture initiation, and fracture propagation. Simultaneously, the spatial variability that affects damage, fracture initiation, and fracture propagation has to be considered. This review focuses on dry snow slab avalanches and shows that dealing with a highly porous media close to its melting point and processes covering several orders of scale, from the size of a bond between snow grains to the size of a mountain slope, will continue to be very challenging.},

  abstract = {Based on records from the northern North Sea and southern Norway, Quaternary Fennoscandian glaciations are described and discussed. Maximum glaciation, defined as the presence of shelf edge glaciation, an ice stream flowing out of the Norwegian Channel and most likely an ice divide over the central part of Fennoscandia (Sweden, Gulf of Bothnia), occurred for the first time in the late Cenozoic at ca. 1.1myr (the Fedje Glaciation). This glaciation was followed by a ca. 600kyr period with at least two glaciations with ice extension somewhat larger than the Younger Dryas event in the region. The first maximum glaciation of the Bruhnes Chron was during isotope stage 12 and was followed by repeated maximum glaciations within each of the light isotopic stages until stage 2. During the Weichselian, the southwestern part of the Fennoscandian ice sheet reached maximum position three times (sometime between 22 and 28, 37 and 50, and 60 and 80ka). Limited glaciations probably occurred during stadials between the early and middle Weichselian interstadials, between 500ka and 1.1Myr, and most likely also prior to 1.1Myr. Deep Norwegian Sea Ice Rafted Detritus (IRD) records, reflecting contributions from several different ice sheets (Fennoscandian, Barents Sea, Iceland and Greenland), each with large variations in history of ice extent to their respective margins, yet to some degree they reflect the glaciation of the northern North Sea region with an increasing IRD input around 1.1Myr and a relatively low input of North Sea components, during some cycles around the B/M boundary. Maximum glaciations occurred during insolation minima in the earlier part of the Middle Pleistocene, however, not all such minima are reflected by maximum glaciation in southern parts of Fennoscandia. The relatively poor chronological control and non-continuous character of the data on Weichselian interstadials/stadials precludes a clear relationship to atmospheric changes recorded in Greenland ice cores, as well as to precession and/or obliquity cycles in insolation.},

In such periods the Skagerrak Trough (700 m deep) has acted as a confluence area for glacial ice from southeastern Norway, southern Sweden and parts of the Baltic. Possibly related to the threshold in the Norwegian Channel off J{\ae}ren (250 m deep), the ice stream, on a number of occasions over the last 400 ka, inundated the coastal lowlands and left an imprint of NW-oriented ice directional features (drumlins, stone orientations in tills and striations). Marine interstadial sediments found up to 200 m a.s.l. on J{\ae}ren have been suggested to reflect glacial isostasy related to the Norwegian Channel Ice Stream (NCIS). In the channel itself, the ice stream activity is evidenced by mega-scale glacial lineations on till surfaces. As a result of subsidence, the most complete sedimentary records of early phases of the NCIS are preserved close to the continental margin in the North Sea Fan region. The strongest evidence for ice stream erosion during the last glacial phase is found in the Skagerrak. On the continental slope the ice stream activity is evidenced by the large North Sea Fan, which is mainly a result of deposition of glacial-fed debris flows. Northwards of the North Sea Fan, rapid deposition of meltwater plume deposits, possibly related to the NCIS, is detected as far north as the V{\o}ring Plateau. The NCIS system offers a unique possibility to study ice stream related processes and the impact the ice stream development had on open ocean sedimentation and circulation.},

  abstract = {Information from former ice sheets may provide important context for understanding the response of today's ice sheets to forcing mechanisms. Here we present a reconstruction of the last deglaciation of marine sectors of the Eurasian Ice Sheet, emphasising how the retreat of the Norwegian Channel and the Barents Sea ice streams led to separation of the British-Irish and Fennoscandian ice sheets at c. 18.700 and of the Kara-Barents~Sea-Svalbard and Fennoscandian ice sheets between 16.000 and 15.000~years ago. Combined with ice sheet modelling and palaeoceanographic data, our reconstruction shows that the deglaciation, from a peak volume of 20\,m of sea-level rise equivalent, was mainly driven by temperature forced surface mass balance in the south, and by Nordic Seas oceanic conditions in the north. Our results highlight the nonlinearity in the response of an ice sheet to forcing and the significance of ocean-ice-atmosphere dynamics in assessing the fate of contemporary ice sheets.},

The snow depth coefficient of variation (CVds) is a useful metric for characterizing subgrid snow distributions but has not been well defined by a parameterization for mountainous environments. This study utilizes lidar-derived snow depth datasets spanning alpine to sub-alpine mountainous terrain in Colorado, USA to evaluate the variability of subgrid snow distributions within a grid size comparable to a 1000 m resolution common for hydrologic and land surface models. The subgrid CVds exhibited a wide range of variability across the 321 km2 study area (0.15 to 2.74) and was significantly greater in alpine areas compared to subalpine areas. Mean snow depth was the dominant driver of CVds variability in both alpine and subalpine areas, as CVds decreased nonlinearly with increasing snow depths. This negative correlation is attributed to the static size of roughness elements (topography and canopy) that strongly influence seasonal snow variability. Subgrid CVds was also strongly related to topography and forest variables; important drivers of CVds included the subgrid variability of terrain exposure to wind in alpine areas and the mean and variability of forest metrics in subalpine areas. Two statistical models were developed (alpine and subalpine) for predicting subgrid CVds that show reasonable performance statistics. The methodology presented here can be used for characterizing the variability of CVds in snow-dominated mountainous regions, and highlights the utility of using lidar-derived snow datasets for improving model representations of snow processes.},

  abstract = {The geomorphological disposition of (para/peri) glacial landforms, elemental geochemistry, and optical chronology of the relict lake sediment in the Southern Zanskar ranges, northwest Himalaya are used to understand the relationship between glacial dynamics and the lake sedimentation during the mid-Holocene climate variability. Following the Last Glacial Maxima (LGM), pulsating deposition of outwash gravels until the early Holocene overwhelmed the Zanskar valley. The obstruction of Tsarap Chu (chu~=~river) by alluvial fans during the mid-Holocene led to the development of Padum Lake. In the present study, cirque glacier moraines representing three minor glacial advances were mapped along with sedimentological details and dated using Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating technique. The oldest cirque glacier advance - Padum Cirque moraine-3 (PDCm-3) is dated to 11.4~{$\pm~$}0.9~ka. The succeeding advance (PDCm-2) is dated to 5.3~{$\pm~$}0.6 and 4.8~{$\pm~$}0.8~ka whereas, the younger cirque glacier advance (PDCm-1) remains undated. The mid to late Holocene climate variability inferred using major and trace element geochemistry of the relict Padum lake sediments supported by optical chronology indicates six centennial to millennial-scale climatic phases. The prominent warmer phases are represented by decreased mineralogical fine grain flux (low K/Ti, Fe/Si, and Al/Si) with a corresponding increased coarse grain flux (higher Ti/Al and Sr/Al ratios). These phases are dated between 5.9 and 5.5~ka (phase-I), 3.8 and 3.4~ka (phase-IV), and 2.8 and 2.5~ka (phase-VI). The increased mineralogical finer fraction (higher K/Ti, Fe/Si, and Al/Si) between 5.5 and 5.1~ka (phase-II) and 3.4 and 2.8~ka (phase-V) indicate reduced meltwater flux during cooler phases. The intervening phase-III (5.1{\textendash}3.8~ka) is characterized by increased mineralogical coarse grain flux (decreasing K/Ti, Fe/Si, Al/Si) suggesting gradual warming. The oscillatory climate at millennial scale was further used to understand glacier dynamics. The PDCm-2 advance in the lake record corresponds to the first major cooling (5.5 and 5.1~ka; phase-II) and continued until {$\sim$}3.8~ka. Using geochemical data of lake record, a major recession is inferred after 3.8~ka that persisted until around 3.4~ka (phase-IV). Similarly, the undated younger cirque glacier advance (PDCm-1) is assigned to the second cooling event (3.4 and 2.8~ka; phase-V). Thereafter, the cirque glaciers receded, most likely under increasing dryness and fluctuating climate (2.8{\textendash}2.5~ka, phase-VI). After {$\sim$}2.6~ka, the development of ice-wedge pseudomorphs indicates the onset of permafrost conditions that degraded after {$\sim$}2.5~ka implying an increase in air temperature. The lake sedimentation terminates with the deposition of multiple younger alluvial fan facies. The climate variability shows a close correspondence with regional climate records suggesting that marginal glacier advancements were triggered by enhanced moisture via atmospheric rivers and cooler winter temperatures. The study highlights the potential of relict lake sediment in association with para- and peri-glacial landforms to reconstruct the pattern of minor glacier responses to climate variability during the Holocene.},

  abstract = {Subsalt imaging has been a long-term challenge for the oil and gas industry. The substantial progress made in data acquisition and imaging since the late 1990s has made some subsalt imaging problems tractable, but building earth models that enable imaging under complex salt remains a challenge. Labor-intensive workflows remain industry standard practice. Not only are these costly and time consuming, they have also performed poorly in many areas of economic interest. Various automatic model-building tools have been proposed to overcome these disadvantages. One such tool, full-waveform inversion (FWI), has already revolutionized velocity-model building in areas with shallow gas. Prior to 2006, imaging in these areas had been considered challenging and labor intensive, just as imaging under complex salt remains today. Modeling indicates that low frequencies and wide offsets may be the key to success when building velocity models using FWI. Just how low and how wide that may be required for FWI success depends on the particular problem. At the Atlantis Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico we recently acquired wide-offset oceanbottom-node data with conventional airguns. By taking care during the acquisition, we recorded usable signal down to a lower frequency than previously achieved. We then applied FWI to the resulting data set and used the resulting velocity model, unmodified, to reverse time migrate the seismic data. It produced some of the best subsalt images of the Atlantis reservoir structure ever seen. Furthermore, the FWI velocity model revealed several major interpretation errors in the legacy salt model; thus the FWI result also offered an excellent basis for updating the salt model with the conventional workflow. These results demonstrate that with appropriate seismic data to support it, and with due care taken during processing and inversion, FWI truly offers a paradigm shift in model building and imaging in areas of complex salt.},

  abstract = {The spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of snow in Arctic regions have a direct impact on the regional energy balance and hydrologic cycle. However, our knowledge of snow cover in Arctic regions is very limited due to the sparseness of in situ measurements. This study presents a new method to derive snow accumulation information for Arctic regions through tracking the surface elevation changes of numerous frozen arctic lakes measured by Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation satellite (ICESat) repeat altimetry observations. The original ICESat elevation product for continental surface was generated by tracking the centroids of the emitted and the returned laser waveforms. This product contains many biased measurements over frozen arctic lake surfaces due to the scattering effects induced by thin clouds and blowing snow. This study derives an operational approach that produces more reliable altimetry observations by converting the elevation measurements from the centroid scheme to the max-amplitude-peak scheme. Time-variable biases exist between the repeat elevation measurements acquired in different ICESat campaigns. The correction of these inter-campaign biases in this study significantly improves the quantification of the surface elevation change, thus enabling more consistent subsequent snow accumulation estimates. Besides snow fall, lake ice growth also contributes to the surface elevation change. We developed a method to measure and remove this contribution from the total lake surface elevation change, which leads to more accurate estimates of snow accumulation on frozen surfaces of 277 lakes in Arctic regions of northern Alaska. The results were validated using in situ snow depth observations from terrestrial stations on the Arctic coastal plain of Alaska. After the correction of the ICESat inter-campaign biases and the removal of contribution by lake surface phase transformation, the snow accumulation derived from the repeat ICESat elevation measurements are highly correlated with in situ snow depth observations with a Pearson's correlation coefficient r of 0.88. In comparison with ground-based measurements, the root mean square error (RMSE) of our snow accumulation estimates is approximately 5\,cm. Our method makes it possible to provide much denser snow accumulation information as compared to the existing in situ observations for the Circum-Arctic coastal regions and also the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau where seasonal frozen lakes are abundant.},

The results show that the model-free retrackers (e.g., OCOG/Ice-1/Ice) outperform the model-based retrackers for most of the missions, particularly over small lakes. Among the satellite altimetry missions, Sentinel-3 gave the best results, followed by SARAL. ENVISAT has slightly better lake water level estimates than Jason-1 and Jason-2, but its data missing rate is higher. For small lakes, ERS-1 and ERS-2 missions provided more accurate lake water level estimates than the TOPEX/Poseidon mission. In contrast, for large lakes, TOPEX/Poseidon is a better option due to its lower data missing rate and shorter repeat cycle. GeoSat and GeoSat Follow-On (GFO) both have an extremely high data missing rate of lake water level estimates. Although several contemporary radar altimetry missions provide more accurate lake level estimates than GFO, GeoSat was the sole radar altimetry mission, between 1985 and 1990, that provided the lake water level estimates. With a full consideration of the performance and the operational duration, the best strategy for constructing long-term lake water level records should be a two-step bias correction and normalization procedure. In the first step, use Jason-2 as the initial reference to estimate the systematic biases with TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, and Jason-3 and then normalize them to form a consistent TOPEX/Poseidon{\textendash}Jason series. Then, use the TOPEX/Poseidon{\textendash}Jason series as the reference to estimate and remove systematic biases with other radar altimetry missions to construct consistent long-term lake water level series for ungauged lakes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change is decreasing seasonal snowpacks globally, with potentially catastrophic consequences on water resources, given the long-held reliance on snowpack in water management. In this Review, we examine the changes and trickle-down impacts of snow loss in the western United States (WUS). Across the WUS, snow water equivalent declines of {\textasciitilde}25\% are expected by 2050, with losses comparable with contemporary historical trends. There is less consensus on the time horizon of snow disappearance, but model projections combined with a new low-to-no snow definition suggest {\textasciitilde}35{\textendash}60 years before low-to-no snow becomes persistent if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated. Diminished and more ephemeral snowpacks that melt earlier will alter groundwater and streamflow dynamics. The direction of these changes are difficult to constrain given competing factors such as higher evapotranspiration, altered vegetation composition and changes in wildfire behaviour in a warmer world. These changes undermine conventional WUS water management practices, but through proactive implementation of soft and hard adaptation strategies, there is potential to build resilience to extreme, episodic and, eventually, persistent low-to-no snow conditions. Federal investments offer a timely opportunity to address these vulnerabilities, but they require a concerted portfolio of activities that cross historically siloed physical and disciplinary boundaries.},

The diurnal cycle in wind speed has different shapes at different heights and the WRF model can replicate the diurnal cycle at higher levels ({$\sim$} 250 m a.g.l.) but fails to replicate it near surface. We investigate the effect of using different Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) and Surface Layer (SL) schemes and compare stability data between model and observations. The results suggest a weak link between the model's ability to replicate stability, probably linked to incorrect surface roughness length specification, and the model's ability to replicate diurnal cycle at lower levels.},

NASA's current GEDI and ICESat-2 missions as well as the upcoming NISAR mission will collect synergistic data with different coverage and sensitivity to AGB. In this study, we present a multi-sensor data fusion approach leveraging the strength of each mission to produce wall-to-wall AGB maps that are more accurate and spatially comprehensive than what is achievable with any one sensor alone. Specifically, we calibrate a regional L-band radar AGB model using the sparse, simulated spaceborne lidar AGB estimates. We assess our data fusion framework using simulations of GEDI, ICESat-2 and NISAR data from airborne laser scanning (ALS) and UAVSAR data acquired over the temperate high AGB forest and complex terrain in Sonoma County, California, USA. For ICESat-2 and GEDI missions, we simulate two years of data coverage and AGB at footprint level are estimated using realistic AGB models. We compare the performance of our fusion framework when different combinations of the sparse simulated GEDI and ICEsat-2 AGB estimates are used to calibrate our regional L-band AGB models. In addition, we test our framework at Sonoma using (a) 1-ha square grid cells and (b) similarly sized irregularly shaped objects. We demonstrate that the estimated mean AGB across Sonoma is more accurately estimated using our fusion framework than using GEDI or ICESat-2 mission data alone, either with a regular grid or with irregular segments as mapping units. This research highlights methodological op\- portunities for fusing new and upcoming active remote sensing data streams toward improved AGB mapping through data fusion.},

  abstract = {In the mountains of Norway, snow depth (SD) is highly variable due to strong winds and open terrain. To investigate snow conditions on one of Europe's largest mountain plateaus, Hardangervidda, we conducted snow measurement campaigns in spring 2008 and 2009 using airborne lidar scanning at the approximate time of annual snow maximum (mid-April). From 658 empirical distributions of SD at Hardangervidda, each comprised about 4,000 SD values sampled from a grid cell of 0.5 km2, quantitative tests have shown that the gamma distribution is a better fit for SD than the normal and log-normal distributions. When aggregating snow and terrain data from 10 {\texttimes} 10 m to 0.5 km2, we find that the standard deviation of the terrain parameter squared slope, land cover, and the mean SD are highly correlated (0.7, 0.52, and 0.89) to the standard deviation of SD. A model for SD variance is proposed that, in addition to addressing the dependencies between the variability of SD and the terrain characteristics, also takes into account the observed nonlinear relationship between the mean and the standard deviation of SD. When validated against observed SD variance retrieved from the same area, the model explains 81{\textendash}83\% of the observed variance for spatial scales of 0.5 and 5.1 km2, which compares favorably to previous models. The model parameters can be determined from a GIS analysis of a detailed digital terrain and land cover model and will hence not increase the number of calibration parameters when implemented in environmental models.},

Here we measure abundances of cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al in bedrock and transported boulders to unveil the glaciation and erosion history of Dove Bugt, northeast Greenland. In agreement with studies of west Greenland, we find that apparent exposure ages increase with elevation from 9 ka to 13 ka in low-lying valleys to 21 ka to 204 ka on high-elevation, blockfield-covered plateaus. We employ a Markov chain Monte Carlo inversion framework to constrain the probability of various erosion histories, and we quantify the residence time of samples within the upper 2 m of the bedrock subsurface{\textemdash}a measure defined as the cosmogenic nuclide memory. This cosmogenic nuclide memory exceeds 600 ka on the highest plateaus but is limited to less than 500 ka in most other high-elevation samples and to less than 100 ka at low-elevations. Our results define maximum limits for the fraction of ice cover during the past 1 Ma to {$\sim$}70\% on the Store Koldewey peaks and {$\sim$}90\% farther inland at Pusterdal, respectively. Minimum limits to ice cover, however, cannot be reliably constrained by the data. Finally, we propose that limited erosion on the highest plateaus of Store Koldewey since 0.6{\textendash}1.0 Ma indicates a minimum age for fjord-plateau formation within this area of northeast Greenland.},

While previous missions have used infrared lasers to make these measurements, NASA's upcoming ICESat (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite)-2 mission will use a green laser. Because ice absorbs green light very weakly, in the absence of light-absorbing impurities, green photons can scatter off many snow grains before returning to the surface, delaying the return pulse and leading to an apparent downward shift in the snow surface. In this paper, we explore the effects of snow-grain size and impurity content on these measurements, and investigate strategies that might help minimize the biases they introduce. We find that an uninformed choice of measurement parameters (a windowed mean including a large range of photons around the surface) can result in {$>$}0.45\,m of apparent surface-height variation between large and small grain sizes. Other choices of measurement parameters, such as a windowed median, can reduce this uncertainty by a factor of two to three. In addition, measurements of surface reflectance at green and infrared wavelengths, and interpretation of return-pulse shapes may be used to estimate and correct for these biases.},

  abstract = {Rapid adjustments are responses to forcing agents that cause a perturbation to the top of atmosphere energy budget but are uncoupled to changes in surface warming. Different mechanisms are responsible for these adjustments for a variety of climate drivers. These remain to be quantified in detail. It is shown that rapid adjustments reduce the effective radiative forcing (ERF) of black carbon by half of the instantaneous forcing, but for CO2 forcing, rapid adjustments increase ERF. Competing tropospheric adjustments for CO2 forcing are individually significant but sum to zero, such that the ERF equals the stratospherically adjusted radiative forcing, but this is not true for other forcing agents. Additional experiments of increase in the solar constant and increase in CH4 are used to show that a key factor of the rapid adjustment for an individual climate driver is changes in temperature in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Plain Language Summary Long-term global warming can be estimated with knowledge of how climate forcing agents affect the Earth's top-of-atmosphere energy imbalance or effective radiative forcing. Changes in climate forcers, such as greenhouse gases, the Sun's intensity, or emission of aerosol particles, typically impose a direct change in the energy budget, termed an instantaneous radiative forcing. Further to this, a climate forcer may induce changes in the atmosphere, such as a change in thermal structure, clouds, or humidity. These changes themselves, termed rapid adjustments, contribute to the top-of-atmosphere energy budget. Together, the instantaneous radiative forcing plus rapid adjustments equals the effective radiative forcing. We show that for different climate forcing agents, the rapid adjustments behave very differently and are driven by different atmospheric mechanisms. For example, rapid adjustments add to the instantaneous forcing for a carbon dioxide increase, due to a cooling of the stratosphere, but oppose instantaneous forcing for black carbon, driven by a warming troposphere and lowering of cloud height. Understanding rapid adjustments gives a more complete picture of the climate effects of different climate forcers.},

  abstract = {The use of machine learning algorithms frequently involves careful tuning of learning parameters and model hyperparameters. Unfortunately, this tuning is often a ``black art'' requiring expert experience, rules of thumb, or sometimes brute-force search. There is therefore great appeal for automatic approaches that can optimize the performance of any given learning algorithm to the problem at hand. In this work, we consider this problem through the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm's generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). We show that certain choices for the nature of the GP, such as the type of kernel and the treatment of its hyperparameters, can play a crucial role in obtaining a good optimizer that can achieve expert-level performance. We describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning algorithm experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization for many algorithms including Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.},

Associated changes in the cryosphere are the consequence and lead to a demand for monitoring of the glacier changes. This study uses spaceborne laser altimetry data from the ICESat and ICESat-2 missions to obtain ice elevation and mass change rates between 2003{\textendash}2008 and 2019. Elevation changes are derived at orbit crossover locations throughout the study area, and regional volume and mass changes are estimated using a hypsometric approach. A Svalbard-wide annual elevation change rate of -0.30 {$\pm$} 0.15 m yr-1 was found, which corresponds to a mass loss rate of -12.40 {$\pm$} 4.28 Gt yr-1. Compared to the ICESat period (2003{\textendash}2009), thinning has increased over most regions, including the highest negative rates along the west coast and areas bordering the Barents Sea. The overall negative regime is expected to be linked to Arctic warming in the last decades and associated changes in glacier climatic mass balance. Further, observed increased thinning rates and pronounced changes at the eastern side of Svalbard since the ICESat period are found to correlate with atmospheric and oceanic warming in the respective regions.},

  abstract = {The combination of snowfall, snow water equivalent (SWE), and precipitation rate measurements from 39 snow telemetry (SNOTEL) sites in Alaska were used to assess the performance of various precipitation products from satellites, reanalysis, and rain gauges. Observation of precipitation from two water years (2018{\textendash}2019) of a high-resolution radar/rain gauge data (Stage IV) product was also utilized to give insights into the scaling differences between various products. The outcomes were used to assess two popular methods for rain gauge undercatch correction. It was found that SWE and precipitation measurements at SNOTELs, as well as precipitation estimates based on Stage IV data, are generally consistent and can provide a range within which other products can be assessed. The time-series of snowfall and SWE accumulation suggests that most of the products can capture snowfall events; however, differences exist in their accumulation. Reanalysis products tended to overestimate snow accumulation in the study area, while the current combined passive microwave remote sensing products (i.e., IMERG-HQ) underestimate snowfall accumulation. We found that correction factors applied to rain gauges are effective for improving their undercatch, especially for snowfall. However, no improvement in correlation is seen when correction factors are applied, and rainfall is still estimated better than snowfall. Even though IMERG-HQ has less skill for capturing snowfall than rainfall, analysis using Taylor plots showed that the combined microwave product does have skill for capturing the geographical distribution of snowfall and precipitation accumulation; therefore, bias adjustment might lead to reasonable precipitation estimates. This study demonstrates that other snow properties (e.g., SWE accumulation at the SNOTEL sites) can complement precipitation data to estimate snowfall. In the future, gridded SWE and snow depth data from GlobSnow and Sentinel-1 can be used to assess snowfall and its distribution over broader regions.},

The simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) algorithm has recently attracted considerable attention for challenging optimization problems where it is difficult or impossible to directly obtain a gradient of the objective function with respect to the parameters being optimized. SPSA is based on an easily implemented and highly efficient gradient approximation that relies on measurements of the objective function, not on measurements of the gradient of the objective function. The gradient approximation is based on only two function measurements (regardless of the dimension of the gradient vector). This contrasts with standard finite-difference approaches, which require a number of function measurements proportional to the dimension of the gradient vector. This paper presents a simple step-by-step guide to implementation of SPSA in generic optimization problems and offers some practical suggestions for choosing certain algorithm coefficients.},

We introduce an adversarial deep learning approach to super resolve wind velocity and solar irradiance outputs from global climate models to scales sufficient for renewable energy resource assessment. Using adversarial training to improve the physical and perceptual performance of our networks, we demonstrate up to a  50{\texttimes} 50 {\texttimes}  resolution enhancement of wind and solar data. In validation studies, the inferred fields are robust to input noise, possess the correct small-scale properties of atmospheric turbulent flow and solar irradiance, and retain consistency at large scales with coarse data. An additional advantage of our fully convolutional architecture is that it allows for training on small domains and evaluation on arbitrarily-sized inputs, including global scale. We conclude with a super-resolution study of renewable energy resources based on climate scenario data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report.},

  abstract = {In the Arctic, where wind transport of snow is common, the depth and insulative properties of the snow cover can be determined as much by the wind as by spatial variations in precipitation. Where shrubs are more abundant and larger, greater amounts of drifting snow are trapped and suffer less loss due to sublimation. The snow in shrub patches is both thicker and a better thermal insulator per unit thickness than the snow outside of shrub patches. As a consequence, winter soil surface temperatures are substantially higher, a condition that can promote greater winter decomposition and nutrient release, thereby providing a positive feedback that could enhance shrub growth. If the abundance, size, and coverage of arctic shrubs increases in response to climate warming, as is expected, snow-shrub interactions could cause a widespread increase (estimated 10\%-25\%) in the winter snow depth. This would increase spring runoff, winter soil temperatures, and probably winter CO 2 emissions. The balance between these winter effects and changes in the summer energy balance associated with the increase in shrubs probably depends on shrub density, with the threshold for winter snow trapping occurring at lower densities than the threshold for summer effects such as shading. It is suggested that snow-shrub interactions warrant further investigation as a possible factor contributing to the transition of the arctic land surface from moist graminoid tundra to shrub tundra in response to climatic warming.},

Snow has unique optical properties that reduce the amount of light penetrating to the underlying ice and ocean water, while raising the albedo of the ice in a way that retards melting. Seals also rely on snow drifts on the ice for denning purposes, and snow presence and quality affect human travel across the ice. Moreover, the snow significantly modifies the visual and microwave signals of sea ice in remote sensing.

  abstract = {Snow distribution patterns are similar from one year to the next because they are largely controlled by the interaction of topography, vegetation, and consistent synoptic weather patterns. On a yearly basis none of these controls changes radically. As a consequence, deep and shallow areas of snow tend to be fixed in space, producing depth differences that may vary in absolute, but not relative, amounts from year to year. While this fact is widely known, the use of patterns in modeling snow cover distribution is limited. Here, on the basis of a training set of nine annual snow depth surveys from a small tundra basin in Alaska, we identify the climatological snow distribution pattern (CSDP). Using this and a few depth measurements, the snow distribution for years that were not included in the training set is predicted and mapped with a near-zero bias and RMSE that ranged from 4.4 to 10.4 cm. The accuracy of this strictly empirical approach to modeling the depth distribution is similar to, or better than, the output from a weather-driven physically based snow model. However, in our view a hybrid approach is best. Ingesting the CSDP into SnowModel, a widely used numerical code that simulates snow processes, the accuracy of the model output is improved by up to 60\%. This hybrid approach retains the advantages of running a weather-driven numerical code but adds spatial accuracy currently only obtainable from observed snow patterns. The patterns can be captured in several ways, including aerial photography or satellite remote sensing during snowmelt.},

  abstract = {For economic and efficiency reasons, blended acquisition of seismic data is becoming increasingly commonplace. Seismic deblending methods are computationally demanding and normally consist of multiple processing steps. Furthermore, the process of selecting parameters is not always trivial. Machine-learning-based processing has the potential to significantly reduce processing time and to change the way seismic deblending is carried out. We have developed a data-driven deep-learning-based method for fast and efficient seismic deblending. The blended data are sorted from the common-source to the common-channel domain to transform the character of the blending noise from coherent events to incoherent contributions. A convolutional neural network is designed according to the special characteristics of seismic data and performs deblending with results comparable to those obtained with conventional industry deblending algorithms. To ensure authenticity, the blending was performed numerically and only field seismic data were used, including more than 20,000 training examples. After training and validating the network, seismic deblending can be performed in near real time. Experiments also indicate that the initial signal-to-noise ratio is the major factor controlling the quality of the final deblended result. The network is also demonstrated to be robust and adaptive by using the trained model to first deblend a new data set from a different geologic area with a slightly different delay time setting and second to deblend shots with blending noise in the top part of the record.},

Consequently, the landscape of such regions typically bears the strong imprint of ice- and snow-related processes operating over Quaternary-to-modern timescales. There has been strong research interest in the nature, rate, and efficacy of cold-region geomorphic processes, though most research has been devoted to glacial and permafrost phenomena, with comparably few studies having quantitatively addressed the role of snow as a land-forming agent. Here we review current research on land-forming processes related to glacial erosion and deposition, permafrost and periglacial processes, and snow-related processes such as nivation, snow creep, and snow avalanching. Our objective is to highlight those questions that drive current research and indicate others that seem sufficiently worthy to further our understanding of geomorphic form and process in the cryosphere. We do so bearing in mind that such knowledge is essential for successfully predicting form and process, and hence avoiding snow- and ice-related hazards. We conclude by outlining a number of recommendations for future research in the field.},

This article finds that this function of the error correction values cannot be assumed to be stationary. As a result, QM lacks justification to inflate/deflate various moments of the climate change signal. Previous adaptations of QM, most notably quantile delta mapping (QDM), have been developed that do not rely on this assumption of stationarity. Here, we outline a methodology called scaled distribution mapping (SDM), which is conceptually similar to QDM, but more explicitly accounts for the frequency of rain days and the likelihood of individual events. The SDM method is found to outperform QM, QDM, and detrended QM in its ability to better preserve raw climate model projected changes to meteorological variables such as temperature and precipitation.},

For geomorphologists reconstructing landform and drainage structure is frequently as important as elevation accuracy. Consequently, large-scale topographic maps (with contours, height points and watercourses) constitute excellent material for creating models (here called Topo-DEM) in fine resolution. The purpose of the conducted analyses was to assess the quality of Topo-DEM against freely-available global DEMs and then to compare it with a reference model derived from laser scanning (LiDAR-DEM). The analysis also involved derivative maps of geomorphometric parameters (local relief, slope, curvature, aspect) generated on the basis of Topo-DEM and LiDAR-DEM. Moreover, comparative classification of landforms was carried out. It was indicated that Topo-DEM is characterised by good elevation accuracy (RMSE {$<$}2 m) and reflects the topography of the analyzed area surprisingly well. Additionally, statistical and percentage metrics confirm that it is possible to generate a DEM with very good quality parameters on the basis of a large-scale topographic map (1:10,000): elevation differences between Topo-DEM and: 1) topographic map amounted from-1.68 to +2.06 m,MAEis 0.10 m, RMSE 0.16 m; 2) LiDAR-DEM (MAE 1.13 m, RMSE 1.69 m, SD 1.83 m); 3) GPS RTK measurements amounted from-3.6 to +3.01 m, MAE is 0.72 m, RMSE 0.97 m, SD 0.97 m. For an area of several dozen km               2               Topo-DEM with 10{\texttimes}10 m resolution proved more efficient than detailed (1{\texttimes}1 m) LiDAR-DEM.},

Classifying flood events by their causative processes may assist in enhancing the accuracy of local and regional flood frequency estimates and support the detection and interpretation of any changes in flood occurrence and magnitudes. This paper provides a critical review of existing causative classifications of instrumental and preinstrumental series of flood events, discusses their validity and applications, and identifies opportunities for moving toward more comprehensive approaches. So far no unified definition of causative mechanisms of flood events exists. Existing frameworks for classification of instrumental and preinstrumental series of flood events adopt different perspectives: hydroclimatic (large-scale circulation patterns and atmospheric state at the time of the event), hydrological (catchment scale precipitation patterns and antecedent catchment state), and hydrograph-based (indirectly considering generating mechanisms through their effects on hydrograph characteristics). All of these approaches intend to capture the flood generating mechanisms and are useful for characterizing the flood processes at various spatial and temporal scales. However, uncertainty analyses with respect to indicators, classification methods, and data to assess the robustness of the classification are rarely performed which limits the transferability across different geographic regions. It is argued that more rigorous testing is needed. There are opportunities for extending classification methods to include indicators of space{\textendash}time dynamics of rainfall, antecedent wetness, and routing effects, which will make the classification schemes even more useful for understanding and estimating floods.

  abstract = {Topography is a critical element in the hydrological response of a drainage basin and its availability in the form of digital elevation models (DEMs) has advanced the modeling of hydrological and hydraulic processes. However, progress experienced in these fields may stall, as intrinsic characteristics of free DEMs may limit new findings, while at the same time new releases of free, high-accuracy, global digital terrain models are still uncertain. In this paper, the limiting nature of free DEMs is dissected in the context of hydrogeomorphology. Ten sets of terrain data are analyzed: the SRTM GL1 and GL3, HydroSHEDS, TINITALY, ASTER GDEM, EU DEM, VFP, ALOS AW3D30, MERIT and the TDX. In specific, the influence of three parameters are investigated, i.e., spatial resolution, hydrological reconditioning and vertical accuracy, on four relevant geomorphic terrain descriptors, namely the upslope contributing area, the local slope, the elevation difference and the flow path distance to the nearest stream, H and D, respectively. The Tanaro river basin in Italy is chosen as the study region and the newly released LiDAR for the Italian territory is used as benchmark to reassess vertical accuracies. In addition, the EU-Hydro photo-interpreted river network is used to compare DEM-based river networks. Most DEMs approximate well the frequency curve of elevations of the LiDAR, but this is not necessarily reflected in the representation of geomorphic features. For example, DEMs with finer spatial resolution present larger contributing areas; differences in the slope can reach 10\%; between 5 m and 12 m H, none of the considered DEMs can faithfully represent the LiDAR; D presents significant variability between DEMs; and river network extraction can be problematic in flatter terrain. It is also found that the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) is given by the MERIT, 2.85 m, while the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) is given by the SRTM GL3, 4.83 m. Practical implications of choosing a DEM over another may be expected, as the limitations of any particular DEM in faithfully reproducing critical geomorphic terrain features may hinder our ability to find satisfactory answers to some pressing problems.},

This study develops a highly efficient framework for this task by coupling deep learning (DL) and physical modeling. This framework is developed and tested using regional climate simulations performed over a domain covering Montreal and adjoining regions, for the summers of 2015{\textendash}2020, at 2.5~km and 250~m resolutions. The DL framework uses a recurrent approach and considers atmospheric physical processes, such as advection, to generate high-resolution information from low-resolution data, which enables it to recreate fine details and produce temporally consistent fields. The DL framework generates realistic high-resolution precipitation estimates, including intense short-duration precipitation events, which allows it to be applied in engineering problems, such as evaluating the climate resiliency of urban storm drainage systems. The results portray the value of the proposed DL framework, which can be extended to other resolutions, periods, and regions.},

While causes are not thoroughly explored, there is a strong relationship between GCM biases in snow albedo feedback during snowmelt and bias correction resulting in unrealistic DTR values. We propose a technique to bias correct DTR, based on comparing observations and GCM historic simulations, and combine that with either bias correcting daily maximum temperatures and calculating daily minimum temperatures or vice versa. By basing the bias correction on a base period of 1961{\textendash}1980 and validating it during a test period of 1981{\textendash}1999, we show that bias correcting DTR and maximum daily temperature can produce more accurate estimations of daily temperature extremes while avoiding the pathological cases of unrealistic DTR values.},

This article performs a comprehensive evaluation on its quality by using 3-D elevation program (3DEP) digital elevation model (DEM) and hundreds of survey marks of two counties in the USA. The evaluation is carried out in terms of data specification, survey marks, land cover, season and time (day or night) of acquisition, incidence angle, and terrain slope. The ATL08 height errors are further modeled as a function of laser incidence angle and canopy coverage. It is found out the height from ATL08 product lies between the 3DEP DEM and true ground surface. The uncertainty of ATL08 height is 0.2 m for plain terrain, and 2 m for mountainous terrain where the majority of ATL08 segments are not useful for terrain extraction. The terrain height gets more underestimated by ATL08 products in regions with large terrain slope or incidence angle and more overestimated where the terrain is covered by dense canopy. Furthermore, seasonal variation of terrain height error can be as high as 0.8 m, while the impact of acquisition time is less than 0.3 m. We expect these findings to be informative for the utilization of ATL08 terrain product by worldwide users, and for the improvement of future ATL08 product.},

  abstract = {Climate change may alter the geographical pattern and intensity of near-surface winds which are the ``fuel'' for wind turbines. In a context of fast current and planned development of wind power worldwide, investigating the impacts of climate change on wind power generation is necessary. This study aims at assessing future changes in the potential for wind power generation over the whole Europe and in the effective wind power production from national wind farms operating at the end of 2012 and planned by 2020. For this purpose, a simplified wind power generation model is applied to an ensemble of 15 regional climate projections achieved from 10 Regional Climate Models downscaling six Global Climate Models under the SRES A1B emission scenario from the ENSEMBLES project. The use of a relatively large multi-model ensemble allows the identification of robust changes and the estimation of a range of uncertainties associated with projected changes. We show with a high level of confidence that, under the A1B scenario, over most of Europe, changes in wind power potential will remain within {$\pm$}15 and {$\pm$}20~\% by mid and late century respectively. Overall, we find a tendency toward a decrease of the wind power potential over Mediterranean areas and an increase over Northern Europe. Changes in multi-year power production will not exceed 5 and 15~\% in magnitude at the European and national scale respectively for both wind farms in operation at the end of 2012 and planned by 2020. Therefore, climate change should neither undermine nor favor wind energy development in Europe. However, accounting for climate change effects in particular regions may help optimize the wind power development and energy mix plans.},

These users are sensitive to many aspects of the observational references they employ to estimate the wind resource, such as the mean wind, its seasonality and long-term trends. However, the assessment of the ability of atmospheric reanalyses to reproduce wind speed trends has not been undertaken yet. The wind speed trends have been estimated using the ERA-Interim reanalysis (ERA-I), the second version of the Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) and the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55) for the period 1980{\textendash}2015. These trends show a strong spatial and seasonal variability with an overall increase of the wind speed over the ocean and a tendency to a decline over land, although important disagreements between the different reanalyses have been found. In particular, the JRA-55 reanalysis produces more intense trends over land than ERA-I and MERRA-2. This can be linked to the negative bias affecting the JRA-55 near-surface wind speeds over land. In all the reanalyses high wind speeds tend to change faster than both low and average wind speeds. The agreement of the wind speed trends at 850 hPa with those found close to the surface suggests that the main driver of the wind speed trends are the changes in large-scale circulation.},

  abstract = {The recent availability of freely and openly available satellite remote sensing products has enabled the implementation of global surface water monitoring at a level not previously possible. Here we present a global set of satellite-derived time series of surface water storage variations for lakes and reservoirs for a period that covers the satellite altimetry era. Our goals are to promote the use of satellite-derived products for the study of large inland water bodies and to set the stage for the expected availability of products from the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, which will vastly expand the spatial coverage of such products, expected from 2021 on. Our general strategy is to estimate global surface water storage changes ( V ) in large lakes and reservoirs using a combination of paired water surface elevation (WSE) and water surface area (WSA) extent products. Specifically, we use data produced by multiple satellite altimetry missions (TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, Jason-2, Jason-3, and Envisat) from 1992 on, with surface extent estimated from Terra/Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from 2000 on. We leverage relationships between elevation and surface area (i.e., hypsometry) to produce estimates of V even during periods when either of the variables was not available. This approach is successful provided that there are strong relationships between the two variables during an overlapping period. Our target is to produce time series of V as well as of WSE and WSA for a set of 347 lakes and reservoirs globally for the 1992{\textendash}2018 period. The data sets presented and their respective algorithm theoretical basis documents are publicly available and distributed via the Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO DAAC; https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/, last access: 13 May 2020) of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Specifically, the WSE data set is available at https://doi.org/10.5067/UCLRS-GREV2 (Birkett et al., 2019), the WSA data set is available at https://doi.org/10.5067/UCLRS-AREV2 (Khandelwal and Kumar, 2019), and the V data set is available at https://doi.org/10.5067/UCLRS-STOV2 (Tortini et al., 2019). The records we describe represent the most complete global surface water time series available from the launch of TOPEX/Poseidon in 1992 (beginning of the satellite altimetry era) to the near present. The production of long-term, consistent, and calibrated records of surface water cycle variables such as in the data set presented here is of fundamental importance to baseline future SWOT products.},

Results presented herein show that the altimeter generally performed in accordance with its original performance requirements of measuring altitude to a precision of less than 10-cm rms, SWH to an accuracy of{\textbackslash}pm0.5m or 10 percent whichever is greater, and ocean backscatter coefficient to an accuracy of{\textbackslash}pm1dB, all over an SWH range of 1 to 20 m.},

We specifically demonstrate the Python Earth Engine API by calculating three hydrocarbon indices: fluorescence, rotation absorption, and normalized fluorescence. The Python Earth Engine API provides an ideal environment for testing these indices with varied oil seeps and spills by (1) removing barriers of proprietary software formats and (2) providing an extensive library of data analysis tools (e.g., Pandas and Seaborn) and classification algorithms (e.g., Scikit-learn and TensorFlow). Our results demonstrate end-member cases in which fluorescence and normalized fluorescence indices of seawater and oil are statistically similar and different. As expected, predictive classification is more effective and the calculated probability of oil is more accurate for scenarios in which seawater and oil are well separated in the fluorescence space.},

The results reveal a diverse pattern that is caused by spatially greatly varying glacier sensitivity, in particular to precipitation availability and changes. We introduce a spatially resolved zonation where ICESat samples are grouped into units of similar glacier behaviour, glacier type and topographic settings. In several regions, our new zonation reveals local differences and anomalies that have not been described previously. Glaciers in the Eastern Pamirs, Kunlun Shan and central TP were thickening by 0.1{\textendash}0.7\&thinsp;m\&thinsp;a\textsuperscript{-1}, and the thickening anomaly has a crisp boundary in the Eastern Pamirs that continues just north of the central Karakoram. Glaciers in the south and east of the TP were thinning, with increasing rates towards southeast. We attribute the glacier thickening signal to a stepwise increase in precipitation around {$\sim$}1997{\textendash}2000 on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The precipitation change is reflected by growth of endorheic lakes in particular in the northern and eastern TP. We estimate lake volume changes through a combination of repeat lake extents from Landsat data and shoreline elevations from ICESat and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) for over 1300 lakes. The rise in water volume contained in the lakes corresponds to 4{\textendash}25\&thinsp;mm\&thinsp;a\textsuperscript{-1}, when distributed over entire catchments, for the areas where we see glacier thickening. The precipitation increase is also visible in sparse in situ measurements and MERRA-2 climate reanalysis data but less visible in ERA-Interim reanalysis data. Taking into account evaporation loss, the difference between average annual precipitation during the 1990s and 2000s suggested by these datasets is 34{\textendash}100\&thinsp;mm\&thinsp;a\textsuperscript{-1}, depending on region, which can fully explain both lake growth and glacier thickening (Kunlun Shan) or glacier geometry changes such as thinning tongues while upper glacier areas were thickening or stable (eastern TP). The precipitation increase reflected in these glacier changes possibly extended to the northern slopes of the Tarim Basin, where glaciers were nearly in balance in 2003{\textendash}2008. Along the entire Himalaya, glaciers on the first orographic ridge, which are exposed to abundant precipitation, were thinning less than glaciers in the dryer climate of the inner ranges. Thinning rates in the Tien Shan vary spatially but are rather stronger than in other parts of HMA.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Abstract. Using sparsely glaciated southern Norway as a case study, we assess the potential and limitations of ICESat laser altimetry for analysing regional glacier elevation change in rough mountain terrain. Differences between ICESat GLAS elevations and reference elevation data are plotted over time to derive a glacier surface elevation trend for the ICESat acquisition period 2003{\textendash}2008. We find spatially varying biases between ICESat and three tested digital elevation models (DEMs): the Norwegian national DEM, SRTM DEM, and a high-resolution lidar DEM. For regional glacier elevation change, the spatial inconsistency of reference DEMs {\textendash} a result of spatio-temporal merging {\textendash} has the potential to significantly affect or dilute trends. Elevation uncertainties of all three tested DEMs exceed ICESat elevation uncertainty by an order of magnitude, and are thus limiting the accuracy of the method, rather than ICESat uncertainty. ICESat matches glacier size distribution of the study area well and measures small ice patches not commonly monitored in~situ. The sample is large enough for spatial and thematic subsetting. Vertical offsets to ICESat elevations vary for different glaciers in southern Norway due to spatially inconsistent reference DEM age. We introduce a per-glacier correction that removes these spatially varying offsets, and considerably increases trend significance. Only after application of this correction do individual campaigns fit observed in~situ glacier mass balance. Our correction also has the potential to improve glacier trend significance for other causes of spatially varying vertical offsets, for instance due to radar penetration into ice and snow for the SRTM DEM or as a consequence of mosaicking and merging that is common for national or global DEMs. After correction of reference elevation bias, we find that ICESat provides a robust and realistic estimate of a moderately negative glacier mass balance of around -0.36\,{$\pm$}\,0.07\,m ice per year. This regional estimate agrees well with the heterogeneous but overall negative in~situ glacier mass balance observed in the area.},

  abstract = {Direct snow depth measurements are sparse, especially in remote areas. In this study, we assess the potential of ICESat laser altimetry for providing snow depths for its operational period 2003{\textendash}2009 on the example of the Scandinavian Mountains in southern Norway. Snow cover during ICESat campaigns typically results in positive elevation differences (dh) between ICESat GLAH14 elevations and reference elevations from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). Three DEMs are used: the Norwegian national DEM for the entire study area, and the SRTM DEM and a high-resolution airborne lidar DEM for a spatial subset on the Hardangervidda mountain plateau. To account for uncertainty in elevation data, ICESat samples are grouped into spatial subsets, elevation bands, and over time (e.g. all winter campaigns together). We find that ICESat has the potential to provide regional-scale snow depths for the years 2003{\textendash}2009 for its winter (March) and late spring (June) campaigns. ICESat-derived snow depth time series for different elevation bands agree well with measured (RMSE 0.47m) and modelled (RMSE 0.61m) snow depths in the study area. Annual differences in snow amounts and the increase of snow depths with elevation and coastal proximity over the study area are correctly reproduced. Uncertainties in reference elevations exceed ICESat elevation uncertainty and good control over errors and biases in reference DEMs turn out essential. Spatially varying vertical offsets between ICESat and the reference DEMs make it necessary to bias-correct March/June snow depths with autumn dh per spatial unit or elevation band. Best results are achieved when samples are summarised per season over the entire observation period. After correction of local DEM biases, the spatial pattern of ICESat 2003{\textendash}2009 March dh matches spatially distributed modelled snow depths in southern Norway with decimeter-scale accuracy. In the western part of Hardangervidda, ICESat-based March snow depths agree better with measurements (RMSE {$\leq$}0.15m for all DEMs) than modelled snow depths do (RMSE 0.61m). In eastern Hardangervidda, the coarse resolution SRTM DEM (RMSE 0.41m) performs better than the 10m Norwegian DEM (RMSE 0.64m) which is based on a less consistent mosaic of elevation data. Using the high-resolution lidar DEM, even single footprints show good agreement (R2 0.59, RMSE 0.94m) with measured snow depths from the same year. Snow depth estimates could be further improved by using full waveform ICESat data or elevation measurements from ICESat-2 once this satellite is operational. Good quality reference DEMs may still be acquired in the future even in areas where no such data exists today.},

Such glaciers are relatively rare but occur in many of the world's glacierized areas. High basal water pressures and extreme basal sliding are common characteristics during surges, but key questions concerning this usually spectacular phenomenon remain open. Why are glaciers in some regions surge-type but not in others, what sort of ``memory'' lets glaciers surge again and again, what is the influence of climate, geology, and topography? Besides their scientific interest, glacier surges can also be a threat to humans, especially in connection with rapid ice advances, but more importantly with rapidly forming lakes and their sudden outbursts. Cases of hazard- and disaster-related glacier surges and mitigation strategies are described from the Pamirs, the Andes, Tibet, the Italian Alps, and Alaska.},

The one-dimensional and mean two-dimensional power spectra of snow depth exhibit power law behavior in two frequency intervals separated by a scale break located between 7 m and 45 m. The spectral exponents for the low-frequency range vary between 0.1 and 1.2 for the one-dimensional spectra, and between 1.3 and 2.2 for the mean two-dimensional power spectra. The spectral exponents for the high-frequency range vary between 3.3 and 3.6 for the one-dimensional spectra, and between 4.0 and 4.5 for the mean two-dimensional spectra. Such spectral exponents indicate the existence of two distinct scaling regimes, with significantly larger variations occurring in the larger-scale regime. Similar bilinear power law spectra were obtained for the fields of vegetation height, with crossover wavelengths between 7 m and 14 m. Further analysis of the snow depth and vegetation fields, together with wind data, support the conclusion that the break in the scaling behavior of snow depth is controlled by the scaling characteristics of the spatial distribution of vegetation height when snow redistribution by wind is minimal and canopy interception is dominant, and by the interaction of winds with features such as surface concavities and vegetation when snow redistribution by wind is dominant.},

  abstract = {Seasonal snow cover is the largest single component of the cryosphere in areal extent, covering an average of 46 {\texttimes} 106 km2 of Earth's surface (31 \% of the land area) each year, and is thus an important expression and driver of the Earth's climate. In recent years, Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover has been declining at about the same rate ({$\sim$} -13 \% per decade) as Arctic summer sea ice. More than one-sixth of the world's population relies on seasonal snowpack and glaciers for a water supply that is likely to decrease this century. Snow is also a critical component of Earth's cold regions' ecosystems, in which wildlife, vegetation, and snow are strongly interconnected. Snow water equivalent (SWE) describes the quantity of water stored as snow on the land surface and is of fundamental importance to water, energy, and geochemical cycles. Quality global SWE estimates are lacking. Given the vast seasonal extent combined with the spatially variable nature of snow distribution at regional and local scales, surface observations are not able to provide sufficient SWE information. Satellite observations presently cannot provide SWE information at the spatial and temporal resolutions required to address science and high-socio-economic-value applications such as water resource management and streamflow forecasting. In this paper, we review the potential contribution of X- and Ku-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for global monitoring of SWE. SAR can image the surface during both day and night regardless of cloud cover, allowing high-frequency revisit at high spatial resolution as demonstrated by missions such as Sentinel-1. The physical basis for estimating SWE from X- and Ku-band radar measurements at local scales is volume scattering by millimeter-scale snow grains. Inference of global snow properties from SAR requires an interdisciplinary approach based on field observations of snow microstructure, physical snow modeling, electromagnetic theory, and retrieval strategies over a range of scales. New field measurement capabilities have enabled significant advances in understanding snow microstructure such as grain size, density, and layering. We describe radar interactions with snow-covered landscapes, the small but rapidly growing number of field datasets used to evaluate retrieval algorithms, the characterization of snowpack properties using radar measurements, and the refinement of retrieval algorithms via synergy with other microwave remote sensing approaches. This review serves to inform the broader snow research, monitoring, and application communities on progress made in recent decades and sets the stage for a new era in SWE remote sensing from SAR measurements.},

To this aim, we focus on Spain and consider daily precipitation output from an ensemble of Regional Climate Models provided by the ENSEMBLES project. The reanalysis-driven Regional Climate Model (RCM) data provide the historical data (with day-to-day correspondence with observations induced by the forcing boundary conditions) to conduct the analog search of the control (20C3M) and future (A1B) global climate model (GCM)-driven RCM values. First, we show that the MOS-Analog method outperforms the raw RCM output in the control 20C3M scenario (period 1971{\textendash}2000) for all considered regions and precipitation indices, although for the worst-performing models the method is less effective. Second, we show that the MOS-Analog method broadly preserves the original RCM climate change signal for different future periods (2011{\textendash}2040, 2041{\textendash}2070, 2071{\textendash}2100), except for those indices related to extreme precipitation. This could be explained by the limitation of the analog method to extrapolate unobserved precipitation records. These results suggest that the MOS-Analog is a spatially consistent alternative to standard bias correction methods, although the limitation for extreme values should be taken with caution in cases where this aspect is relevant for the problem.},

During the last decade, several global DEMs have been released based on satellite data. ASTER and SRTM are the most widely used DEMs, but the more recently released, AW3D30, TanDEM-X and MERIT, are being increasingly used. Many researchers have studied the quality of these DEM products in recent years. However, there has been no comprehensive and systematic evaluation of their quality over areas with variable topography and land cover conditions. To provide this comparison, we examined the accuracy of six freely available global DEMs (ASTER, AW3D30, MERIT, TanDEM-X, SRTM, and NASADEM) in four geographic regions with different topographic and land use conditions. We used local high-precision elevation models (Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), Pleiades-1A) as reference models and all global models were resampled to reference model resolution (1m). In total, 608 million 1x1 m pixels were analyzed. To estimate the accuracy, we generated error rasters by subtracting each reference model from the corresponding global DEM and calculated descriptive statistics for this difference (e.g., median, mean, root-mean-square error (RMSE)). We also assessed the vertical accuracy as a function of the slope, slope aspect, and land cover. We found that slope had the strongest effect on DEM accuracy, with no relationship for slope aspect. The AW3D30 was the most robust and had the most stable performance in most of the tests and is therefore the best choice for an analysis of multiple geographic regions. SRTM and NASADEM also performed well where available, whereas NASADEM, as a successor of SRTM, showed only slight improvement in comparison to SRTM. MERIT and TanDEM-X also performed well despite their lower spatial resolution.},

For this purpose, geospatial data have been used as primary sources: Hexagon KH-9, ASTER, and LANDSAT optical images; SRTM digital radar elevation model; and ICESat elevation profiles. After the analyses, the two co-registration methods, namely M1, based on horizontal displacements and 3D shift vectors, and M2, based on three-dimensional transformations, turned out to be similar. The errors in the GMB were analyzed through a k index that considers, among other variables, the error in elevation change by testing four interpolation methods for filling gaps. We found that, in 63\% of the cases, the relative error in elevation change contributes 90\% or more to k index. The GMB throughout our study area reported that a loss value of -1.44 {$\pm$} 0.15 m w. e. a-1 (-3.0 Gt a-1) and an ice thinning median of -1.38 {$\pm$} 0.11 m a-1 occurred within the study period.

  abstract = {The impacts of climate change are felt by most critical systems, such as infrastructure, ecological systems, and power-plants. However, contemporary Earth System Models (ESM) are run at spatial resolutions too coarse for assessing effects this localized. Local scale projections can be obtained using statistical downscaling, a technique which uses historical climate observations to learn a low-resolution to high-resolution mapping. Depending on statistical modeling choices, downscaled projections have been shown to vary significantly terms of accuracy and reliability. The spatio-temporal nature of the climate system motivates the adaptation of super-resolution image processing techniques to statistical downscaling. In our work, we present DeepSD, a generalized stacked super resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) framework for statistical downscaling of climate variables. DeepSD augments SRCNN with multi-scale input channels to maximize predictability in statistical downscaling. We provide a comparison with Bias Correction Spatial Disaggregation as well as three Automated-Statistical Downscaling approaches in downscaling daily precipitation from 1 degree ({\textasciitilde}100km) to 1/8 degrees ({\textasciitilde}12.5km) over the Continental United States. Furthermore, a framework using the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) platform is discussed for downscaling more than 20 ESM models with multiple emission scenarios.},

  abstract = {Deep Learning (DL) methods have been transforming computer vision with innovative adaptations to other domains including climate change. For DL to pervade Science and Engineering (S\&E) applications where risk management is a core component, wellcharacterized uncertainty estimates must accompany predictions. However, S\&E observations and model-simulations often follow heavily skewed distributions and are not well modeled with DL approaches, since they usually optimize a Gaussian, or Euclidean, likelihood loss. Recent developments in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL), which attempts to capture uncertainties from noisy observations, aleatoric, and from unknown model parameters, epistemic, provide us a foundation. Here we present a discrete-continuous BDL model with Gaussian and lognormal likelihoods for uncertainty quantification (UQ). We demonstrate the approach by developing UQ estimates on ``DeepSD'', a super-resolution based DL model for Statistical Downscaling (SD) in climate applied to precipitation, which follows an extremely skewed distribution. We find that the discrete-continuous models outperform a basic Gaussian distribution in terms of predictive accuracy and uncertainty calibration. Furthermore, we find that the lognormal distribution, which can handle skewed distributions, produces quality uncertainty estimates at the extremes. Such results may be important across S\&E, as well as other domains such as finance and economics, where extremes are often of significant interest. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the first UQ model in SD where both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties are characterized.},

  abstract = {Statistical downscaling of Global Climate Models (GCMs) allows researchers to study local climate change effects decades into the future. A wide range of statistical models have been applied to downscaling GCMs but recent advances in machine learning have not been explored compared to traditional approaches. In this paper, we compare five Perfect Prognosis (PP) approaches, Ordinary Least Squares, Elastic-Net, and Support Vector Machine along with two machine learning methods Multi-task Sparse Structure Learning (MSSL) and Autoencoder Neural Networks. In addition, we introduce a hybrid Model Output Statistics and PP approach by modeling the residuals of Bias Correction Spatial Disaggregation (BCSD) with MSSL. Metrics to evaluate each method's ability to capture daily anomalies, large-scale climate shifts, and extremes are analyzed. Generally, we find inconsistent performance between PP methods in their ability to predict daily anomalies and extremes as well as monthly and annual precipitation. However, results suggest that L1 sparsity constraints aid in reducing error through internal feature selection. The MSSL+BCSD coupling, when compared with BCSD, improved daily, monthly, and annual predictability but decreased performance at the extremes. Hence, these results suggest that the direct application of state-of-the-art machine learning methods to statistical downscaling does not provide direct improvements over simpler, longstanding approaches.},

  abstract = {Regional climate models (RCMs) have a high computational cost due to their higher spatial resolution compared to global climate models (GCMs). Therefore, various downscaling approaches have been developed as a surrogate for the dynamical downscaling of GCMs. This study assesses the potential of using a cost-efficient machine learning alternative to dynamical downscaling by using the example case study of emulating surface mass balance (SMB) over the Antarctic Peninsula. More specifically, we determine the impact of the training framework by comparing two training scenarios: (a) a perfect and (b) an imperfect model framework. In the perfect model framework, the RCM-emulator learns only the downscaling function; therefore, it was trained with upscaled RCM (UPRCM) features at GCM resolution. This emulator accurately reproduced SMB when evaluated on UPRCM, but its predictions on GCM data conserved RCM-GCM inconsistencies and led to underestimation. In the imperfect model framework, the RCM-emulator was trained with GCM features and downscaled the GCM while exposed to RCM-GCM inconsistencies. This emulator predicted SMB close to the truth, showing it learned the underlying inconsistencies and dynamics. Our results suggest that a deep learning RCM-emulator can learn the proper GCM to RCM downscaling function while working directly with GCM data. Furthermore, the RCM-emulator presents a significant computational gain compared to an RCM simulation. We conclude that machine learning emulators can be applied to produce fast and fine-scaled predictions of RCM simulations from GCM data.},

During the planning of this Atlantis time lapse acquisition, it was realized that additional nodes would be available, which provided an opportunity to use those nodes to improve the 3D static seismic image. A modeling study was initiated with the objective to identify optimum placement of the additional nodes. The model was generated using realistic detailed stratigraphy modeling and several cases were studied by adding node patches in different directions. Observations show that the addition of the nodes to the South, has the largest impact on the imaging of Atlantis Field. To measure the imaging impact of each added node location a more detailed tool was generated; the node areal contribution map, which shows how much each individual node contributes to the image of the reservoir. Improved imaging was also shown by modeling of reduced node spacing and increased node density. Altogether, the insights from this modeling work enabled optimized acquisition design for the survey that was acquired on the Atlantis Field in 2014-2015.},

SD observations from weather stations are used as a reference for the pointwise comparison. The study area covers the Pannonian Basin region (part of Central and Eastern Europe). Results are presented for the 2006{\textendash}2010 and 1985{\textendash}2010 periods. All datasets adequately reproduce the average day-to-day variation of SD but with different error magnitudes. The ERA5 reanalysis and the CGLS product represent SD remarkably well, with correlation coefficients above 0.9 and mean errors close to zero. On the other hand, ERA5-Land and CARPATCLIM overestimate daily mean SD by 2{\textendash}3~cm for some stations and display lower correlations (0.7{\textendash}0.9) during the 26-year time span. The WRF simulations significantly overestimate SD in the melting period (February{\textendash}March). Reduction of the grid spacing from 50 to 10~km does not improve the results. The excessive snow cover might negatively impact land{\textendash}atmosphere interactions in the model and lead to biases like temperature underestimation found in previous regional climate model evaluation studies. The results indicate that even in regions where snow is not a major climatic factor, SD errors can be substantial and should be considered in model evaluation and adaptation. Over the Carpathian Mountain ranges, SD from the different data sources diverges to the extent that the sign of the monthly mean model bias changes depending on the choice of the reference dataset.},

  abstract = {Avalanche hazard assessment requires a very precise estimation of the release area, which still depends, to a large extent, on expert judgement of avalanche specialists. Therefore, a new algorithm for automated identification of potential avalanche release areas was developed. It overcomes some of the limitations of previous tools, which are currently not often applied in hazard mitigation practice. By introducing a multi-scale roughness parameter, fine-scale topography and its attenuation under snow influence is captured. This allows the assessment of snow influence on terrain morphology and, consequently, potential release area size and location. The integration of a wind shelter index enables the user to define release area scenarios as a function of the prevailing wind direction or single storm events. A case study illustrates the practical usefulness of this approach for the definition of release area scenarios under varying snow cover and wind conditions. A validation with historical data demonstrated an improved estimation of avalanche release areas. Our method outperforms a slope-based approach, in particular for more frequent avalanches; however, the application of the algorithm as a forecasting tool remains limited, as snowpack stability is not integrated. Future research activity should therefore focus on the coupling of the algorithm with snowpack conditions.},

  abstract = {3D symmetric sampling introduced in the 1990s is characterized by dense sampling of two of the four spatial coordinates. The two sparsely sampled coordinates determine the periodicity of the geometry and the dimension of the offset-vector tiles that can be used to generate pseudocommon-offset-vector gathers. These gathers turn out to be useful for prestack processing applications, such as regularization, migration velocity analysis, and azimuthal anisotropy analysis. Although single-point acquisition is the ideal acquisition method, it is not necessarily better than array-based acquisition. Field arrays are still useful in suppressing noise and need not harm signal in most practical cases. In hybrid geometries three spatial coordinates are sampled densely. In all published cases at least two of the three are sampled quite coarsely and may not provide the best quality for the given trace density. Coil geometry (sailing in circles) is a special case of wide-azimuth towed streamer acquisition. It is essentially a random geometry that should be modifiable into a geometry with regularly sampled midpoints, absolute offsets and azimuths. Despite recent technological developments, the basic idea of 3D symmetric sampling still is a highly useful principle for the design of land and marine 3D seismic surveys.},

The ages that are generally reported for these fossils are around 197\,thousand years (kyr) for the Kibish Omo I3,6,7, and around 160{\textendash}155\,kyr for the Herto hominins5,8. However, the stratigraphic relationships and tephra correlations that underpin these estimates have been challenged6,8. Here we report geochemical analyses that link the Kamoya's Hominid Site (KHS) Tuff9, which conclusively overlies the member of the Omo-Kibish Formation that contains Omo I, with a major explosive eruption of Shala volcano in the Main Ethiopian Rift. By dating the proximal deposits of this eruption, we obtain a new minimum age for the Omo fossils of 233\,{$\pm$}\,22\,kyr. Contrary to previous arguments6,8, we also show that the KHS Tuff does not correlate with another widespread tephra layer, the Waidedo Vitric Tuff, and therefore cannot anchor a minimum age for the Herto fossils. Shifting the age of the oldest known Homo sapiens fossils in eastern Africa to before around 200\,thousand years ago is consistent with independent evidence for greater antiquity of the modern human lineage10.},

  abstract = {Conventional marine seismic surveys typically mobilize a single vessel towing two airgun source arrays in front of a spread of ten or more streamers. The data acquired in this way are narrow-azimuth and lack near offsets owing to the distance between the sources and the streamers which can be in the range of 100 to 200 m for the inner cables and up to 500 m for the outer cables. Several solutions, such as coil shooting (French, 1984; Ross, 2008) or advanced multi-vessel operations (Mandroux et al., 2013), have been proposed and deployed to improve azimuth coverage and fold. Although these are excellent solutions for achieving wide-azimuth data, they are generally expensive and/ or time-consuming, and none of them record zero-offset data. Near- and zero-offset data are, however, especially critical for imaging shallow geological targets and of great benefit for multiple attenuation. In this paper, we present a tailored solution to this challenge that allows the recording of both zero-offset data and dual azimuths in an effective and safe way. We call this acquisition solution TopSeis.

  abstract = {Placing marine sources on the top of the seismic streamer spread improves resolution and reservoir inversion in shallow and intermediate depth targets. This is due to the abundance of near offset data and high illumination compared to conventional marine seismic. A drawback of this top source solution is the lack of long offsets, which are important for deeper imaging and AVO. In this paper, we present a combined solution with sources on both the top and in the front of the spread. We deploy the front sources from the streamer vessel, while a separate dedicated source vessel is towing the widely separated top sources on top of the spread. With successful deblending of the different sources, this solution could give an operationally efficient solution to the seismic imaging and inversion problem, for both shallow and deep targets, and providing both high and low frequencies. We will present the acquisition concept and describe the deblending strategy, to address the common challenge to any multiple-source blended acquisition.},

The goal of this study is to identify the main features of blowing snow events at an alpine site and assess the ability of the detailed snowpack model Crocus to reproduce the occurrence of these events in a 1D configuration. We created a database of blowing snow events observed over 10years at our experimental site. Occurrences of blowing snow events were divided into cases with and without concurrent falling snow. Overall, snow transport is observed during 10.5\% of the time in winter and occurs with concurrent falling snow 37.3\% of the time. Wind speed and snow age control the frequency of occurrence. Model results illustrate the necessity of taking the wind-dependence of falling snow grain characteristics into account to simulate periods of snow transport and mass fluxes satisfactorily during those periods. The high rate of false alarms produced by the model is investigated in detail for winter 2010/2011 using measurements from snow particle counters.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The interaction of mountain terrain with meteorological processes causes substantial temporal and spatial variability in snow accumulation and ablation. Processes impacted by complex terrain include large-scale orographic enhancement of snowfall, small-scale processes such as gravitational and wind-induced transport of snow, and variability in the radiative balance such as through terrain shadowing. In this study, a multi-scale modelling approach is proposed to simulate the temporal and spatial evolution of high-mountain snowpacks. The multi-scale approach combines atmospheric data from a numerical weather prediction system at the kilometre scale with process-based downscaling techniques to drive the Canadian Hydrological Model (CHM) at spatial resolutions allowing for explicit snow redistribution modelling. CHM permits a variable spatial resolution by using the efficient terrain representation by unstructured triangular meshes. The model simulates processes such as radiation shadowing and irradiance to slopes, blowing-snow transport (saltation and suspension) and sublimation, avalanching, forest canopy interception and sublimation, and snowpack melt. Short-term, kilometre-scale atmospheric forecasts from Environment and Climate Change Canada's Global Environmental Multiscale Model through its High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System (HRDPS) drive CHM and are downscaled to the unstructured mesh scale. In particular, a new wind-downscaling strategy uses pre-computed wind fields from a mass-conserving wind model at 50 m resolution to perturb the mesoscale HRDPS wind and to account for the influence of topographic features on wind direction and speed. HRDPS-CHM was applied to simulate snow conditions down to 50 m resolution during winter 2017/2018 in a domain around the Kananaskis Valley ({$\sim$}1000 km\textsuperscript{2}) in the Canadian Rockies. Simulations were evaluated using high-resolution airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) snow depth data and snow persistence indexes derived from remotely sensed imagery. Results included model falsifications and showed that both wind-induced and gravitational snow redistribution need to be simulated to capture the snowpack variability and the evolution of snow depth and persistence with elevation across the region. Accumulation of windblown snow on leeward slopes and associated snow cover persistence were underestimated in a CHM simulation driven by wind fields that did not capture lee-side flow recirculation and associated wind speed decreases. A terrain-based metric helped to identify these lee-side areas and improved the wind field and the associated snow redistribution. An overestimation of snow redistribution from windward to leeward slopes and subsequent avalanching was still found. The results of this study highlight the need for further improvements of snowdrift-permitting models for large-scale applications, in particular the representation of subgrid topographic effects on snow transport.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Climate change impact studies commonly use impact models (such as hydrological or crop models) forced with corrected climate input data from global climate models. A range of downscaling and bias correction methods have been developed to increase the spatial resolution and remove systematic biases in climate model outputs to be applied before use in impact models. Many studies have focused on evaluating such approaches for the climate variables they aim to correct. However, due to nonlinear error propagation there can be large remaining biases in model outputs, even when ingesting bias corrected climate forcings. Here we propose an impact-centric evaluation framework for downscaling and bias correction methods to be used in climate change risk assessments. This framework evaluates and compares the strengths and limitations of downscaling and bias correction in the impact domain, highlighting approaches that lead to reduced biases in impact variables of interest. We demonstrate the evaluation framework in the context of assessing downscaling and bias correction methods for hydrological projections in Australia. Our results show that although all downscaling and bias correction methods evaluated perform adequately for the input climate variables, their errors vary markedly when the impact is modelled. Our proposed evaluation framework involves selecting a number of key performance metrics, and ranking the four downscaling and bias correction methods to compute an overall ranking, highlighting the best-performing methods for each statistical metric and the overall best-performing approach. We present an application of this approach using performance metrics relevant to hydrological applications, relating to mean biases, variability, heavy precipitation and peak runoff days, and dry conditions. For impact studies related to hydrological applications, we find that multi-variate bias correction that considers cross-correlations, temporal auto-correlations and biases at multiple time scales (daily to annual) performs best in reducing biases in hydrological output variables for Australia. Our proposed evaluation approach can be applied to a wide range of climate change applications where downscaling and bias correction are required, including impacts on agricultural production, wildfires, energy generation, human health, ecosystem functioning, and water resource management.},

  abstract = {Accurate knowledge on snow distribution in alpine terrain is crucial for various applications such as flood risk assessment, avalanche warning or managing water supply and hydro-power. To simulate the seasonal snow cover development in alpine terrain, the spatially distributed, physics-based model Alpine3D is suitable. The model is typically driven by spatial interpolations of observations from automatic weather stations (AWS), leading to errors in the spatial distribution of atmospheric forcing. With recent advances in remote sensing techniques, maps of snow depth can be acquired with high spatial resolution and accuracy. In this work, maps of the snow depth distribution, calculated from summer and winter digital surface models based on Airborne Digital Sensors (ADS), are used to scale precipitation input data, with the aim to improve the accuracy of simulation of the spatial distribution of snow with Alpine3D. A simple method to scale and redistribute precipitation is presented and the performance is analysed. The scaling method is only applied if it is snowing. For rainfall the precipitation is distributed by interpolation, with a simple air temperature threshold used for the determination of the precipitation phase. It was found that the accuracy of spatial snow distribution could be improved significantly for the simulated domain. The standard deviation of absolute snow depth error is reduced up to a factor 3.4 to less than 20 cm. The mean absolute error in snow distribution was reduced when using representative input sources for the simulation domain. For inter-annual scaling, the model performance could also be improved, even when using a remote sensing dataset from a different winter. In conclusion, using remote sensing data to process precipitation input, complex processes such as preferential snow deposition and snow relocation due to wind or avalanches, can be substituted and modelling performance of spatial snow distribution is improved.},

  abstract = {Much of our knowledge about future changes in precipitation relies on global (GCMs) and/or regional climate models (RCMs) that have resolutions which are much coarser than typical spatial scales of precipitation, particularly extremes. The major problems with these projections are both climate model biases and the gap between gridbox and point scale. Wong et al. (2014) developed a model to jointly bias correct and downscale precipitation at daily scales. This approach, however, relied on pairwise correspondence between predictor and predictand for calibration, and, thus, on nudged simulations which are rarely available. Here we present an extension of this approach that separates the downscaling from the bias correction and in principle is applicable to free-running GCMs/RCMs. In a first step, we bias correct RCM-simulated precipitation against gridded observations at the same scale using a parametric quantile mapping (QMgrid) approach. In a second step, we bridge the scale gap: we predict local variance employing a regression-based model with coarse-scale precipitation as a predictor. The regression model is calibrated between gridded and point-scale (station) observations. For this concept we present one specific implementation, although the optimal model may differ for each studied location. To correct the whole distribution including extreme tails we apply a mixture distribution of a gamma distribution for the precipitation mass and a generalized Pareto distribution for the extreme tail in the first step. For the second step a vector generalized linear gamma model is employed. For evaluation we adopt the perfect predictor experimental setup of VALUE. We also compare our method to the classical QM as it is usually applied, i.e., between RCM and point scale (QMpoint). Precipitation is in most cases improved by (parts of) our method across different European climates. The method generally performs better in summer than in winter and in winter best in the Mediterranean region, with a mild winter climate, and worst for continental winter climate in Mid- and eastern Europe or Scandinavia. While QMpoint performs similarly (better for continental winter) to our combined method in reducing the bias and representing heavy precipitation, it is not capable of correctly modeling point-scale spatial dependence of summer precipitation. A strength of this two-step method is that the best combination of bias correction and downscaling methods can be selected. This implies that the concept can be extended to a wide range of method combinations.},

However, SDMs are not able to capture small-scale dynamical changes unresolved by GCMs. For this reason, we propose a two-step generalized validation process to evaluate the performance of any statistical downscaling method relative to regional climate model (RCM) simulations driven by the same GCM fields. First, we compare historical station-based observations with simulations obtained from a statistical model fitted to and driven by reanalysis fields, and then driven by historical GCM fields. Then, the SDM is required to produce future projections consistent with RCM simulations used as pseudo-observations under future emissions scenarios. Using the climate extension of the fifth generation Penn-State/NCAR Mesoscale Model (CMM5) driven by NCAR/DOE Parallel Climate Model (PCM) simulations, we apply this method to identify the strengths/weaknesses of a nonhomogeneous stochastic weather typing method.},

Time-lapse seismic investigations commonly use conventional broadband seismic data, considered low to moderate resolution in our context. We have developed the first comprehensive time -lapse analysis of high-resolution seismic data by assessing the repeatability of P-cable 3D seismic data (approximately 30{\textendash}350~Hz) with short offsets and a high density of receivers. P-cable 3D seismic data sets have for decades been used to investigate shallow fluid flow and gas-hydrate systems. We analyze P-cable high-resolution 4D (HR4D) seismic data from three different geologic settings in the Arctic Circle. The first two are test sites with no evidence of shallow subsurface fluid flow, and the third is an active seepage site. Using these sites, we evaluate the reliability of the P-cable 3D seismic technology as a time-lapse tool and establish a 4D acquisition and processing workflow. Weather, waves, tide, and acquisition-parameters such as residual shot noise are factors affecting seismic repeatability. We achieve reasonable quantitative repeatability measures in stratified marine sediments at two test locations. However, repeatability is limited in areas that have poor penetration of seismic energy through the seafloor, such as glacial moraines or rough surface topography. The 4D anomalies in the active seepage site are spatially restricted to areas of focused fluid flow and might likely indicate changes in fluid flow. This approach can thus be applied to detect migration of fluids in active leakage structures, such as gas chimneys.},

Statistical downscaling seeks a probabilistic map to transform low-resolution data from a (possibly biased) coarse-grained numerical scheme to high-resolution data that is consistent with a high-fidelity scheme. Our framework tackles the problem by tandeming two transformations: a debiasing step that is performed by an optimal transport map, and an upsampling step that is achieved by a probabilistic diffusion model with a posteriori conditional sampling. This approach characterizes a conditional distribution without the need for paired data, and faithfully recovers relevant physical statistics from biased samples. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach on one- and two-dimensional fluid flow problems, which are representative of the core difficulties present in numerical simulations of weather and climate. Our method produces realistic high-resolution outputs from low-resolution inputs, by upsampling resolutions of 8{\texttimes} and 16{\texttimes}. Moreover, our procedure correctly matches the statistics of physical quantities, even when the low-frequency content of the inputs and outputs do not match, a crucial but difficult-to-satisfy assumption needed by current state-of-the-art alternatives.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the lessons learned from analysis of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land-Surface Temperature/Emissivity (LST) products in the current (V4) and previous versions, and presents eight new refinements for V5 product generation executive code (PGE16) and the test results with real Terra and Aqua MODIS data. The major refinements include considering surface elevation when using the MODIS cloudmask product, removal of temporal averaging in the 1 km daily level-3 LST product, removal of cloud-contaminated LSTs in level-3 LST products, and the refinements for the day/night LST algorithm. These refinements significantly improved the spatial coverage of LSTs, especially in highland regions, and the accuracy and stability of the MODIS LST products. Comparisons between V5 LSTs and in-situ values in 47 clear-sky cases (in the LST range from - 10 {$^\circ$}C to 58 {$^\circ$}C and atmospheric column water vapor range from 0.4 to 3.5 cm) indicate that the accuracy of the MODIS LST product is better than 1 K in most cases (39 out of 47) and the root of mean squares of differences is less than 0.7 K for all 47 cases or 0.5 K for all but the 8 cases apparently with heavy aerosol loadings. Emissivities retrieved by the day/night algorithm are well compared to the surface emissivity spectra measured by a sun-shadow method in two field campaigns. The time series of V5 MODIS LST product over two sites (Lake Tahoe in California and Namco lake in Tibet) in 2003 are evaluated, showing that the quantity and quality of MODIS LST products depend on clear-sky conditions because of the inherent limitation of the thermal infrared remote sensing.},

  title = {WRF-Based Dynamical Downscaling over High Mountain Asia},
  author = {Wang, Xun},
  year = {2022},
  urldate = {2023-04-05},
  abstract = {High Mountain Asia (HMA) is a mountainous area including the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and surrounding mountain ranges. Due to its unique climatic and tectonic settings, the HMA region is highly vulnerable to natural hazards, such as landslides and Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs). Under climate change, the frequency of natural hazards is expected to increase, posing further threats to society and human lives in HMA. Due to the lack of meteorological data, the triggering mechanisms of atmospherically induced natural hazards, especially landslides, are still not fully understood in HMA, which hinders the development of early-warning systems. To overcome this issue, a new atmospheric data set: the High Asia Refined analysis version 2 (HAR v2), was developed and is presented in this thesis. The HAR v2 was generated by dynamical downscaling of ERA5 reanalysis data using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF). The HAR v2 provides atmospheric data at 10 km grid spacing and hourly temporal resolution. It is currently available from 2000 to 2020 and will be extended back to 1979. Compared to the old version, the HAR v2 covers a broader area and a longer temporal range. To find the optimal model configuration of the HAR v2, several sensitivity experiments were conducted. Validation of the HAR v2 against in-situ stations from the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD) shows that the HAR v2 fits well with observations and outperforms its forcing data ERA5. In addition, the HAR v2 and a version of the HAR v2 run with 2 km grid spacing (HAR v2 2 km) were compared with other commonly used gridded precipitation data sets (reanalysis data, satellite retrieval, and interpolated in-situ observations), over a sub-region in HMA with rugged terrain. Results indicate the added value of the HAR v2 and HAR v2 2 km since they are the only products that can reproduce orographic precipitation and capture more extreme events. One of the primary goals of the HAR v2 is to provide atmospheric data for landslide researches in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, one of the landslide hot spots in the HMA region. The newly developed HAR v2 was combined with historical landslide inventories to investigate the atmospheric triggering mechanisms of landslides in this region. Results reveal the crucial role of snowmelt in landslide triggering in this region and the added value of climatic disposition derived from atmospheric triggering conditions in landslide susceptibility mapping. Furthermore, the majority of previous studies applied rainfall estimates from in-situ gauges or satellite retrievals. This study also highlights the potential of dynamical downscaling products generated by regional climate models in landslide prediction. Dynamical downscaling has already been extensively applied to understand the present-day climate and also future climate. In the last part of this thesis, the applicability of dynamical downscaling in the context of paleoclimate is demonstrated. Here, two global climate simulations for the present day and the mid-Pliocene ( {$\sim$} 3 Ma) were dynamically downscaled to 30 km grid spacing over HMA, using the same model configuration as the HAR v2. By keeping land surface conditions the same in both downscaling experiments, this study was able to isolate the influence of large-scale climate states and reveal its role in maintaining the Qaidam mega-lake system during the mid-Pliocene. An increase of the water balance (‚àÜS), i.e., the change in terrestrial water storage was found, when the mid-Pliocene climate is imposed on the Qaidam Basin (QB) with its modern land surface settings. This imbalance of ‚àÜS induced solely by the changes in large-scale climate state would lead to an increase of lake extent until a new equilibrium state is reached. The estimated equilibrium lake extent is 12\%-21\% of the maximum lake extent approximated from proxy data.},

The three laser sensors of GLAS acquired a large volume of data between 2003 and 2009. These data were used widely to detect changes in Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and to determine forest heights, sea-ice freeboard heights and the distribution of cloud and aerosols. Here, we provide a review of these applications, describe the methodology involved in GLAS data processing and summarize some of the challenges to make better use of GLAS data. Other applications, including ice-sheet slope extraction, distinguishing between water, bare land, urban building and high forest, urban building height extraction, changes in glaciers and ice caps and water levels in lakes are discussed more briefly.},

A number of materials were employed as a liner to insulate a typical cardboard box, and the effect of these materials on package insulative performance was evaluated through experimental tests and the transistent thermal model. The results showed that application of aluminium foil to the internal liner surface of polyethylene gave 46\% increase in the package insulative performance compared with the original polyethylene-insulated packages. An improvement of 79\% and 106\% in insulative performance per unit liner thickness was obtained from packages insulated with a polyisocyanurate board and aerogel blanket compared with the polystyrene-insulated package. The results also indicated that temperature surrounding the package played a significant role in the maximum insulation time. Furthermore, an excellent agreement was obtained between the mathematical model and the experimental results across all packaging aspects studied in this work.},

It has been successfully and widely utilized. A new version (HAR v2) with longer temporal coverage and extended domains is currently under development. ERA5 reanalysis data is used as forcing data. This study aims to find the optimal set-up for the production of the HAR v2 to provide similar or even better accuracy as the HAR. First, we conducted a sensitivity study, in which different cumulus, microphysics, planetary boundary layer, and land surface model schemes were compared and validated against in situ observations. The technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) method was applied to identify the best schemes. Snow depth in ERA5 is overestimated in High Mountain Asia (HMA) and causes a cold bias in the WRF output. Therefore, we used Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55) to correct snow depth initialized from ERA5 based on the linear scaling approach. After applying the best schemes identified by the TOPSIS method and correcting the initial snow depth, the model performance improves. Finally, we applied the improved set-up for the HAR v2 and computed a one-year run for 2011. Compared to the HAR, the HAR v2 has a better representation of air temperature at 2 m. It produces slightly higher precipitation amounts, but the spatial distribution of seasonal mean precipitation is closer to observations.},

However, very low-quality inputs cannot offer accurate geometric prior while high-quality references are inaccessible, limiting the applicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose GFP-GAN that leverages rich and diverse priors encapsulated in a pretrained face GAN for blind face restoration. This Generative Facial Prior (GFP) is incorporated into the face restoration process via novel channel-split spatial feature transform layers, which allow our method to achieve a good balance of realness and fidelity. Thanks to the powerful generative facial prior and delicate designs, our GFP-GAN could jointly restore facial details and enhance colors with just a single forward pass, while GAN inversion methods require expensive image-specific optimization at inference. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance to prior art on both synthetic and real-world datasets.},

Effects on both 4D amplitude difference and 4D depth shifts were studied. The results show that although receiver decimation gradually degrades the data quality, 4D noise stays at a relatively low level when the number of receivers is reduced by a factor of 2 or 4, and 4D depth shifts can be preserved with even fewer receivers. As a comparison, non-repeated receiver positions make much larger impact on the data quality. It is observed that a 400m receiver mispositioning is equivalent to receiver reduction by a factor of 4 approximately, and further increasing the mismatch does not make significant difference. We also explored different node layout geometries and found that irregular node configurations worked better than regular lines when the node positions were not repeated. Implications of these findings on future time-lapse survey designs are discussed.},

  abstract = {Full-waveform inversion (FWI), proposed by Lailly and Tarantola in the 1980s, is considered to be the most promising data-driven tool for automatically building velocity models. Many successful examples have been reported using FWI to update shallow sediments, gas pockets, and mud volcanoes. However, successful applications of FWI to update salt structures had almost only been seen on synthetic data until recent progress at the Atlantis Field in the Gulf of Mexico. We revisited some aspects of FWI algorithms to minimize cycle-skipping and amplitude discrepancy issues and derived an FWI algorithm that is able to build complex salt velocity models. We applied this algorithm to a variety of data sets, including wide-azimuth and full-azimuth (FAZ) streamer data as well as ocean-bottom-node data, with different geologic settings in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for salt velocity updates and to examine some fundamentals of the salt problem. We observed that, in multiple cases, salt velocity models from this FWI algorithm produced subsalt images of superior quality. We demonstrate with one FAZ streamer data example in Keathley Canyon that we do not necessarily need very high frequency in FWI for subsalt imaging purposes. Based on this observation, we envision that sparse node for velocity acquisition may provide appropriate data to handle large and complex salt bodies with FWI. We believe the combination of advanced FWI algorithms and appropriate data acquisition will bring a step change to subsalt imaging.},

Chen Keywords: Thermal remote sensing Urban thermal anisotropy Angular effect MODIS land surface temperature (LST) Model simulation A B S T R A C T Satellite observation of land surface temperature (LST) is an important tool for monitoring urban thermal environments but is prone to significant angular effects over non-isothermal pixels characterized by the substantial three-dimensional (3D) structure of urban areas. However, accurately characterizing the urban thermal anisot-ropy at the satellite pixel scale is still challenging. In this paper, comparing the simultaneous airborne observations and the temporal-aggregated signal from MODIS LST, we further investigate the seasonal and diurnal patterns of thermal anisotropy in urban areas with various simulation scenarios. The anisotropy was defined as the difference between off-nadir and nadir temperatures. First, a realistic morphological representation of urban surfaces as well as urban component temperatures measured by infrared thermometers (IRTs) were input into the discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model to simulate MODIS-scale anisotropy for Toulouse, France in summer. Extending this 'IRT-DART' method to other seasons was restricted because the IRTs' radiative source areas are affected by shadows when the sun elevation is low, meaning that measured sunlit temperatures are not reliably available. An energy balance model, TUF3D, and a sensor view model, SUM, for simplified urban geometry were coupled to replace 'IRT-DART' in winter. The cross-comparison shows that 'TUF-SUM' can simulate MODIS-scale anisotropy if urban structure and materials are relatively homogeneous, which provides a basis for assessing anisotropy when IRT sunlit temperatures are unavailable. The MODIS anisotropy is subject to a strong diurnal yet a discernable seasonal variation. For example, for a mid-latitude city, the anisotropy over all MODIS view angles reaches up to 6.6 K for Terra-Day (around 11:00 local time) and 4.9 K for Aqua-Day (around 13:00) in summer, and 6.1 K for Terra-Day and 4.0 K for Aqua-Day in winter. Nocturnal anisotropy is weak with values less than 0.2 K. The modeling methods can be used to quantify anisotropy of satellite LST in a broad range of urban environments and facilitate the use of multi-angular MODIS LST for a better assessment of urban thermal environments in the future.}

We use selected proxy-based reconstructions of different climate variables, together with state-of-the-art time series of natural forcings (orbital variations, solar activity variations, large tropical volcanic eruptions, land cover and greenhouse gases), underpinned by results from General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMICs), to establish a comprehensive explanatory framework for climate changes from the Mid-Holocene (MH) to pre-industrial time. The redistribution of solar energy, due to orbital forcing on a millennial timescale, was the cause of a progressive southward shift of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). This was accompanied by a pronounced weakening of the monsoon systems in Africa and Asia and increasing dryness and desertification on both continents. The associated summertime cooling of the NH, combined with changing temperature gradients in the world oceans, likely led to an increasing amplitude of the El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and, possibly, increasingly negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) indices up to the beginning of the last millennium. On decadal to multi-century timescales, a worldwide coincidence between solar irradiance minima, tropical volcanic eruptions and decadal to multi-century scale cooling events was not found. However, reconstructions show that widespread decadal to multi-century scale cooling events, accompanied by advances of mountain glaciers, occurred in the NH (e.g., in Scandinavia and the European Alps). This occurred namely during the Little Ice Age (LIA) between AD {$\sim$}1350 and 1850, when the lower summer insolation in the NH, due to orbital forcing, coincided with solar activity minima and several strong tropical volcanic eruptions. The role of orbital forcing in the NH cooling, the southward ITCZ shift and the desertification of the Sahara are supported by numerous model simulations. Other simulations have suggested that the fingerprint of solar activity variations should be strongest in the tropics, but there is also evidence that changes in the ocean heat transport took place during the LIA at high northern latitudes, with possible additional implications for climates of the Southern Hemisphere (SH).},

  abstract = {Modelling glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) or `j{\"o}kulhlaups', necessarily involves the propagation of large and often stochastic uncertainties throughout the source to impact process chain. Since flood routing is primarily a function of underlying topography, communication of digital elevation model (DEM) uncertainty should accompany such modelling efforts. Here, a new stochastic first-pass assessment technique was evaluated against an existing GIS-based model and an existing 1D hydrodynamic model, using three DEMs with different spatial resolution. The analysis revealed the effect of DEM uncertainty and model choice on several flood parameters and on the prediction of socio-economic impacts. Our new model, which we call MC-LCP (Monte Carlo Least Cost Path) and which is distributed in the supplementary information, demonstrated enhanced `stability' when compared to the two existing methods, and this `stability' was independent of DEM choice. The MC-LCP model outputs an uncertainty continuum within its extent, from which relative socio-economic risk can be evaluated. In a comparison of all DEM and model combinations, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM exhibited fewer artefacts compared to those with the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM), and were comparable to those with a finer resolution Advanced Land Observing Satellite Panchromatic Remote-sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (ALOS PRISM) derived DEM. Overall, we contend that the variability we find between flood routing model results suggests that consideration of DEM uncertainty and pre-processing methods is important when assessing flow routing and when evaluating potential socio-economic implications of a GLOF event. Incorporation of a stochastic variable provides an illustration of uncertainty that is important when modelling and communicating assessments of an inherently complex process.},

  abstract = {Digital elevation models (DEMs) represent the topography that drives surface flow and are arguably one of the more important data sources for deriving variables used by numerous hydrologic models. A considerable amount of research has been conducted to address uncertainty associated with error in digital elevation models (DEMs) and the propagation of error to derived terrain parameters. This review brings together a discussion of research in fundamental topical areas related to DEM uncertainty that affect the use of DEMs for hydrologic applications. These areas include: (a) DEM error; (b) topographic parameters frequently derived from DEMs and the associated algorithms used to derive these parameters; (c) the influence of DEM scale as imposed by grid cell resolution; (d) DEM interpolation; and (e) terrain surface modification used to generate hydrologicallyviable DEM surfaces. Each of these topical areas contributes to DEM uncertainty and may potentially influence results of distributed parameter hydrologic models that rely on DEMs for the derivation of input parameters. The current state of research on methods developed to quantify DEM uncertainty is reviewed. Based on this review, implications of DEM uncertainty and suggestions for the GIS research and user communities are offered.},

  abstract = {Abstract In order to confront climate change and reach the ambitious goals set at COP 26, established renewable energy sources like wind and solar need to expand to new frontiers. For wind, the transition to offshore environments poses unique opportunities and challenges. While offshore wind farms promise more energy efficiency, their construction demands larger investments in foundations and infrastructure. Glacial movement that transported material over the various epochs has resulted in a liberal distribution of problematic boulders in exactly the kind of areas now proving ideal for the deployment of wind farm technology. This is especially evident in large stretches of the Baltic, North Sea and North Atlantic on the east coast of North America where boulders, carried south through glacial movements during the ice ages, pose significant hazards for the construction of new offshore infrastructure. To be able to carry out subsea construction work with reduced risk, a novel ultra-high-resolution (UHR) seismic measurement system has been developed by the Fraunhofer Institute for Wind Energy Systems IWES, Bremen, Germany, and the University of Bremen, Germany. The Manta Ray G1 that has been developed is specifically designed to detect and localize these small-scale objects in marine sediments with high accuracy using seismic diffraction imaging. As these boulders pose an obvious problem for the construction work it is the ability of the system to commit to dedicated object detection, e.g., for glacial boulders, integrated into a detailed ground model of the uppermost section of the subseafloor in challenging shallow-water regimes that offers a highly advantageous solution to the problem. The system uses a unique new survey methodology for the de-risking of offshore construction sites.},

We present a transient permafrost model, CryoGrid 2, that calculates ground temperatures according to conductive heat transfer in the soil and in the snowpack. CryoGrid 2 is forced by operational air temperature and snow-depth products for potential permafrost areas in Southern Norway for the period 1958 to 2009 at 1 km2 spatial resolution. In total, an area of about 80 000 km2 is covered. The model results are validated against borehole temperatures, permafrost probability maps from ``bottom temperature of snow'' measurements and inventories of landforms indicative of permafrost occurrence. The validation demonstrates that CryoGrid 2 can reproduce the observed lower permafrost limit to within 100 m at all validation sites, while the agreement between simulated and measured borehole temperatures is within 1 K for most sites. The number of grid cells with simulated permafrost does not change significantly between the 1960s and 1990s. In the 2000s, a significant reduction of about 40 \% of the area with average 2 m ground temperatures below 0 ‚ó¶C is found, which mostly corresponds to degrading permafrost with still negative temperatures in deeper ground layers. The thermal conductivity of the snow is the largest source of uncertainty in CryoGrid 2, strongly affecting the simulated permafrost area. Finally, the prospects of employing CryoGrid 2 as an operational soil-temperature product for Norway are discussed.},

  abstract = {High-resolution topographic surveying is traditionally associated with high capital and logistical costs, so that data acquisition is often passed on to specialist third party organisations. The high costs of data collection are, for many applications in the earth sciences, exacerbated by the remoteness and inaccessibility of many field sites, rendering cheaper, more portable surveying platforms (i.e. terrestrial laser scanning or GPS) impractical. This paper outlines a revolutionary, low-cost, user-friendly photogrammetric technique for obtaining high-resolution datasets at a range of scales, termed `Structure-from-Motion' (SfM). Traditional softcopy photogrammetric methods require the 3-D location and pose of the camera(s), or the 3-D location of ground control points to be known to facilitate scene triangulation and reconstruction. In contrast, the SfM method solves the camera pose and scene geometry simultaneously and automatically, using a highly redundant bundle adjustment based on matching features in multiple overlapping, offset images. A comprehensive introduction to the technique is presented, followed by an outline of the methods used to create high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) from extensive photosets obtained using a consumer-grade digital camera. As an initial appraisal of the technique, an SfM-derived DEM is compared directly with a similar model obtained using terrestrial laser scanning. This intercomparison reveals that decimetre-scale vertical accuracy can be achieved using SfM even for sites with complex topography and a range of land-covers. Example applications of SfM are presented for three contrasting landforms across a range of scales including; an exposed rocky coastal cliff; a breached moraine-dam complex; and a glacially-sculpted bedrock ridge. The SfM technique represents a major advancement in the field of photogrammetry for geoscience applications. Our results and experiences indicate SfM is an inexpensive, effective, and flexible approach to capturing complex topography.},

  abstract = {The impact of a pre-existing rift fabric on normal fault array evolution during a subsequent phase of lithospheric extension is investigated using 2-D and 3-D seismic reflection, and borehole data from the northern Horda Platform, Norwegian North Sea. Two fault populations are developed: (i) a population comprising relatively tall ({$>$}2 km), N-S-striking faults, which have {$>$}1.5 km of throw. These faults are up to 60 km long, penetrate down into crystalline basement and bound the eastern margins of 6{\textendash}15 km wide half-graben, which contain {$>$}3 km of pre-Jurassic, likely Permo{\textendash}Triassic, but possibly Devonian syn-rift strata; and (ii) a population comprising vertically restricted ({$<$}1 km), NW-SE-striking faults, which are more closely spaced (0.5{\textendash}5 km), have lower displacements (30{\textendash}100 m) and not as long (2{\textendash}10 km) as those in the N{\textendash}S-striking population. The NW-SE-striking population typically occurs between the N-S-striking population, and may terminate against or cross-cut the larger structures. NW{\textendash}SE-striking faults do not bound pre-Jurassic half-graben and are largely restricted to the Jurassic-to-Cretaceous succession. Seismic-stratigraphic observations, and the stratigraphic position of the fault tips in both fault populations, allow us to reconstruct the Late Jurassic-to-Early Cretaceous growth history of the northern Horda Platform fault array. We suggest the large, N-S-striking population was active during the Permo{\textendash}Triassic and possibly earlier (Devonian?), before becoming inactive and buried during the Early and Middle Jurassic. After a period of relative tectonic quiescence, the N-S-striking, pre-Jurassic fault population propagated through the Early-Middle Jurassic cover and individual fault systems rapidly (within {$<$}10 Ma) established their maximum length in response to Late Jurassic extension. These fault systems became the dominant structures in the newly formed fault array and defined the locations of the main, Late Jurassic-to-Early Cretaceous, syn-rift depocentres. Late Jurassic extension was also accommodated by broadly synchronous growth of the NW-SE-striking fault population; the eventual death of this population occurred in response to the localization of strain onto the N{\textendash}S-striking fault population. Our study demonstrates that the inheritance of a pre-existing rift fabric can influence the geometry and growth of individual fault systems and the fault array as a whole. On the basis of observations made in this study, we present a conceptual model that highlights the influence of a pre-existing rift fabric on fault array evolution in polyphase rifts.},

High resolution data, proper spatial sampling, as well as near offset/near angle information are key elements for imaging and quantitative interpretation. We first discuss several existing acquisition and imaging technologies that have been applied in the area, including standard towed streamer surveys, p-cable, and imaging with separated wavefields. We then introduce novel acquisition concepts. The innovative combination of high density seismic and wider towing of sources can be a cost-effective approach to acquire high quality seismic data with significantly improved near offset coverage and denser spatial sampling for shallow imaging. These configurations can be tuned such that both shallow and deeper targets are optimally imaged.},

  abstract = {The spatial dependence of meteorological variables is crucial for many impacts, for example, droughts, floods, river flows, energy demand, and crop yield. There is thus a need to understand how well it is represented in downscaling (DS) products. Within the COST Action VALUE, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis of spatial variability in the output of over 40 different DS methods in a perfect predictor setup. The DS output is evaluated against daily precipitation and temperature observations for the period 1979{\textendash}2008 at 86 sites across Europe and 53 sites across Germany. We have analysed the dependency of correlations of daily temperature and precipitation series at station pairs on the distance between the stations. For the European data set, we have also investigated the complexity of the downscaled data by calculating the number of independent spatial degrees of freedom. For daily precipitation at the German network, we have additionally evaluated the dependency of the joint exceedance of the wet day threshold and of the local 90th percentile on the distance between the stations. Finally, we have investigated regional patterns of European monthly precipitation obtained from rotated principal component analysis. We analysed Perfect Prog (PP) methods, which are based on statistical relationships derived from observations, as well as Model Output Statistics (MOS) approaches, which attempt to correct simulated variables. In summary, we found that most PP DS methods, with the exception of multisite analog methods and a method that explicitly models spatial dependence yield unrealistic spatial characteristics. Regional climate model-based MOS methods showed good performance with respect to correlation lengths and the joint occurrence of wet days, but a substantial overestimation of the joint occurrence of heavy precipitation events. These findings apply to the spatial scales that are resolved by our observation network, and similar studies with higher resolutions, which are relevant for small hydrological catchment, are desirable.},

  abstract = {General circulation models (GCMs) suggest that rising concentrations of greenhouse gases may have significant consequences for the global climate. What is less clear is the extent to which local (subgrid) scale meteorological processes will be affected. So-called 'downscaling' techniques have subsequently emerged as a means of bridging the gap between what climate modellers are currently able to provide and what impact assessors require. This article reviews the present generation of downscaling tools under four main headings: regression methods; weather pattern (circulation)-based approaches; stochastic weather generators; and limited-area climate models. The penultimate section summarizes the results of an international experiment to intercompare several precipitation models used for downscaling. It shows that circulation-based downscaling methods perform well in simulating present observed and model-generated daily precipitation characteristics, but are able to capture only part of the daily precipitation variability changes associated with model-derived changes in climate. The final section examines a number of ongoing challenges to the future development of climate downscaling.},

  abstract = {Abstract Wind is widely recognized as one of the dominant controls of snow accumulation and distribution in exposed alpine regions. Complex and highly variable wind fields in rugged terrain lead to similarly complex snow distribution fields with areas of no snow adjacent to areas of deep accumulation. Unfortunately, these complexities have limited inclusion of wind redistribution effects in spatial snow distribution models. In this study the difficulties associated with physically exhaustive wind field modeling are avoided and terrain-based parameters are developed to characterize wind effects. One parameter, , was based on maximum upwind slopes relative to seasonally averaged winds to characterize the wind scalar at each pixel location in an alpine basin. A second parameter, , measured upwind breaks in slope from a given location and was combined with an upwind application of to create a drift delineator parameter, D0, which was used to delineate sites of intense redeposition on lee slopes. Based on 504 snow depth samples from a May 1999 survey of the upper Green Lakes Valley, Colorado, the correlation of the developed parameters to the observed snow distribution and the effect of their inclusion in a spatial snow distribution model were quantified. The parameter was found to be a significant predictor, accounting for more of the variance in the observed snow depth than could be explained by elevation, solar radiation, or slope. Samples located in D0-delineated drift zones were shown to have significantly greater depths than samples located in nondrift zones. A regression tree model of snow distribution based on a predictor variable set of , D0, elevation, solar radiation, and slope explained 8\%{\textendash}23\% more variance in the observed snow distribution, and performed noticeably better in unsampled areas of the basin, compared to a regression tree model based on only the latter three predictors.},

  abstract = {Abstract Winds, particularly high winds, strongly affect snowmelt and snow redistribution. High winds during rain-on-snow events can lead to catastrophic flooding while strong redistribution events in mountain environments can generate dangerous avalanche conditions. To provide adequate warnings, accurate wind data are required. Yet, mountain wind fields exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity at small spatial lengths that are not resolved by currently available gridded forecast data. Wind data from over 200 stations across Switzerland were used to evaluate two forecast surface wind products ({\textasciitilde}2- and 7-km horizontal resolution) and develop a statistical downscaling technique to capture these finer-scaled heterogeneities. Wind exposure metrics derived from a 25-m horizontal resolution digital elevation model effectively segregated high, moderate, and low wind speed sites. Forecast performance was markedly compromised and biased low at the exposed sites and biased high at the sheltered, valley sites. It was also found that the variability of predicted wind speeds at these sites did not accurately represent the observed variability. A novel optimization scheme that accounted for local terrain structure while also nudging the forecasted distributions to better match the observed distributions and variability was developed. The resultant statistical downscaling technique notably decreased biases across a range of elevations and exposures and provided a better match to observed wind speed distributions.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Snow in rock faces plays a key role in the alpine environment for permafrost distribution, snow water storage or runoff in spring. However, a detailed assessment of snow depths in steep rock walls has never been attempted. To understand snow distribution in rock faces a high-resolution terrestrial laser scanner (TLS), including a digital camera, was used to obtain interpolated snow depth (HS) data with a grid resolution of one metre. The mean HS, the snow covered area and their evolution in the rock face were compared to a neighbouring smoother catchment and a flat field station at similar elevation. Further we analyzed the patterns of HS distribution in the rock face after different weather periods and investigated the main factors contributing to those distributions.  In a first step we could show that with TLS reliable information on surface data of a steep rocky surface can be obtained. In comparison to the flatter sites in the vicinity, mean HS in the rock face was lower during the entire winter, but trends of snow depth changes were similar. We observed repeating accumulation and ablation patterns in the rock face, while maximum snow depth loss always occurred at those places with maximum snow depth gain. Further analysis of the main factors contributing to the snow depth distribution in the rock face revealed terrain-wind-interaction processes to be dominant. Processes related to slope angle seem to play a role, but no simple relationship between slope angle and snow depth was found.  Further analyses should involve measurements in rock faces with other characteristics and higher temporal resolutions to be able to distinguish individual processes better. Additionally, the relation of spatial and temporal distribution of snow depth to terrain {\textendash} wind interactions should be tested.},

We present a linearized inversion scheme for imaging narrow-azimuth (NAZ) and ocean-bottom data. Linearized inversion can enhance the resolution of the image, suppress migration artifacts, and increase the relative amplitude of true reflectors in the subsurface.

  abstract = {Six approaches for downscaling climate model outputs for use in hydrologic simulation were evaluated, with particular emphasis on each method's ability to produce precipitation and other variables used to drive a macroscale hydrology model applied at much higher spatial resolution than the climate model. Comparisons were made on the basis of a twenty-year retrospective (1975{\textendash}1995) climate simulation produced by the NCAR-DOE Parallel ClimateModel (PCM), and the implications of the comparison for a future(2040{\textendash}2060) PCM climate scenario were also explored. The six approaches were made up of three relatively simple statistical downscaling methods {\textendash} linear interpolation (LI), spatial disaggregation (SD), and bias-correction and spatial disaggregation (BCSD) {\textendash} each applied to both PCM output directly(at T42 spatial resolution), and after dynamical downscaling via a Regional Climate Model (RCM {\textendash} at 1/2-degree spatial resolution), for downscaling the climate model outputs to the 1/8-degree spatial resolution of the hydrological model. For the retrospective climate simulation, results were compared to an observed gridded climatology of temperature and precipitation, and gridded hydrologic variables resulting from forcing the hydrologic model with observations. The most significant findings are that the BCSD method was successful in reproducing the main features of the observed hydrometeorology from the retrospective climate simulation, when applied to both PCM and RCM outputs. Linear interpolation produced better results using RCM output than PCM output, but both methods (PCM-LI and RCM-LI) lead to unacceptably biased hydrologic simulations. Spatial disaggregation of the PCM output produced results similar to those achieved with the RCM interpolated output; nonetheless, neither PCM nor RCM output was useful for hydrologic simulation purposes without a bias-correction step. For the future climate scenario, only the BCSD-method (using PCM or RCM) was able to produce hydrologically plausible results. With the BCSD method, the RCM-derived hydrology was more sensitive to climate change than the PCM-derived hydrology.},

Lake surface conditions, such as ice cover, surface temperature, evaporation and water level, respond dramatically to this threat, as observed in recent decades. In this Review, we discuss physical lake variables and their responses to climate change. Decreases in winter ice cover and increases in lake surface temperature modify lake mixing regimes and accelerate lake evaporation. Where not balanced by increased mean precipitation or inflow, higher evaporation rates will favour a decrease in lake level and surface water extent. Together with increases in extreme-precipitation events, these lake responses will impact lake ecosystems, changing water quantity and quality, food provisioning, recreational opportunities and transportation. Future research opportunities, including enhanced observation of lake variables from space (particularly for small water bodies), improved in situ lake monitoring and the development of advanced modelling techniques to predict lake processes, will improve our global understanding of lake responses to a changing climate.},

  abstract = {Rain on snow (ROS) is a complex phenomenon leading to repeated flooding in many regions with a seasonal snow cover. The potential to generate floods during ROS depends not only on the magnitude of rainfall but also on the areal extent of the antecedent snow cover and the spatio-temporal interaction between meteorologic and snowpack properties. The complex interaction of these factors makes it difficult to accurately predict the effect of snow cover on runoff formation for an upcoming ROS event. In this study, the detailed physics-based snow cover model SNOWPACK was used to assess the influence of snow cover properties on converting rain input to available snowpack runoff during 191 ROS events for 58 catchments in the Swiss Alps. Conditions identified by the simulations that led to excessive snowpack runoff were a large snow-covered fraction, spatially homogeneous snowpack properties, prolonged rainfall events, and a strong rise in air temperature over the course of the event. These factors entail a higher probability of snowpack runoff occurring synchronously within the catchment, which in turn favours higher overall runoff rates. The findings suggest that during autumn and late spring, flooding due to ROS is more likely to happen, whereas during winter a coincidence of the above conditions in the study area is quite rare. For example, an autumn event which occurred in October 2011 resulted from a combination of spatially homogeneous snowpack conditions following a recent snowfall and high, but not exceptional rainfall, and led to major flooding. The results of this study provide key factors to assess in advance of an incoming ROS event and emphasize the importance of detailed snow monitoring for flood forecasting in snow-affected watersheds.},

This paper described the validation and comparison of three spaceborne missions for inland water level re\- trievals, including the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) onboard the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-1 (ICESat-1), as well as the newly launched Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) onboard ICESat-2 and the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) lidar on the International Space Station. This study was conducted over the Great Lakes and lower Mississippi River using in-situ data from 22 gauging stations, where the potential for monitoring inland water dynamics was explored. The results showed that ICESat-2 provided lake water level retrievals with an unprecedented accuracy (RMSE = 0.06 m, biases =- 0.01 {$\pm$} 0.05 m), followed by ICESat-1 (RMSE = 0.10 m, biases = - 0.04 {$\pm$} 0.10 m), and then by GEDI (RMSE = 0.28 m, biases = - 0.10 {$\pm$} 0.23 m). ICESat-2 also offered more accurate river water level measurements (RMSE = 0.12 m, biases = - 0.08 {$\pm$} 0.07 m) than those of ICESat-1 (RMSE = 0.25 m, biases = - 0.18 {$\pm$} 0.16 m) and GEDI (RMSE = 0.40 m, biases = - 0.24 {$\pm$} 0.24 m). The analysis suggested that for all the altimeters, the strong beam achieved higher water level accuracies than those of the weak, and the nighttime acquisitions were slightly more accurate than those of the daytime. However, our result indicated no considerable differences between mea\- surement accuracy and river width. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrated their great potential in monitoring inland water dynamics, especially with the combination of ICESat-2 and GEDI platforms. This study provided a comprehensive understanding of measurement accuracies of three recent missions and recommended that end users should employ the strong beam data acquired during the nighttime for accurate water level retrievals.},

This paper reviews the recent advances of airborne LiDAR systems and the use of LiDAR data for DEM generation, with special focus on LiDAR data filters, interpolation methods, DEM resolution, and LiDAR data reduction. Separating LiDAR points into ground and non-ground is the most critical and difficult step for DEM generation from LiDAR data. Commonly used and most recently developed LiDAR filtering methods are presented. Interpolation methods and choices of suitable interpolator and DEM resolution for LiDAR DEM generation are discussed in detail. In order to reduce the data redundancy and increase the efficiency in terms of storage and manipulation, LiDAR data reduction is required in the process of DEM generation. Feature specific elements such as breaklines contribute significantly to DEM quality. Therefore, data reduction should be conducted in such a way that critical elements are kept while less important elements are removed. Given the high-density characteristic of LiDAR data, breaklines can be directly extracted from LiDAR data. Extraction of breaklines and integration of the breaklines into DEM generation are presented.},

  abstract = {Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of Greenland provide the basic data for studying the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS), but little research quantitatively evaluates and compares the accuracy of various Greenland DEMs. This study uses IceBridge elevation data to evaluate the accuracies of the the Greenland Ice Map Project (GIMP)1 DEM, GIMP2 DEM, TanDEM-X, and ArcticDEM in their corresponding time ranges. This study also analyzes the impact of DEM accuracy and resolution on the accuracy of river network extraction. The results show that (1) within the time range covered by each DEM, TanDEM-X with an RMSE of 5.60 m has higher accuracy than the other DEMs in terms of absolute height accuracy, while GIMP1 has the lowest accuracy among the four Greenland DEMs, with an RMSE of 14.34 m. (2) Greenland DEMs are affected by regional errors and interannual changes. The accuracy in areas with elevations above 2000 m is higher than that in areas with elevations below 2000 m, and better accuracy is observed in the north than in the south. The stability of the ArcticDEM product is higher than those of the other three DEM products, and its RMSE standard deviation over multiple years is only 0.14 m. Therefore, the errors caused by the applications of DEMs with longer time spans are smaller. GIMP1 performs in an opposite manner, with a standard deviation of 2.39 m. (3) The river network extracted from TanDEM-X is close to the real river network digitized from remote sensing images, with an accuracy of 50.78\%. The river network extracted from GIMP1 exhibits the largest errors, with an accuracy of only 8.83\%. This study calculates and compares the accuracy of four Greenland DEMs and indicates that TanDEM-X has the highest accuracy, adding quantitative studies on the accuracy evaluation of various Greenland DEMs. This study also compares the results of different DEM river network extractions, verifies the impact of DEM accuracy on the accuracy of the river network extraction results, and provides an explorable direction for the hydrological analysis of Greenland as a whole.},

  abstract = {Abstract Changes in snow cover over the Qinghai{\textendash}Tibetan Plateau have attracted much attention in recent years owing to climate change. Because of the limitations of in situ observations, only a few studies have analyzed the dynamics of snow cover. Using observations from 103 meteorological stations across the Qinghai{\textendash}Tibetan Plateau, this study investigated the spatial and temporal variability of snow depth and the number of snow-cover days. The results show a very weak negative trend for the snow depth and the number of snow-cover days in spring and winter from 1961 to 2010, but two different trends were found: an initial increase followed by a decrease. In summer and autumn, snow depth and the number of snow-cover days show a significant decreasing trend for most sites. The duration of snow cover exhibits a significant decreasing trend (-3.5 {$\pm$} 1.2 days decade-1), which was jointly controlled by a later snow starting time (1.6 {$\pm$} 0.8 days decade-1) and an earlier snow ending time (-1.9 {$\pm$} 0.8 days decade-1) consistent with a response to climate change. This study highlights the competing effects of rising temperatures and changing precipitation, which remain an important challenge in understanding and interpreting the observed changes in snow depth and the number of snow-cover days for the Qinghai{\textendash}Tibetan Plateau.},

  abstract = {Airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) Bathymetry (ALB) has an unparalleled advantage in integrated sea-land measurements, especially in the acquisition of topographic data in shallow water areas. Sea surface waves are an important factor affecting the quality of ALB data. This paper presents a method that strictly corrects the sea surface wave-induced refraction error for each seabed laser pulse without any complex modeling of the sea surface. In this method, an adaptive neighborhood selection method is first used to calculate the normal sea surface at the moment when a laser pulse enters the water, and then a laser pulse refraction error correction model considering sea surface waves is constructed. The distance condition equation, the angle condition equation and the coplanar condition equation are established based on Snell's law and the geometric relationship among the incident laser pulse, the normal vector of the wavy sea surface and the actual refracted ray in order to calculate the coordinates of each laser point at the seabed after refraction error correction. The experimental results show that sea surface waves have a significant impact on the three-dimensional point cloud coordinates of the underwater topography. Even in calm sea conditions, the plane coordinate displacement error of the seabed point caused by the sea surface waves may reach the meter level, and the depth coordinate displacement error can also exceed 0.2 m. The corrected displacement errors of the planimetric coordinates are significantly greater than the corrected displacement errors of the depth coordinates, which can effectively improve the quality of the ALB data.},

Currently, Australia is facing serious water crisis owing to rainfall shortage and climate change, and national-scale data set on surface-water-level changes is required for supporting sustainable water resource management. Here, we used all Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM)+/Operational Land Imager (OLI) data available on Google Earth Engine to obtain annual surface water during 2003{\textendash}2019 and produced 1506 boundaries of water bodies with areas greater than 1 km2 across Australia. The produced surface water map in Australia is more accurate than the existing global lake databases (e.g., the Global Lakes and Wetlands Database), which can be downloaded for free. Then, 52 water bodies (lakes and reservoirs) with areas larger than 1 km2 and available Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat/ICESat-2) data for more than 5 years were combined to estimate trends in surface water levels in Australia. Across Australia, from 2003 to 2019, the area-weighted mean of water level change rates is -0.046 m/year with 17 lakes (32.7\%) with increasing water levels and 35 lakes (67.3\%) decreasing with water levels. In detail, the largest lakes ({$>$}100 km2) dominate the total change trend and most of the largest lakes underwent decreasing trend (-0.046 m/year), whereas the mean water levels of small lakes ({$<$}10 km2) increased in the past 17 years. In situ water levels of three typical lakes/reservoirs were used to validate our estimation results, which exhibited a very good agreement (R2 = 0.98).},

  abstract = {Accurate and detailed information on lake/reservoir water levels and temporal changes around the globe is urgently required for water resource management and related studies. The traditional satellite radar altimeters normally monitor water level changes of large lakes and reservoirs (i.e., greater than 1 km2) around the world. Fortunately, the recent Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) makes it possible to monitor water level changes for some small lakes and reservoirs (i.e., less than 1 km2). ICESat-2 ATL13 products provide observations of inland water surface heights, which are suitable for water level estimation at a global scale. In this study, ICESat-2 ATL13 products were used to conduct a global estimation and assessment of lake/reservoir water level changes. We produced monthly water levels for 13,843 lakes and reservoirs with areas greater than 0.1 km2 and all-season ATL13 products across the globe, in which 2257 targets are smaller than 1 km2. In total, the average valid number of months covered by ICESat-2 is 5.41 months and only 204 of 13,843 lakes and reservoirs have water levels in all the months in 2019. In situ water level data from 21 gauge stations across the United States and 12 gauge stations across Australia were collected to assess the monthly lake/reservoir water levels, which exhibited a high accuracy (RMSE = 0.08 m, r = 0.999). According to comparisons between the monthly water levels and changes from ATL08 products in another study and ATL13 products in this study, we found that both products can accurately estimate the monthly water level of lakes and reservoirs, but water levels derived from ATL13 products exhibited a higher accuracy compared with water levels derived from ATL08 products (RMSE = 0.28 m, r = 0.999). In general, the ATL13 product is more convenient because the HydroLAKES mask of inland water bodies, the orthometric height (with respect to the EGM2008 geoid) of water surfaces, and several data quality parameters specific to water surfaces were involved in the ATL13 product.},

  abstract = {The Bias Correction and Spatial Downscaling (BCSD) is a trend-preserving statistical downscaling algorithm, which has been widely used to generate accurate and high-resolution data set. We employ the BCSD technique to statistically downscale projected daily maximum temperature (DMT) over China from 13 general circulation models in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) project to supplement the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections data set under the Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6 (RCP2.6) scenario. We then compare the differences of DMT and four DMT-related indices (i.e., summer days (SU), annual maximum value of DMT (TXx), intensity, and frequency of heat wave) between before and after downscaling over eight subregions of China. The results indicate that the BCSD method reduces the cool bias of the DMT over the whole China compared with original CMIP5 simulations, especially over the Qinghai-Tibet plateau. The SU increases after downscaling for both China as a whole and most subregions except for South China. The BCSD also affects the mean value of TXx, intensity, and frequency of heat wave at subregional scales, although it shows little impact on China as a whole. Besides, the BCSD reduces the temporal variability of most indices except for the heat wave frequency. The most striking finding is that the intermodel spreads of DMT, SU, TXx, and heat wave intensity are dramatically reduced after downscaling compared with raw CMIP5 simulations. In summary, the BCSD method shows significant improvements to original CMIP5 climate projections under RCP2.6 scenario.},

  abstract = {Regional climate models (RCMs) have been developed and extensively applied for dynamically downscaling coarse resolution information from different sources, such as general circulation models (GCMs) and reanalyses, for different purposes including past climate simulations and future climate projection. Thus far, the nature, the methods, and a number of crucial issues concerning the use of dynamic downscaling are still not well understood. The most important issue is whether, and if so, under what conditions dynamic downscaling is really capable of adding more information at different scales compared to the GCM or reanalysis that imposes lateral boundary conditions (LBCs) to the RCMs. There are controversies regarding the downscaling ability. In this review paper we present several factors that have consistently demonstrated strong impact on dynamic downscaling ability in intraseasonal and seasonal simulations/predictions and future projection. Those factors include setting of the RCM experiment (e.g. imposed LBC quality, domain size and position, LBC coupling, and horizontal resolution); as well as physical processes, mainly convective schemes and vegetation and soil processes that include initializations, vegetation specifications, and planetary boundary layer and surface coupling. These studies indicate that RCMs have downscaling ability in some aspects but only under certain conditions. Any significant weaknesses in one of these aspects would cause an RCM to lose its dynamic downscaling ability. This paper also briefly presents challenges faced in current RCM dynamic downscaling and future prospective, which cover the application of coupled ocean{\textendash}atmosphere RCMs, ensemble applications, and future projections.},

  abstract = {Although our knowledge of climate change impacts on energy systems has increased substantially over the past few decades, there remains a lack of comprehensive overview of impacts across spatial scales. Here, we analyse results of 220 studies projecting climate impacts on energy systems globally and at the regional scale. Globally, a potential increase in cooling demand and decrease in heating demand can be anticipated, in contrast to slight decreases in hydropower and thermal energy capacity. Impacts at the regional scale are more mixed and relatively uncertain across regions, but strongest impacts are reported for South Asia and Latin America. Our assessment shows that climate impacts on energy systems at regional and global scales are uncertain due partly to the wide range of methods and non-harmonized datasets used. For a comprehensive assessment of climate impacts on energy, we propose a consistent multi-model assessment framework to support regional-to-global-scale energy planning.},

  abstract = {Spaceborne digital elevation models (DEMs) are a fundamental input for many geoscience studies, but they still include nonnegligible height errors. Here we introduce a high-accuracy global DEM at 3{${''}$} resolution ( 90 m at the equator) by eliminating major error components from existing DEMs. We separated absolute bias, stripe noise, speckle noise, and tree height bias using multiple satellite data sets and filtering techniques. After the error removal, land areas mapped with {$\pm$}2 m or better vertical accuracy were increased from 39\% to 58\%. Significant improvements were found in flat regions where height errors larger than topography variability, and landscapes such as river networks and hill-valley structures, became clearly represented. We found the topography slope of previous DEMs was largely distorted in most of world major floodplains (e.g., Ganges, Nile, Niger, and Mekong) and swamp forests (e.g., Amazon, Congo, and Vasyugan). The newly developed DEM will enhance many geoscience applications which are terrain dependent.},

  abstract = {Accurate remotely sensed snow depth (SD) data are essential for monitoring and modeling hydrological processes in cold regions. While the available passive microwave SD data have been widely used by the community, the coarse spatial resolution (typically at 0.25{$^\circ$}) of these data impedes the explicit representation of the hydrological processes in snow-dominated regions, especially in mountainous regions with complex terrain. To improve the spatial resolution and quality of passive microwave SD data for the Tibetan Plateau (TP), we develop a spatial{\textendash}temporal downscaling method to produce a 19-year, daily 0.05{$^\circ$} SD product by combining the existing high temporal resolution daily SD data and the high spatial resolution 8-day cloud-free Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based snow cover probability (SCP) data, the latter of which were produced using an new advanced temporal filter algorithm. Validations against the observed SD data from 92 meteorological stations suggest that the newly-developed 0.05{$^\circ$} SD product greatly improves upon the original 0.25{$^\circ$} version. Based on this 0.05{$^\circ$} SD product, we found that higher SD values are mainly distributed on the southeastern and eastern TP as well as the Himalaya and Karakoram, while much lower SD values occur on the inner TP. During 2000{\textendash}2018, the TP-averaged annual SD showed a slight (p~{$>~$}0.05) increasing trend because there were little changes in SD for most grids across the TP. Regarding different basins within TP, the annual SD during 2000{\textendash}2018 slightly increased over most basins except for the Amu Dayra, Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Inner TP, where the basin-scale SD showed insignificant decreasing tendencies. In general, the spatial{\textendash}temporal variations in the SD across the TP were very heterogeneous because SD was affected by multiple climatic factors. The newly-developed 0.05{$^\circ$} SD product could facilitate our understanding of the hydrological processes on the TP through a more explicit representation of the gridded-based snow water information.},

Four combinations composed of critical predictor variables were used to train the RF model. Then, we utilized three validation datasets from out-of-bag (OOB) samples, a temporal subset, and a spatiotemporal subset to verify the fitted RF algorithms. The results indicated the following: (1) the accuracy of the RF model is greatly influenced by geographic location, elevation, and land cover fractions; (2) however, the redundant predictor variables (if highly correlated) slightly affect the RF model; and (3) the fitted RF algorithms perform better on temporal than spatial scales, with unbiased root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of {$\sim$}4.4 and {$\sim$}7.3\&thinsp;cm, respectively. Finally, we used the fitted RF2 algorithm to retrieve a consistent 32-year daily snow depth dataset from 1987 to 2018. This product was evaluated against the independent station observations during the period 1987{\textendash}2018. The mean unbiased RMSE and bias were 7.1 and -0.05\&thinsp;cm, respectively, indicating better performance than that of the former snow depth dataset (8.4 and -1.20\&thinsp;cm) from the Environmental and Ecological Science Data Center for West China (WESTDC). Although the RF product was superior to the WESTDC dataset, it still underestimated deep snow cover (\&gt;20\&thinsp;cm), with biases of -10.4, -8.9, and -34.1\&thinsp;cm for northeast China (NEC), northern Xinjiang (XJ), and the Qinghai{\textendash}Tibetan Plateau (QTP), respectively. Additionally, the long-term snow depth datasets (station observations, RF estimates, and WESTDC product) were analyzed in terms of temporal and spatial variations over China. On a temporal scale, the ground truth snow depth presented a significant increasing trend from 1987 to 2018, especially in NEC. However, the RF and WESTDC products displayed no significant changing trends except on the QTP. The WESTDC product presented a significant decreasing trend on the QTP, with a correlation coefficient of -0.55, whereas there were no significant trends for ground truth observations and the RF product. For the spatial characteristics, similar trend patterns were observed for RF and WESTDC products over China. These characteristics presented significant decreasing trends in most areas and a significant increasing trend in central NEC.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The proposed approach pivots on global climate models and their downscaled simulation data for future climate prediction. For scour hazard analysis, the climate simulation data are converted to flow discharge data using hydrologic modeling. As future climates involve considerable uncertainties, different climate futures and global climate models are considered. In addition, long-term regional analyses are adopted to reduce these uncertainties. The proposed approach is applied to bridges over the Lehigh River in the Lehigh River watershed. With data from various public databases, the long-term regional risk of bridge scour is assessed using various global climate models under three climate change scenarios. The impact of climate change on bridge scour risk is quantified in monetary terms. The proposed approach and the obtained results provide an important basis for the planning of climate adaptation actions for river bridges.},

  abstract = {Abstract. High-Asia glaciers have been observed to be retreating the fastest in the southeastern Tibet Plateau (SETP), where vast numbers of glaciers and amounts of snow feed the streamflow of the Brahmaputra, a transboundary river linking the world's two most populous countries, China and India. However, the low temporal resolutions in previous observations of glacier and snow (GS) mass balance obscured the seasonal accumulation{\textendash}ablation variations, and their modelling estimates were divergent. Here we use monthly satellite gravimetry observations from August~2002 to June~2017 to estimate GS mass variation in the SETP. We find that the ``spring-accumulation-type'' glaciers and snow in the SETP reach their maximum in May. This is in stark contrast to seasonal variations in terrestrial water storage, which is controlled by summer precipitation and reaches the maximum in August. These two seasonal variations are mutually orthogonal and can be easily separated in time-variable gravity observations. Our GS mass balance results show a long-term trend of -6.5{$\pm$}0.8\,Gt\,yr-1 (or 0.67{$\pm$}0.08\,m\,w.e.\,yr-1) and annual mass decreases ranging from -49.3 to -78.3\,Gt with an average of -64.5{$\pm$}8.9\,Gt in the SETP between August~2002 and June~2017. The contribution of summer meltwater to the Brahmaputra streamflow is estimated to be 51{$\pm$}9\,Gt. This result could help to resolve previous divergent modelling estimates and underlines the importance of meltwater to the Brahmaputra streamflow. The high sensitivity between GS melting and temperature on both annual and monthly scales suggests that the Brahmaputra will suffer from not only changes in total annual discharge but also an earlier runoff peak due to ongoing global warming.},

Specifically, a novel terrain-guided flatten memory network (abbreviated as TIGAM) with axial similarity constraint is proposed. TIGAM consists of three elaborately designed blocks, i.e., the similarity block, the reconstruction block, and the denoise block. To achieve long-spatial dependence, the similarity block interpolates low-resolution data to high resolution in an axial attention manner. Meanwhile, the reconstruction block aims to obtain a clearer high-resolution representation in closed form. Taking both of the meteorological prior and network design principle into consideration, this article also proposes a flatten memory module with learnable input for high-resolution denoising. Furthermore, for accurate detail reconstruction, a terrain-guided enhanced loss is presented benefitting from the high-resolution remote sensing data. This loss function integrates wind spatial distribution and terrain elegantly. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TIGAM.},

However, its performance in monitoring lakes/reservoirs has rarely been assessed. Here, we report an accuracy evaluation of the ICESat-2 laser altimetry data over 30 reservoirs in China using gauge data. To show its characteristics in large-scale lake monitoring, we also applied an advanced radar altimeter SARAL (Satellite for ARgos and ALtika) and the first laser altimeter ICESat (Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite) to investigate all lakes and reservoirs ({$>$}10 km2) in China. We found that the ICESat-2 has a greatly improved altimetric capability, and the relative altimetric error was 0.06 m, while the relative altimetric error was 0.25 m for SARAL. Compared with SARAL and ICESat data, ICESat-2 data had the lowest measurement uncertainty (the standard deviation of along-track heights; 0.02 m vs. 0.17 m and 0.07 m), the greatest temporal frequency (3.43 vs. 1.35 and 1.48 times per year), and the second greatest lake coverage (636 vs. 814 and 311 lakes). The precise LSH profiles derived from the ICESat-2 data showed that most lakes (90\% of 636 lakes) had a quasi-horizontal LSH profile (measurement uncertainty {$<$}0.05 m), and special methods are needed for mountainous lakes or shallow lakes to extract precise LSHs.},

The data showed the response of the Ku-band radar echoes to snowpack changes for various types of background vegetation in the study site in north central Colorado. We observed about 0.15-0.5-dB increases in backscatter for every 1 cm of snow-water-equivalent (SWE) accumulation for areas with short vegetation (sagebrush and pasture). The region with the smaller amount of biomass, signified by the backscatter in November, seemed to have the stronger backscatter response to SWE in decibels. The data also showed the impact of surface hoar growth and freeze/thaw cycles, which created large snow-grain sizes, ice crust layers, and ice lenses and consequently increased the radar signals by a few decibels. The copolarized HH/VV backscatter ratio seems to indicate double-bounce scattering between the ground surface and snow or vegetation. The cross-polarized backscatter [vertical-horizontal (VH)] showed not only the influence of vegetation but also the strong response to snow accumulation. The observed HV/VV ratio suggests the importance of multiple scattering or nonspherical scattering geometry of snow grain in the dense-media radiative transfer scattering model.

  abstract = {Most of the excess energy stored in the climate system due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions has been taken up by the oceans, leading to thermal expansion and sea-level rise. The oceans thus have an important role in the Earth's energy imbalance. Observational constraints on future anthropogenic warming critically depend on accurate estimates of past ocean heat content (OHC) change. We present a reconstruction of OHC since 1871, with global coverage of the full ocean depth. Our estimates combine timeseries of observed sea surface temperatures with much longer historical coverage than those in the ocean interior together with a representation (a Green's function) of time-independent ocean transport processes. For 1955{\textendash}2017, our estimates are comparable with direct estimates made by infilling the available 3D time-dependent ocean temperature observations. We find that the global ocean absorbed heat during this period at a rate of 0.30 {$\pm$} 0.06 W/                                                                                               m                                                                 2                                                                                       in the upper 2,000 m and 0.028 {$\pm$} 0.026 W/                                                                                               m                                                                 2                                                                                       below 2,000 m, with large decadal fluctuations.

  abstract = {In recent years, land surface temperature (LST) has become critical in environmental studies and earth science. Remote sensing technology enables spatiotemporal monitoring of this parameter on large scales. This parameter can be estimated by satellite images with at least one thermal band. Sentinel-3 SLSTR data provide LST products with a spatial resolution of 1 km. In this research, direct and indirect validation procedures were employed to evaluate the Sentinel-3 SLSTR LST products over the study area in different seasons from 2018 to 2019. The validation method was based on the absolute (direct) evaluation of this product with field data and comparison (indirect) evaluation with the MODIS LST product and the estimated LST using the non-linear split-window (NSW) algorithm. Also, two emissivity estimation methods, (1) NDVI thresholding method (NDVI-THM) and (2) classification-based emissivity method (CBEM), were used to estimate the LST using the NSW method according to the two thermal bands of Sentinel-3 images. Then, the accuracy of these methods in estimating LST was evaluated using field data and temporal changes of vegetation, which the NDVI-THM method generated better results. For indirect evaluation between the Sentinel-3 LST product, MODIS LST product, and LST estimated using NSW, four filters based on spatial and temporal separates between pairs of pixels and pixel quality were used to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the compared pairs of a pixel. In general, the accuracy results of the LST products of MODIS and Sentinel-3, and LST estimated using NSW showed a similar trend for LST changes during the seasons. With respect to the two absolute and comparative validations for the Sentinel-3 LST products, summer with the highest values of bias ({\`A}1.24 K), standard deviation (StDv = 2.66 K), and RMSE (2.43 K), and winter with the lowest ones (bias of 0.14 K, StDv of 1.13 K, and RMSE of 1.12 K) provided the worst and best results for the seasons in the period of 2018{\textendash}2019, respectively. According to both absolute and comparative evaluation results, the Sentinel-3 SLSTR LST products provided reliable results for all seasons on a large temporal and spatial scale over our studied area. {\'O} 2021 COSPAR.

  abstract = {Although the traditional water-level observation has been improved by wide application of satellite altimetry, the acquisition of fully-covered, long-term water level is impeded by the inadequacies of radar/laser altimetry sensors. Alternatively, the water level of lakes in various sizes can be obtained by combining multitemporal lake shorelines and superimposed topographic information [e.g., digital elevation model (DEM)]. However, the quantification and reduction approach of the uncertainty of water levels reconstructed from the topographic data remains largely unexplored. Therefore, this study aims to develop an improved DEM-based method for reconstructing long-term water levels for ungauged lakes. Before this, we first assessed the characteristics of vertical height uncertainties of DEMs varying with topographic slopes. Assessment results for DEM evaluated based on ICESat-2 show that higher spatial resolution DEMs (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM and AW3D DEM) achieve a higher vertical accuracy with the mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.67 and 3.46 m, respectively, while the mean error will decrease to 1.8 m upon the slope below 1‚ó¶. Our study confirms that terrain relief exerts strong influences on the DEM data quality. As the DEMs show higher error in steeper terrain, the proposed method first selects the lake bank sites at gentle slopes as the virtual stations and then reconstructs water-level series by superimposing lake shorelines over DEMs at the virtual stations. Results revealed that the reconstructed lake levels show strong correlations with the Hydroweb water level from altimetry data with an R2 close to 0.90. Furthermore, we found that unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-based DEM is expected to have much better performance in the virtual station method.},

Moreover, a self-adaptive threshold based on the histogram of height differences is employed to identify the terrain changes automatically, which are the fundamental data for landslide assessment. The results of simulated experiments illustrate the robustness and accuracy of the new algorithm.},

These models' performances were verified by comparing historical global near-surface wind speed and downward surface solar radiation over land. Compared to the baseline historical period 1985{\textendash}2005, the distribution of relative projected changes in global wind and solar resources had great spatial and seasonal discrepancies. Under both climate scenarios, projected wind resources throughout the 21st century presented a decreasing trend in Asia and Europe but an increasing trend in the low-latitude Americas. In comparison, projected global solar resources over land generally showed an increasing trend throughout the 21st century, especially in Europe, eastern Asia, and eastern North America. Moreover, wind resources in the Americas had their most significant decrease and increase in January and July, respectively, while in Asia and Europe the decreasing trend as most prominent in January and October, respectively. The most significant increases in solar resources in the Americas, Asia, and Europe happened in October and July, respectively. Discrepancies between the variation trends of future global wind and solar resources suggest the complexity and nonlinearity of these resources' responses to future climate change.},

  abstract = {With the rapidly increasing complexity of operational challenges in smart grid environment, the traditional load point forecasting methods are no longer adequate. Probabilistic load forecasting has been proven to be more suitable in these environments due to their superior ability to provide more advanced uncertainty quantification. Most of the probabilistic forecasting methods, however are either insufficiently accurate or take very long training time. While probabilistic forecasting using quantile forecasts has been popular in research, the industry has been adopting another form of probabilistic forecasts, namely prediction intervals (PIs). The direct PI construction (DPIC) method typically employed for deciding the corresponding upper and lower quantile pair in PIs, however cannot guarantee the reliability of constructed PIs. This paper not only proposes a parallel and improved load quantile forecasting method but also solves the reliability issue of DPIC by proposing an alternative quantile determination (QD) method. Case studies show that the proposed load quantile forecasting method is both more accurate and more computationally efficient than the state-of-the-art methods and the reliability issue of DPIC is considerably alleviated by QD.},

Mapping of flood risk requires quantification of the error in DEM elevations and its effect on delineation of flood zones. The ASTER, SRTM, ALOS, and TanDEM-X (TDX) DEMs for the island of Hispaniola were examined by comparing them with GPS and LiDAR measurements. The comparisons were based on a series of error measures including root mean square error (RMSE) and absolute error at 90\% quantile (LE90). When compared with {$>$} 2000 GPS measurements with elevations below 7 m, RMSE and LE90 values for ASTER, SRTM, ALOS, TDX DEMs were 8.44 and 14.29, 3.82 and 5.85, 2.08 and 3.64, and 1.74 and 3.20 m, respectively. In contrast, RMSE and LE90 values for the same DEMs were 4.24 and 6.70, 4.81 and 7.16, 4.91 and 6.82, and 2.27 and 3.66 m when compared to DEMs from 150 km2 LiDAR data, which included elevations as high as 20 m. The expanded area with LiDAR coverage included additional types of land surface, resulting in differences in error measures. Comparison of RMSEs indicated that the filtering of TDX DEMs using four methods improved the accuracy of the estimates of ground elevation by 20{\textendash}43\%. DTMs generated by interpolating the ground pixels from a progressive morphological filter, using an empirical Bayesian kriging method, produced an RMSE of 1.06 m and LE90 of 1.73 m when compared to GPS measurements, and an RMSE of 1.30 m and LE90 of 2.02 m when compared to LiDAR data. Differences in inundation areas based on TDX and LiDAR DTMs were between -13\% and -4\% for scenarios of 3, 5, 10, and 15 m water level rise, a much narrower range than inundation differences between ASTER, SRTM, ALOS and LiDAR. The TDX DEMs deliver high resolution global DEMs with unprecedented elevation accuracy, hence, it is recommended for mapping coastal flood risk zones on a global scale, as well as at a local scale in developing countries where data with higher accuracy are unavailable.},

In this paper, we investigated the variations of 25 lakes in five sub-regions on the Tibetan Plateau from 1972 to 2019 based on SRTM DEM data and Landsat imagery. We used a method to derive lake-levels based on DEM and lake boundaries delineated from Landsat imagery, and then calculated the changes in lake area, level, and volume in 1972 to 2019. We also analyzed the potential impacts of temperature, precipitation, glacial and permafrost melting in lake changes during this period. The results show that the lakes tended to shrink until 2010 in southern and western plateau, after which they began to expand gradually but the overall trend is still shrinking. Limited meltwater from glaciers and permafrost and low precipitation are the main reasons for their shrinkage. The lakes in the central plateau, northwest plateau and northeast plateau tend to expand overall. The reason for the expansion of the lakes is not only precipitation but also the melting of glaciers and permafrost. Overall, the lake changes have gone through 3 phases, namely a slight decrease during 1972{\textendash}2000, a rapid increase during 2000{\textendash}2010, and a slowdown in the last decade (2010{\textendash}2019). Multiple factors such as temperature, precipitation, the state of glaciers and permafrost have contributed to the changes in the lake.},

  abstract = {With the development of photon-counting sensors, spaceborne photon-counting lidars have shown many ad\- vantages in mapping underwater topography. Although a space based lidar is normally a profiling system, the depth penetration and the vertical accuracy achieved with a bathymetric lidar is superior to imagery (that only provides relative depths). Therefore, many satellite derived bathymetry products use both active/passive spaceborne data to achieve spatial coverage as well as absolute depth measurements. Compared with shipborne and airborne bathymetric systems, satellite derived bathymetry data can have a global coverage, especially covering some remote areas where airborne/shipborne systems are hard or very expensive to reach. In this paper, a theoretical model is proposed to quantitatively analyze the maximum bathymetric depth of a satellite photoncounting lidar, which considers the system parameters, environmental effects, and the constraint of the SNR (signal to noise ratio). System parameters of ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2) as well as the MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Pre\- diction) datasets are used to provide systematic and environmental inputs to the model, and the ICESat-2 actual bathymetric data are used to verify the maximum depth estimated by the proposed model. In six different sites with different water qualities, solar angles and wind speeds, the theoretical maximum bathymetric depths agree well with the actually achieved ICESat-2 lidar depths, in terms of MAE (mean absolute error) of 0.50 m and the RMSE (root mean square error) of 0.60 m. The errors in all study areas are within 14\% of the corresponding maximum depths. Additionally, the non-linear response of a photon-counting lidar, independent parameter impacts on the theoretical model, and the errors in the experimental process were quantitatively analyzed. In the future, this theoretical model can be used to evaluate the maximum bathymetric depth for a bathymetry investigation when applying system parameters and environmental parameters. In addition, it can be used to optimize the hardware parameters of a photon-counting lidar in its early design process.},

  abstract = {The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm and its variants are a fundamental technique for rigid registration between two point sets, with wide applications in different areas from robotics to 3D reconstruction. The main drawbacks for ICP are its slow convergence as well as its sensitivity to outliers, missing data, and partial overlaps. Recent work such as Sparse ICP achieves robustness via sparsity optimization at the cost of computational speed. In this paper, we propose a new method for robust registration with fast convergence. First, we show that the classical point-to-point ICP can be treated as a majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm, and propose an Anderson acceleration approach to speed up its convergence. In addition, we introduce a robust error metric based on the Welsch's function, which is minimized efficiently using the MM algorithm with Anderson acceleration. On challenging datasets with noises and partial overlaps, we achieve similar or better accuracy than Sparse ICP while being at least an order of magnitude faster. Finally, we extend the robust formulation to point-to-plane ICP, and solve the resulting problem using a similar Anderson-accelerated MM strategy. Our robust ICP methods improve the registration accuracy on benchmark datasets while being competitive in computational time.},

  abstract = {Under a warming climate, an improved understanding of the water stored in snowpacks is becoming increasingly important for hydropower planning, flood risk assessment and water resource management. Due to inaccessibility and a lack of ground measurement networks, accurate quantification of snow water storage in mountainous terrains still remains a major challenge. Remote sensing can provide dynamic observations with extensive spatial coverage, and has proved a useful means to characterize snow water equivalent (SWE) at a large scale. However, current SWE products show very low quality in the mountainous areas due to very coarse spatial resolution, complex terrain, large spatial heterogeneity and deep snow. With more high-quality satellite data becoming available from the development of satellite sensors and platforms, it provides more opportunities for better estimation of snow conditions. Meanwhile, machine learning provides an important technique for handling the big data offered from remote sensing. Using the {\"O}veruman Catchment in Northern Sweden as a case study, this paper explores the potentials of machine learning for improving the estimation of mountain snow water storage using satellite observations, topographic factors, land cover information and ground SWE measurements from the spatially distributed snow survey. The results show that significantly improved SWE estimation close to the peak of snow accumulation can be achieved in the catchment using the random forest regression. This study demonstrates the potentials of machine learning for better understanding the snow water storage in mountainous areas.},

  abstract = {Satellite remote sensing of near real-time reservoir storage variations has important implications for flood monitoring and water resources management. However, satellite altimetry data, which are essential for estimating storage variations, are only available for a limited number of reservoirs. This lack of high-density spatial coverage directly hinders the potential use of remotely sensed reservoir information for improving the skills of hydrological modeling over highly regulated river basins. To solve this problem, a reservoir storage dataset with high-density spatial coverage was developed by combining the water surface area estimated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imageries with the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data collected by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). By including more reservoirs, this reservoir dataset represents 46.6\% of the overall storage capacity in South Asia. The results were validated over five reservoirs where gauge observations are accessible. The storage estimates agree well with observations, with coefficients of determination ranging from 0.47 to 0.91 and normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE) ranging from 15.46\% to 37.69\%. Given the general availability of MODIS and SRTM data, this algorithm can be potentially applied for monitoring global reservoirs at a high density.},

While the conventional footprint suppression methods have the difficulty of removing 3-D footprint noise without losing any geological structure. I present a 2-D image processing of Basis Pursuit Denoising (BPDN) on vertical and horizontal seismic data to remove the 2-D footprint. The BPDN aims at reconstructing the signal with a reduced number of measurements. The reconstruction procedure can keep the signal consistent at a noise level. Applied this way, the seismic volume retains the geological structure with footprint noise suppressed and without inducing any artifact.},

  abstract = {Ocean bottom node (OBN) acquisition can yield high quality images, but it is expensive. By using random sampling and compressive sensing, one may maintain a similar resolution in images by using fewer OBNs, or obtain higher-resolution images from the same number of OBNs. By arranging OBNs randomly, a sparse under-sampled volume is acquired, and we can then reconstruct the seismic data by using compressive sensing after acquisition. We present a direct reconstruction method of seismic data using compressive sensing based on random samples, which is also applicable to sparse OBNs. This method can be combined with any sparse transform and optimization algorithm. We also have found that the accuracy of the reconstruction is related to the random patterns of the OBN volume's sampling positions. We can obtain better reconstruction results by dividing the available samples into subsets, each of which has a more random pattern. As a result, this method can lead to both accurate and efficient reconstruction of OBN seismic data. The application to a field seismic volume shows that we can produce more accurate result by using subsets of samples in time slices whose randomness is given by the positions of OBNs. This direct reconstruction method of seismic data and the understanding regarding the roles played by the randomness of OBN positions may lead to more efficient and cost-effective seismic acquisition approaches.},

  abstract = {Inland open water bodies often pose a systematic error source in the passive remote sensing retrievals of soil moisture. Water temperature is a necessary variable used to compute water emissions that is required to be subtracted from satellite observation to yield actual emissions from the land portion, which in turn generates accurate soil moisture retrievals. Therefore, overestimation of soil moisture can often be corrected using concurrent water temperature data in the overall mitigation procedure. In recent years, several data sets of lake water temperature have become available, but their specifications and accuracy have rarely been investigated in the context of passive soil moisture remote sensing on a global scale. For this reason, three lake temperature products were evaluated against in-situ measurements from 2007 to 2011. The data sets include the lake surface water temperature (LSWT) from Global Observatory of Lake Responses to Environmental Change (GloboLakes), the Copernicus Global Land Operations Cryosphere and Water (C-GLOPS), as well as the lake mix-layer temperature (LMLT) from the European Centers for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) ERA5 Land Reanalysis. GloboLakes, C-GLOPS, and ERA5 Land have overall comparable performance with Pearson correlations (R) of 0.87, 0.92 and 0.88 in comparison with in-situ measurements. LSWT products exhibit negative median biases of -0.27 K (GloboLakes) and -0.31 K (C-GLOPS), whereas the median bias of LMLT is 1.56 K. When mapped from their respective native resolutions to a common 9 km Equal-Area Scalable Earth (EASE) Grid 2.0 projection, similar relative performance was observed. LMLT and LSWT data are closer in performance over the 9 km grid cells that exhibit a small range of lake cover fractions (0.05{\textendash}0.5). Despite comparable relative performance, ERA5 Land shows great advantages in spatial coverage and temporal resolution. In summary, an integrated evaluation on data accuracy, long-term availability, global coverage, temporal resolution, and regular forward processing with modest data latency led us to conclude that LMLT from the ERA5 Land Reanalysis product represents the most optimal path for use in the development of a long-term soil moisture product.},

Lake level change is an important indicator to reflect changes of climate and environment in a certain area. The development of satellite altimetry has provided data support for the monitoring of lake level and effectively compensated for the deficiencies of traditional water level monitoring in alpine regions. In this study, the laser altimeter of ICESat-2 and the radar altimeter of CryoSat-2 are used to provide lake level of the Nam Co lake during the period of 2010-2020. The result showed that the standard deviation (SD) of ICESat2 (0.0895m) was lower than the SD of CryoSat-2 (0.2556m) and the months with higher SD values were mostly during the ice period of Nam Co lake. ICESat-2 had a considerably decreased measurement uncertainty. There are systematic differences in lake levels extracted by different altimetry satellites and the mean bias between ICESat-2 and CryoSat-2 was around 0.45m. After removing interaltimeter biases, the continuous lake levels from 2010 to 2020 were constructed. The inter-annual changes in lake levels were flat or even slightly decreased and the lake level has dropped by about 0.80 m in general. The water level generally reached the highest from September to October of the year in terms of intra-annual changes. Besides, temperature and precipitation changes were closely related to lake level tendency.},

We used airborne light detection and ranging measurements from four sites in the southern Sierra Nevada to determine how snow depth varies with canopy structure and the interactions between canopies and terrain. We processed the point clouds into snow depth rasters at 0.5{\texttimes}0.5-m2 resolution and performed statistical analysis on the processed snow depth data, terrain attributes, and vegetation attributes, including the individual tree bole locations, canopy crown area, and canopy height. We studied the snow depth at such a fine scale due in part to the spatial heterogeneity introduced by canopy interception and enhanced melting caused by tree trunks in forested areas. We found that the dominant direction of a tree well, the area around the tree bole that has shallower snowpack, is correlated with the local aspect of the terrain, and the gradient of the snow surface in a tree well is correlated with the tree's crown area. The regression-tree based XGBoost model was fitted with the topographic variables and canopy variables, and about 71\% of snow depth variability can be explained by the model.},

Simulated snow depths have low accuracy (RMSE = 17{\textendash}36 cm) and are biased high, exceeding the observed baseline (1976{\textendash}2005) on average (18 {$\pm$} 16 cm) across the study area. Spatial climatological patterns based on observations are modestly reproduced by the models (normalized root-mean-square deviations of 0.77 {$\pm$} 0.20). Observed snow depth during the cold season increased by about 2.0 cm over the study period, which is approximately 11\% relative to the baseline. The models reproduce decreasing snow depth trends that contradict the observations, but they all indicate a precipitation increase during the cold season. The modeled snow depths are insensitive to precipitation but too sensitive to air temperature; these inaccurate sensitivities could explain the discrepancies between the observed and simulated snow depth trends. Based on our findings, we recommend caution when using and interpreting simulated changes in snow depth and associated impacts.},

  abstract = {Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is a popular geophysical subsurfaceimaging technique and widely applied to mineral prospecting, hydrological exploration, environmental investigation and civil engineering, as well as archaeological mapping. This chapter offers an overall review of technical aspects of ERT, which includes the fundamental theory of direct-current (DC) resistivity exploration, electrode arrays for data acquisition, numerical modelling methods and tomographic inversion algorithms. The section of fundamental theory shows basic formulae and principle of DC resistivity exploration. The section of electrode arrays summarises the previous study on all traditional-electrode arrays and recommends 4 electrode arrays for data acquisition of surface ERT and 3 electrode arrays for cross-hole ERT. The section of numerical modelling demonstrates an advanced version of finite-element method, called Gaussian quadrature grid approach, which is advantageous to a numerical simulation of ERT for complex geological models. The section of tomographic inversion presents the generalised standard conjugate gradient algorithms for both the l1- and l2-normed inversions. After that, some synthetic and real imaging examples are given to show the near-surface imaging capabilities of ERT.},

  abstract = {We present an algorithm for fast global registration of partially overlapping 3D surfaces. The algorithm operates on candidate matches that cover the surfaces. A single objective is optimized to align the surfaces and disable false matches. The objective is defined densely over the surfaces and the optimization achieves tight alignment with no initialization. No correspondence updates or closest-point queries are performed in the inner loop. An extension of the algorithm can perform joint global registration of many partially overlapping surfaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the presented approach matches or exceeds the accuracy of state-of-the-art global registration pipelines, while being at least an order of magnitude faster. Remarkably, the presented approach is also faster than local refinement algorithms such as ICP. It provides the accuracy achieved by well-initialized local refinement algorithms, without requiring an initialization and at lower computational cost.},

  abstract = {In this study, we compare eight recently developed snow depth products over Arctic sea ice, which use satellite observations, modeling, or a combination of satellite and modeling approaches. These products are further compared against various ground-truth observations, including those from ice mass balance observations and airborne measurements. Large mean snow depth discrepancies are observed over the Atlantic and Canadian Arctic sectors. The differences between climatology and the snow products early in winter could be in part a result of the delaying in Arctic ice formation that reduces early snow accumulation, leading to shallower snowpacks at the start of the freeze-up season. These differences persist through spring despite overall more winter snow accumulation in the reanalysis-based products than in the climatologies. Among the products evaluated, the University of Washington (UW) snow depth product produces the deepest spring (March{\textendash}April) snowpacks, while the snow product from the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) provides the shallowest spring snow depths. Most snow products show significant correlation with snow depths retrieved from Operational IceBridge (OIB) while correlations are quite low against buoy measurements, with no correlation and very low variability from University of Bremen and DMI products. Inconsistencies in reconstructed snow depth among the products, as well as differences between these products and in situ and airborne observations, can be partially attributed to differences in effective footprint and spatial{\textendash}temporal coverage, as well as insufficient observations for validation/bias adjustments. Our results highlight the need for more targeted Arctic surveys over different spatial and temporal scales to allow for a more systematic comparison and fusion of airborne, in situ and remote sensing observations.},

  abstract = {Aerial robots are widely deployed, but highly cluttered environments such as dense forests remain inaccessible to drones and even more so to swarms of drones. In these scenarios, previously unknown surroundings and narrow corridors combined with requirements of swarm coordination can create challenges. To enable swarm navigation in the wild, we develop miniature but fully autonomous drones with a trajectory planner that can function in a timely and accurate manner based on limited information from onboard sensors. The planning problem satisfies various task requirements including flight efficiency, obstacle avoidance, and inter-robot collision avoidance, dynamical feasibility, swarm coordination, and so on, thus realizing an extensible planner. Furthermore, the proposed planner deforms trajectory shapes and adjusts time allocation synchronously based on spatial-temporal joint optimization. A high-quality trajectory thus can be obtained after exhaustively exploiting the solution space within only a few milliseconds, even in the most constrained environment. The planner is finally integrated into the developed palm-sized swarm platform with onboard perception, localization, and control. Benchmark comparisons validate the superior performance of the planner in trajectory quality and computing time. Various real-world field experiments demonstrate the extensibility of our system. Our approach evolves aerial robotics in three aspects: capability of cluttered environment navigation, extensibility to diverse task requirements, and coordination as a swarm without external facilities.},

In this paper, we present RACER, a RApid Collaborative ExploRation approach using a fleet of decentralized UAVs. To effectively dispatch the UAVs, a pairwise interaction based on an online hgrid space decomposition is used. It ensures that all UAVs simultaneously explore distinct regions, using only asynchronous and limited communication. Further, we optimize the coverage paths of unknown space and balance the workloads partitioned to each UAV with a Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem(CVRP) formulation. Given the task allocation, each UAV constantly updates the coverage path and incrementally extracts crucial information to support the exploration planning. A hierarchical planner finds exploration paths, refines local viewpoints and generates minimum-time trajectories in sequence to explore the unknown space agilely and safely. The proposed approach is evaluated extensively, showing high exploration efficiency, scalability and robustness to limited communication. Furthermore, for the first time, we achieve fully decentralized collaborative exploration with multiple UAVs in real world. We will release our implementation as an open-source package.},

  abstract = {The Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), a new spaceborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system, was successfully launched on September 15, 2018. The ICESat-2 data increase the types of spaceborne LiDAR data archive and provide new control point data for large-scale topographic mapping and geodetic surveying. However, the accuracy of the ATL08 terrain estimates has not been fully evaluated on a large scale and in complex terrain conditions. This article aims to quantitatively assess the accuracy of ICESat-2 ATL08 terrain estimates. Firstly, the ICESat-2 ATL08 terrain estimates were compared with the high-precision airborne LiDAR digital terrain model (DTM), and impacts of acquisition time, vegetation cover type, terrain slope, and season change on the terrain estimation accuracy were analyzed. We get the following conclusions from the analysis: 1) the mean and RMSE of the terrain estimates of day acquisitions are 0.22 m and 0.59 m higher than that of night acquisitions; 2) the accuracy of the ATL08 terrain estimates acquired in vegetated areas is lower than those in non-vegetated areas; 3) the accuracy of the ATL08 terrain estimates is inversely proportional to the slope, and the elevation error increases significantly when the terrain slope is larger than 30{$^\circ$}; 4) in the non-vegetation covered area, the accuracy of the ATL08 terrain estimates of summer and winter acquisitions has no obvious discrepancy, but in vegetated area, the accuracy of winter acquisitions is significantly better than that of summer acquisitions. This research provides references for the selection and application of ICESat-2 data.},

  abstract = {Radar images with high spatial resolution are not affected by illumination or meteorological conditions, which effectively compensate for the shortcomings of optical images and passive microwave images. Thus, active microwave remote sensing technology has advantages in snow depth (SD) research. Machine learning algorithms (MLAs), which do not need to consider complex physical models, have increasingly been applied to SD research. Considering the snow conditions of different underlying surfaces, it is very important to select the appropriate parameter combinations (PC) reflecting the SD information for MLAs. In this study, C-band SAR data with 20 m spatial resolution, ground-based SD observation data from meteorological stations, and field measurement data in Northeast China were used to construct and validate the SD estimation method. Two parameter selection methods including the correlation coefficient method and the machine learning (ML) fusion method were proposed to discuss the influence of different PC on SD estimation. Then, XGBoost, random forest (RF), linear support vector regression (LSVR), and kernel support vector regression (KSVR) were applied to estimate SD based on the selected PC, and evaluate the accuracies of SD estimation using different MLAs. The results demonstrated that the PC selected using the correlation coefficient method and XGBoost algorithm could achieve the best SD results in the study area. Combining RPC-C with XGBoost algorithm, in cropland areas, the average values of mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) were 1.75 and 2.58 cm, respectively. Combining RPC-F with XGBoost algorithm, in forest areas, the average values of MAE and RMSE were 3.12 and 5.07 cm, respectively. The research of this letter can select the optimal PC for MLAs and effectively improve the accuracy of SD estimation using C-band SAR data.},

  abstract = {How climate change will affect overwintering crops is largely unknown due to the complex and understudied interactions among temperature, rainfall and snowpack. Increases in average winter temperature should release cold limitations yet warming-induced reductions of snowpack thickness should lead to decreased insulation effects and more exposure to freezing. Here, using statistical models, we show that the presence of snowpack weakens yield sensitivity to freezing stress by 22\% during 1999{\textendash}2019. By 2080{\textendash}2100, we project that reduced snow cover insulation will offset up to one-third of the yield benefit (8.8\,{$\pm$}\,1.1\% for RCP\,4.5 and 11.8\,{$\pm$}\,1.4\% for RCP\,8.5) from reduced frost stress across the United States. Furthermore, by 2080{\textendash}2100 future decline in wheat growing season snowfall (source of snowmelt) will drive a yield loss greater than the yield benefit from increasing rainfall. Explicitly considering these factors is critical to predict the climate change impacts on winter wheat production in snowy regions.},

  abstract = {Extreme precipitation events have caused severe societal, economic and environmental impacts through the disasters of floods, flash-floods and landslides. However, the coarse-resolution of satellite-derived precipitation data makes it difficult to quantitatively capture certain fine-scale heavy rainfall process. Therefore, to improve the spatial resolution and accuracy of satellite-based precipitation extremes, a downscaling-calibration scheme based on eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost\_DC) was proposed in this study, where the XGBoost algorithm was applied in both downscaling and calibration procedures. The performance of XGBoost\_DC was evaluated with other two comparative methods, in which XGBoost was only used in either downscaling (XGBoost\_Spline) or calibration (Spline\_XGBoost) process. The results showed that: (i) XGBoost\_DC achieved the best performance, as it obtained the highest accuracy and well reproduced the occurrence and the spatial distribution of precipitation during typhoon events. (ii) XGBoost\_DC could capture the spatial variations of the precipitation. Although Spline\_XGBoost obtained results only slightly worse than the XGBoost\_DC, it significantly underestimated the spatial variability. (iii) the model assessment between the XGBoost\_DC and Spline\_XGBoost illustrated the essential contribution of XGBoost algorithm in downscaling process, and improved our understanding of the capability of machine learning algorithm in reproducing spatial variance of precipitation. These findings imply that our proposed downscaling-calibration scheme can be applied for generating high-resolution and high-quality precipitation extremes during typhoon events, which would benefit the water and flood management, as well as other various applications in hydrological and meteorological modelling.},

  abstract = {Accurate high-spatial-resolution precipitation is significantly important in hydrological and meteorological modelling, especially in rain-gauge-sparse areas. Some methods and strategies have been applied for satellite-based precipitation downscaling, residual correction and precipitation calibration. However, which downscaling scheme can provide reliable high-resolution precipitation efficiently remains unanswered. To address this issue, this study aimed to present a framework combining the machine learning downscaling algorithm and post-process procedures. Firstly, four ML-based models, namely support vector regression, random forest, spatial random forest (SRF) and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were tested for downscaling and compared with conventional downscaling methods. Then, the effectiveness of the residual correction process using ordinary Kriging and the calibration process using the geographical difference analysis (GDA) method was investigated. The results showed that the ML-based methods had better performance than the conventional regression and interpolation approaches. The SRF and XGBoost outperformed others in generating accurate precipitation estimation with a high resolution. The GDA calibration process significantly improved the downscaled results. However, the residual correction process decreased the downscaling performance of the ML-based models. Combining the SRF or XGBoost downscaling algorithm with the GDA calibration method could be a promising downscaling scheme for precipitation data. The scheme could be used to generate high-resolution precipitation, especially in areas urgently requiring data, which would benefit regional water resource management and hydrological disaster prevention.},

  abstract = {We have designed a periodically varying code that can avoid the problem of the local coherency and make the interference distribute uniformly in a given range; hence, it was better at suppressing incoherent interference (blending noise) and preserving coherent useful signals compared with a random dithering code. We have also devised a new form of the iterative method to remove interference generated from the simultaneous source acquisition. In each iteration, we have estimated the interference using the blending operator following the proposed formula and then subtracted the interference from the pseudodeblended data. To further eliminate the incoherent interference and constrain the inversion, the data were then transformed to an auxiliary sparse domain for applying a thresholding operator. During the iterations, the threshold was decreased from the largest value to zero following an exponential function. The exponentially decreasing threshold aimed to gradually pass the deblended data to a more acceptable model subspace. Two numerically blended synthetic data sets and one numerically blended practical field data set from an ocean bottom cable were used to demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed method and the better performance of the periodically varying code over the traditional random dithering code.},

  abstract = {The Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) mission will measure changes in elevation of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets as part of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) of satellites. Time-series of elevation changes will enable determination of the present-day mass balance of the ice sheets, study of associations between observed ice changes and polar climate, and estimation of the present and future contributions of the ice sheets to global sea level rise. Other scientific objectives of ICESat include: global measurements of cloud heights and the vertical structure of clouds and aerosols; precise measurements of land topography and vegetation canopy heights; and measurements of sea ice roughness, sea ice thickness, ocean surface elevations, and surface reflectivity. The Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) on ICESat has a 1064 nm laser channel for surface altimetry and dense cloud heights and a 532 nm lidar channel for the vertical distribution of clouds and aerosols. The predicted accuracy for the surface-elevation measurements is 15 cm, averaged over 60 m diameter laser footprints spaced at 172 m along-track. The orbital altitude will be around 600 km at an inclination of 94{$^\circ$} with a 183-day repeat pattern. The on-board GPS receiver will enable radial orbit determinations to better than 5 cm, and star-trackers will enable footprints to be located to 6 m horizontally. The spacecraft attitude will be controlled to point the laser beam to within{$\pm$}35 m of reference surface tracks at high latitudes. ICESat is designed to operate for 3{\textendash}5 years and should be followed by successive missions to measure ice changes for at least 15 years.},
