  abstract = {The rates of many processes that control rock breakdown into transportable particles are dependent upon rock temperature. In particular, frost-cracking depends largely upon the time spent within a range of subzero temperatures I call the frost cracking window. I present simple analytic solutions, detailed time series of thermal data from a field site, and a numerical model of subsurface temperatures that constrain the expected depth dependence of frost cracking. Analytic solutions using sinusoidal surface temperature histories result in predicted vertical profiles of frost-cracking intensity that depend upon the location of the frost-cracking window within the range of surface temperatures. In some cases, the expected frost cracking intensity decreases monotonically with depth, while in others it displays a distinct maximum at depth. I use hourly temperatures measured over the l-yr interval April 1995 through March 1996, at 8 depths up to 42 em into a granitic bedrock surface in the Laramie Range, Wyoming, to constrain an in situ thermal diffusivity of 1.7 mm? s - I. These temperature histories suggest that frost cracking at this site should decrease monotonically with depth into the rock. I also use this time series of temperatures to calibrate a numerical thermal model in which the top boundary condition is set by a surface radiation balance. The data require both a low albedo of the rock surface (0.1), and a high atmospheric transmissivity (0.9). I then explore the expected near-surface temperatures at other sites by running the model with different annual mean temperatures, latitudes, and slopes. The resulting simulations suggest that at lower mean annual temperatures, as are found in higher latitude and altitude sites, the frost cracking maximum should both amplify and deepen into the subsurface.},

  abstract = {In this article we craft process-specific algorithms that capture climate control of hillslope evolution in order to elucidate the legacy of past climate on present critical zone architecture and topography. Models of hillslope evolution traditionally comprise rock detachment into the mobile layer, mobile regolith transport, and a channel incision or aggradation boundary condition. We extend this system into the deep critical zone by considering a weathering damage zone below the mobile regolith in which rock strength is diminished; the degree of damage conditions the rate of mobile regolith production. We first discuss generic damage profiles in which appropriate length and damage scales govern profile shapes, and examine their dependence upon exhumation rate. We then introduce climate control through the example of rock damage by frost-generated crack growth. We augment existing frost cracking models by incorporating damage rate limitations for long transport distances for water to the freezing front. Finally we link the frost cracking damage model, a mobile regolith production rule in which rock entrainment is conditioned by the damage state of the rock, and a frost creep transport model, to examine the evolution of an interfluve under oscillating climate. Aspect-related differences in mean annual surface temperatures result in differences in bedrock damage rate and mobile regolith transport efficiency, which in turn lead to asymmetries in critical zone architecture and hillslope form (divide migration). In a quasi-steady state hillslope, the lowering rate is uniform, and the damage profile is better developed on north-facing slopes where the frost damage process is most intense. Because the residence times of mobile regolith and weathered bedrock in such landscapes are on the order of 10 to 100 ka, climate cycles over similar timescales result in modulation of transport and damage efficiencies. These lead to temporal variation in mobile regolith thickness, and to corresponding changes in sediment delivery to bounding streams. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The Antarctic Vostok ice core provided compelling evidence of the nature of climate, and of climate feedbacks, over the past 420,000 years. Marine records suggest that the amplitude of climate variability was smaller before that time, but such records are often poorly resolved. Moreover, it is not possible to infer the abundance of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from marine records. Here we report the recovery of a deep ice core from Dome C, Antarctica, that provides a climate record for the past 740,000 years. For the four most recent glacial cycles, the data agree well with the record from Vostok. The earlier period, between 740,000 and 430,000 years ago, was characterized by less pronounced warmth in interglacial periods in Antarctica, but a higher proportion of each cycle was spent in the warm mode. The transition from glacial to interglacial conditions about 430,000 years ago (Termination V) resembles the transition into the present interglacial period in terms of the magnitude of change in temperatures and greenhouse gases, but there are significant differences in the patterns of change. The interglacial stage following Termination V was exceptionally long—28,000 years compared to, for example, the 12,000 years recorded so far in the present interglacial period. Given the similarities between this earlier warm period and today, our results may imply that without human intervention, a climate similar to the present one would extend well into the future.},

They reflect former regions of glacier initiation, and their distribution is, therefore, linked to palaeoclimate. Because of this association, cirques can be analysed for the information they provide about past environments, an approach that has a strong heritage, and has seen resurgence over recent years. This paper provides a critical assessment of what cirques can tell us about past environments, and considers their reliability as palaeoenvironmental proxies. Specific focus is placed on information that can be obtained from consideration of cirque distribution, aspect, altitude, and morphometry. The paper highlights the fact that cirques potentially provide information about the style, duration and intensity of former glaciation, as well as information about past temperatures, precipitation gradients, cloud-cover and wind directions. In all, cirques are considered a valuable source of palaeoenvironmental information (if used judiciously), particularly as they are ubiquitous within formerly glaciated mountain ranges globally, thus making regional or even global scale studies possible. Furthermore, cirques often occupy remote and inaccessible regions where other palaeoenvironmental proxies may be limited or lacking.},

Firstly, we have systematically mapped the occurrence of palsas and peat plateaus in the northernmost county of Norway (Finnmark, ∼\&thinsp;50 000 km\textsuperscript{2}) by manual interpretation of aerial images from 2005 to 2014 at a spatial resolution of 250 m. At this resolution, mires and wetlands with palsas or peat plateaus occur in about 850 km\textsuperscript{2} of Finnmark, with the actual palsas and peat plateaus underlain by permafrost covering a surface area of approximately 110 km\textsuperscript{2}. Secondly, we have quantified the lateral changes of the extent of palsas and peat plateaus for four study areas located along a NW\&ndash;SE transect through Finnmark by utilizing repeat aerial imagery from the 1950s to the 2010s. The results of the lateral changes reveal a total decrease of 33\&ndash;71 \% in the areal extent of palsas and peat plateaus during the study period, with the largest lateral change rates observed in the last decade. However, the results indicate that degradation of palsas and peat plateaus in northern Norway has been a consistent process during the second half of the 20th century and possibly even earlier. Significant rates of areal change are observed in all investigated time periods since the 1950s, and thermokarst landforms observed on aerial images from the 1950s suggest that lateral degradation was already an ongoing process at this time. The results of this study show that lateral erosion of palsas and peat plateaus is an important pathway for permafrost degradation in the sporadic permafrost zone in northern Scandinavia. While the environmental factors governing the rate of erosion are not yet fully understood, we note a moderate increase in air temperature, precipitation and snow depth during the last few decades in the region.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We discuss direct estimation of balanced-budget ELA from mass-balance data for individual glaciers, and indirect estimation of balanced-budget ELA from simple topographic parameters available from the World Glacier Inventory (WGI), i.e. the area-median and maximum and minimum altitudes. Mass balance and ELA for individual glaciers are usually strongly correlated and we calculate balanced-budget ELA from the regression equation linking the two. We then compare balanced-budget ELA with area-median and mid-range altitudes for the 94 glaciers for which we have all the necessary data. The different ELA estimates agree well enough (±82 to ±125 m) to describe geographical variations in ELA and for application of glacier–climate models to glacier inventory data. Mid-range and area-median altitudes are already available for tens of thousands of glaciers in the current WGI and should be evaluated in future inventories.},

In the last deglacial period, the rate of global sea-level rise peaked at more than 4\,cm\,yr−1 during Meltwater Pulse 1A, which coincided with the Bølling warming event some 14,650 years ago. However, the sources of the meltwater have proven elusive, and the contribution from Eurasian ice sheets has been considered negligible. Here, we present a regional carbon-14 calibration curve for the Norwegian Sea and recalibrate marine 14C dates linked to the Eurasian Ice Sheet retreat. We find that marine-based sectors of the Eurasian Ice Sheet collapsed at the Bølling transition and lost an ice volume of 4.5–7.9\,m sea-level equivalents (SLE) over 500 years. During peak melting, 3.3–6.7\,m SLE of ice was lost, potentially explaining up to half of Meltwater Pulse 1A. A mean meltwater flux of 0.2\,Sv over 300 years was injected into the Norwegian Sea and the Arctic Ocean at a time when proxy evidence suggests vigorous Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. Our reconstruction shows that massive marine-based ice sheets can collapse in as little as 300–500 years.},

  abstract = {The interpretation of differentially weathered mountainous areas along the fringes of Pleistocene ice sheets is fundamental for determining ice-sheet behavior and thickness during the last glaciation. Two existing interpretations are either that highly weathered uplands remained as nunataks while freshly eroded troughs held outlet glaciers during the last glaciation or that uplands and lowlands were equally covered by ice, but that it was differentially erosive as a function of its spatially variable basal thermal regime. Cosmogenic radionuclide measurements from 33 bedrock samples and 27 upland erratics from differentially weathered fiord landscapes on northeastern Baffin Island shed light on Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) dynamics and thickness. Tors on weathered upland surfaces have minimum 10Be ages between ca. 50 and ca. 170 ka (n = 12), whereas the majority of erratics perched in the uplands range from ca. 10 to ca. 13 ka (n = 14), indicating that the whole landscape was glaciated during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Glacially sculpted bedrock (n = 7) near sea level reflects the age of deglaciation, and increasing amounts of isotopic inheritance in high-elevation sculpted bedrock (n = 3), higher elevation intermediately weathered bedrock (n = 11), and highest elevation intensely weathered bedrock reflect the weakening of erosive power as the ice sheet transitioned from fiords to interfiord plateaus.Cold-based glaciation of uplands was contemporaneous with warm-based glaciation in fiords, suggesting the presence of ice streams. 26Al and 10Be concentrations measured in 10 bedrock samples indicate that tors have experienced a complex history of alternating periods of exposure, burial, and limited glacial erosion. The paired isotope data reveal a minimum duration of burial of 80–500 k.y., presumably by cold-based ice, and indicate that the tors have an age of at least 150–580 ka. These data, together with other reconstructions of ice streams in the eastern Canadian Arctic, suggest that ice streams were a large influence on northeastern LIS dynamics throughout the late Quaternary. Thus, the northeastern LIS was sensitively tied with North Atlantic thermohaline circulation and abrupt climate change.},

The behavior of this parameter exhibits a distinct periodicity with more internal fluctuations. This overview prompts us to a description of the physical basis of the climate system, capable of explaining such fluctuations. The system is the star-planet, initially described as a lamp-billiard ball simple system. Astronomical causes affect the distance lamp-billiard ball (star-planet) and the ball (Earth) rotation axis orientation, while astronomical causes affect the intensity of radiation emitted from the lamp (Sun). The complication introduced by the atmosphere is then explained, essentially through the triatomic gas molecules, aerosol and clouds. Atmospheric composition affects incoming solar radiation and outgoing infrared one. The compartments relevant for climate definition are examined: lithosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, biosphere including vegetation and humans. However due to space limitations the interactions between the different compartments are not treated here and we restrict ourselves to the treatment of the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the main physical laws proposed in landscape evolution models (LEMs). It discusses first the main partial differential equations involved in these models and their variants. These equations govern water runoff, stream incision, regolith–bedrock interaction, hillslope evolution, and sedimentation. A synthesis of existing LEMs is proposed. It proposes three models with growing complexity and with a growing number of components: two-equation models with only two components, governing water and bedrock evolution; three-equation models with three components where water, bedrock, and sediment interact; and finally models with four equations and four interacting components, namely water, bedrock, suspended sediment, and regolith. This analysis is not a mere compilation of existing LEMs. It attempts at giving the simplest and most general physically consistent set of equations, coping with all requirements stated in LEMs and LEM software. Three issues are in particular addressed and hopefully resolved. The first one is a correct formulation of the water transport equation down slopes. A general formulation for this equation is proposed, coping not only with the simplest form computing the drainage area but also with a sound energy dissipation argument associated with the Saint-Venant shallow water equations. The second issue arises from the coexistence of two competing modes, namely the detachment-limited erosion mode on hillslopes, and the transport-limited sediment transport on river beds. The third issue (linked to the second) is the fact that no conservation law is available for material in these two modes. A simple solution proposed to resolve these issues is the introduction, as suggested by several authors, of an additional variable for suspended sediment load in water. With only three variables and three equations, the above-mentioned contradictions seem to be eliminated. Several numerical experiments on real digital elevation models (DEMs) illustrate the discussion and show results of landscape evolution with the proposed synthetic models.},

While physically based models of snow redistribution have been developed for flat to gently rolling terrain, extension of these findings to steep terrain has been limited by the complexity of wind fields in such areas. In this study, we applied a nonhydrostatic and compressible atmospheric prediction model to steep alpine topography and compared the results to a fully distributed data set of snow depth estimations. The results show reduced horizontal wind velocity as well as an increasing downward vertical wind velocity over areas with the largest winter accumulation, which are mostly glacierized. We show that the wind velocity normal to the local surface, which should be zero in a nondivergent flow field and is a direct measure of increased or decreased local deposition, is a function of small-scale features of local topography. The correlation between wind fields, snow accumulation, and glacierization suggests that accurate modeling of wind fields over glacierized areas in complex terrain is a key factor for understanding the mass balance distribution of glaciers.},

These shrubs are thought to have a warming effect on permafrost by increasing snowpack thermal insulation, thereby limiting winter cooling and accelerating thaw. Here, we use ground temperature observations and heat transfer simulations to show that low shrubs can actually cool the ground in winter by providing a thermal bridge through the snowpack. Observations from unmanipulated herb tundra and shrub tundra sites on Bylot Island in the Canadian high Arctic reveal a 1.21\,°C cooling effect between November and February. This is despite a snowpack that is twice as insulating in shrubs. The thermal bridging effect is reversed in spring when shrub branches absorb solar radiation and transfer heat to the ground. The overall thermal effect is likely to depend on snow and shrub characteristics and terrain aspect. The inclusion of these thermal bridging processes into climate models may have an important impact on projected greenhouse gas emissions by permafrost.},

Ancient temperatures, measured using oxygen isotopes in the ice, can be accurately dated from annual dust layers in the ice dating back 100,000years. The δ18O data clearly show remarkable swings in climate. In the past 500years, Greenland temperatures have fluctuated back and forth between warming and cooling about 40 times, with changes every 25–30years. Among the more prominent climate changes recorded in the ice cores are 8500years of Holocene temperatures that were 2–5°F warmer than present; a 8200-year cold period in the early Holocene; the Minoan Warm Period (∼3300years ago); the Roman Warm Period (250 BC to 400 AD); the Dark Ages Cold Period (∼400–900 AD); the Medieval Warm Period (900–1300 AD); the Little Ice Age (1300 AD to the 20th century); the Wolf Minimum Cold Period (∼1280–1350 AD); the Spörer Cold Period (1460–1550 AD); the Maunder Minimum Cold Period (1645–1710); the Dalton Cold Period (1790–1820); the 1880–1915 Cold Period; the 1915–1945 Warm Period; the 1945–1977 Cold Period; and the 1978–2000 Warm Period. Comparisons of the intensity and magnitude of past warming and cooling climate changes show that the global warming experienced during the past century pales into insignificance when compared to the magnitude of profound climate reversals over the past 25,000years. At least three warming events were 20–24 times the magnitude of warming over the past century, and four were 6–9 times the magnitude of warming over the past century. The magnitude of the only modern warming that might possibly have been caused by CO2 (1978–2000) is insignificant compared to the earlier periods of warming. Arctic temperatures have fluctuated repeatedly in step with Greenland and global climate changes. Historic records at many weather stations in the Arctic show that temperatures were higher in the 1930s and 1940s than during recent warming (1980–2000). Sea ice extent has expanded and contracted with temperature fluctuations and has sharply increased over the past several years.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The warming and subsequent degradation of mountain permafrost within alpine areas represent an important process influencing the stability of steep slopes and rock faces. The unstable and monitored slopes of Mannen (Møre and Romsdal county, southern Norway) and Gámanjunni-3 (Troms and Finnmark county, northern Norway) were classified as high-risk sites by the Norwegian Geological Survey (NGU). Failure initiation has been suggested to be linked to permafrost degradation, but the detailed permafrost distribution at the sites is unknown. Rock wall (RW) temperature loggers at both sites have measured the thermal regime since 2015, showing mean rock surface temperatures between 2.5 and −1.6\,∘C depending on site and topographic aspect. Between 2016 and 2019 we conducted 2D and 3D electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) surveys on the plateau and directly within the rock wall back scarp of the unstable slopes at both sites. In combination with geophysical laboratory analysis of rock wall samples from both sites, the ERT soundings indicate widespread permafrost areas, especially at Gámanjunni-3. Finally, we conducted 2D thermal modelling to evaluate the potential thermal regime, along with an analysis of available displacement rate measurements based on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and ground- and satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) methods. Surface air and ground temperatures have increased significantly since ca. 1900 by 1 and 1.5\,∘C, and the highest temperatures have been measured and modelled since 2000 at both study sites. We observed a seasonality of displacement, with increasing velocities during late winter and early spring and the highest velocities in June, probably related to water pressure variations during snowmelt. The displacement rates of Gámanjunni-3 rockslide co-vary with subsurface resistivity and modelled ground temperature. Increased displacement rates seem to be associated with sub-zero ground temperatures and higher ground resistivity. This might be related to the presence of ground ice in fractures and pores close to the melting point, facilitating increased deformation. The study demonstrates and discusses the possible influence of permafrost, at least locally, on the dynamics of large rock slope instabilities.},

  abstract = {From 1965 to 2000 glacial geomorphology became increasingly specialized and developed significantly due to technological improvements, particularly in remote sensing, surveying and field-based glaciological process studies. The better understanding of basal thermal regimes in ice sheets and glaciers led to the development of concepts such as spatial and temporal migration of ice divides in dynamic ice sheets that could overprint subglacial landform assemblages, debris entrainment processes related to polythermal glacier systems, and glacier and ice sheet beds composed of cold and warm based mosaics. Process observations at the ice–bed interface led to the discovery of the third glacier flow mechanism, substrate deformation, which provided the impetus to reconstruct the genesis of subglacial bedforms such as drumlins and to evaluate the origins and potential flow law for till. Numerical evaluations of glacial erosion led to a better understanding of abrasion and quarrying as well as the erection of genetic models and erosion rates for larger-scale features such as U-shaped valleys and cirques. Linkages were made between debris transport pathways and moraine construction in supraglacial environments, with the role of glacier structure being linked to specific landforms, such as medial, lateral, hummocky and ice-cored moraines as well as rock glaciers. Our appreciation of the erosional and depositional impacts of glacifluvial systems was enhanced significantly with the advent of process observations on the hydrology of modern glaciers as well as the final vindication of J.H. Bretz and his proposed jökulhlaup origins of the Channelled Scablands and the Missoula Floods. In addition to the increasing numbers of studies at modern glacier snouts, the embracing of sedimentology by glacial geomorphologists was to result in significant developments in understanding the process-form regimes of subglacial, marginal and proglacial landforms, particularly the recognition of landform continua and hybrids. Advances resulting from this included the recognition of different modes of moraine and glacitectonic thrust mass development, lithofacies models of the varied glacifluvial depositional environments, and the initial expansion of work on the sediments and depocentres of glacimarine settings, the latter being the result of glacial research taking to submersibles and ice-strengthened ships for the first time. A similarly new frontier was the expansion of research on the increasingly higher resolution images returning from Mars, where extraterrestrial glaciations were recognized based on comparisons with Earth analogues. Holistic appreciations of glaciation signatures using landform assemblages were developed, initially as processform models and later as glacial landsystems, providing an ever-expanding set of templates for reconstructing palaeoglaciology in the wide variety of topographic and environmental settings, which also acknowledge spatial and temporal change in glacier and ice sheet systems.},

However, the spatio-temporal dynamics of permafrost peatland thaw remain uncertain due to complex permafrost–climate interactions, the insulating properties of peat soils and variation in model projections of future climate. Here we show that permafrost peatlands in Europe and Western Siberia will soon surpass a climatic tipping point under scenarios of moderate-to-high warming (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5). The total peatland area affected under these scenarios contains 37.0–39.5\,Gt carbon (equivalent to twice the amount of carbon stored in European forests). Our bioclimatic models indicate that all of Fennoscandia will become climatically unsuitable for peatland permafrost by 2040. Strong action to reduce emissions (SSP1-2.6) by the 2090s could retain suitable climates for permafrost peatlands storing 13.9\,Gt carbon in northernmost Western Siberia, indicating that socio-economic policies will determine the rate and extent of permafrost peatland thaw.},

Norway, with approximately half of the hydropower reservoir capacity in Europe, can contribute to balance the variability. The aim of this paper is to assess how such a role may impact the Norwegian hydropower system in terms of production pattern of the plants, changes in reservoir level and water values. The study uses a stochastic optimization and simulation model and analyses an eHighway2050 scenario combined with increases in the hydropower production capacities in Norway. The capacity increases from ca. 31 GW in the present system to 42 and 50 GW respectively. The study uses 75 years with stochastic wind, solar radiation, temperature and inflow data. The results show that the hydropower system is able to partly balance the variable production and significantly reduce the power prices for the analyzed case. The paper shows that some of the power plants utilize their increased capacity, while other plants do not due to hydrological constraints and model limitations. The paper discusses how the modelling can be further improved in order to quantify more of the potential impacts on the future power system.},

Using a new type of terrestrial laser scanner, which is particularly suited for measurements of snow covered surfaces, snow depth was monitored in a high alpine catchment during an ablation period. From these measurements snow water equivalents and ablation rates were calculated. This allowed us for the first time to obtain a high resolution (2.5 m cell size) picture of spatial variability of the snow cover and its temporal development. A very high variability of the snow cover with snow depths between 0–9 m at the end of the accumulation season was observed. This variability decreased during the ablation phase, while the dominant snow deposition features remained intact. The average daily ablation rate was between 15 mm/d snow water equivalent at the beginning of the ablation period and 30 mm/d at the end. The spatial variation of ablation rates increased during the ablation season and could not be explained in a simple manner by geographical or meteorological parameters, which suggests significant lateral energy fluxes contributing to observed melt. It is qualitatively shown that the effect of the lateral energy transport must increase as the fraction of snow free surfaces increases during the ablation period.},

The aim is to assemble current information about creep in permafrost and rock glaciers from diverse published sources into a single paper that will be useful in studies of the flow and deformation of subsurface ice and their surface manifestations not only on Earth, but also on Mars. Emphasis is placed on quantitative information from drilling, borehole measurements, geophysical soundings, photogrammetry, laboratory experiments, etc. It is evident that quantitative holistic treatment of permafrost creep and rock glaciers requires consideration of: (a) rock weathering, snow avalanches and rockfall, with grain‐size sorting on scree slopes; (b) freezing processes and ice formation in scree at sub‐zero temperatures containing abundant fine material as well as coarse‐grained blocks; (c) coupled thermohydro‐mechanical aspects of creep and failure processes in frozen rock debris; (d) kinematics of non‐isotropic, heterogeneous and layered, ice‐rich permafrost on slopes with long transport paths for coarse surface material from the headwall to the front and, in some cases, subsequent re‐incorporation into an advancing rock glacier causing corresponding age inversion at depth; and (e) the dynamics of rock glaciers, which include spatial and temporal variations in velocity that are manifested in the ridges, furrows and other surface structures typical of rock glaciers, as well as their down‐valley motion.

  abstract = {[1]~In mountainous landscapes the role of periglacial processes in producing sediment is poorly defined, despite evidence of abundant talus slopes. Ice growth in rock has long been recognized as an efficient erosion mechanism, but the effects have not been readily applied to landscape evolution in response to tectonic and climatic forcing. Here, we quantify how and where ice-driven mechanical erosion occurs in cold, bedrock-dominated landscapes using a simple one-dimensional numerical heat flow model. In our model, ice grows by water migration to colder regions in shallow rock by the reduction in chemical potential associated with intermolecular forces between ice and mineral surfaces, a process called segregation ice growth. The depth and intensity of frost cracking is primarily dependent on mean annual temperature (MAT), with positive MAT sites characterized by intense cracking in the top meter of the rock mass and a maximum frost penetration of ∼4 m. In contrast, negative MAT areas have less intense cracking that primarily occurs at depths between 50 and 800 cm. We compare the depth and intensity of frost cracking predicted by our model with measures of the intensity of frost processes determined in three studies: The first measured the timing of rockfall in the Canadian Rockies, Niagara Escarpment, and Japanese Alps; the second analyzed scree deposits in the Southern Alps, New Zealand; and the third documented rockfall frequency in Utah. These natural examples show that rockfalls tend to nucleate at elevations that coincide with zones of intense frost cracking predicted by our model. As such, climatic variations associated with interglacial-glacial cycles may impart a significant influence on the denudation of mountainous landscapes.},

  abstract = {Glaciated passive margins display dramatic fjord coasts, but also commonly retain plateau fragments inland. It has been proposed recently that such elevated, low-relief surfaces on the Norwegian margin are products of highly efficient and extensive glacial and periglacial erosion (the glacial buzzsaw) operating at equilibrium line altitudes (ELAs). We demonstrate here that glacial erosion has acted instead to dissect plateaus in western Norway. Low-relief surfaces are not generally spatially associated with cirques, and do not correlate regionally with modern and Last Glacial Maximum ELAs. Glacier dynamics require instead that glacial erosion is selective, with low-relief surfaces representing islands of limited Pleistocene erosion. Deep glacial erosion of the coast and inner shelf has provided huge volumes of sediment (70,000 km3), largely resolving apparent mismatches (65–100,000 km3) between fjord and valley volumes and Pliocene–Pleistocene sediment wedges offshore. Nonetheless, as Pleistocene glacial valleys and cirques are cut into preexisting mountain relief, tectonics rather than isostatic compensation for glacial erosion have been the main driver for late Cenozoic uplift on the Norwegian passive margin.},

Therefore, understanding how the production of sediments by glacial erosion has evolved in the past, and will evolve in a changing climate, is increasingly important. In this Review, we examine the processes that control the magnitude and timing of glacial erosion of mountains, and how models can be used to reconstruct processes during the development of mountains. Field observations reveal the important role of sliding on the erosion rate, which provide an empirical basis to explain the glacial buzzsaw and the impact of late Cenozoic cooling on erosion rates. Glacial erosion is also expected to evolve in the context of anthropogenic climate warming, as both glacier sliding and the input of meltwater related to thinning and retreat of ice will change, with large effects on downstream ecosystems and global biogeochemical cycles. Thus, the mechanics and impacts of glaciers on sediment production warrant more research, especially in regions experiencing rapid warming. Above all, there is a need for better monitoring of how erosion rates changed over the last decades and will evolve in the future.},

  abstract = {This study aims at quantifying the thermal response of mountain permafrost in southern Norway to changes in climate since 1860 and until 2100. A transient one-dimensional heat flow model was used to simulate ground temperatures and associated active layer thicknesses for nine borehole locations, which are located at different elevations and in substrates with different thermal properties. The model was forced by reconstructed air temperatures starting from 1860, which approximately coincides with the end of the Little Ice Age in the region. The impact of climate warming on mountain permafrost to 2100 is assessed by using downscaled air temperatures from a multi-model ensemble for the A1B scenario. Borehole records over three consecutive years of ground temperatures, air temperatures and snow cover data served for model calibration and validation. With an increase of air temperature of ∼1.5 ◦C over 1860–2010 and an additional warming of ∼2.8 ◦C until 2100, we simulate the evolution of ground temperatures for each borehole location. In 1860 the lower limit of permafrost was estimated to be ca. 200 m lower than observed today. According to the model, since the approximate end of the Little Ice Age, the active-layer thickness has increased by 0.5–5 m and {$>$}10 m for the sites Juvvasshøe and Tron, respectively. The most pronounced increases in active layer thickness were modelled for the last two decades since 1990 with increase rates of +2 cm yr−1 to +87 cm yr−1 (20–430 \%). According to the A1B climate scenario, degradation of mountain permafrost is suggested to occur throughout the 21st century at most of the sites below ca. 1800 m a.s.l. At the highest locations at 1900 m a.s.l., permafrost degradation is likely to occur with a probability of 55–75 \% by 2100. This implies that mountain permafrost in southern Norway is likely to be confined to the highest peaks in the western part of the country.},

Mapping of the lakes' distribution provided novel and valuable information regarding ice age palaeogeography and glacial isostatic adjustment, but the findings failed to convince the scientific community at the time. Divergent opinions concerning the inland lakes have lingered to the present, in particular as the purported glacial lake shorelines have been interpreted as subglacial or lateral meltwater features. In this study we revisit the largest palaeolake-glacial lake Nedre Glomsjø-and attempt to unravel the controversy using high-resolution airborne LiDAR data. Our mapping has revealed key and hitherto undescribed landforms indicative of an open lake system. De Geer moraines signal that the ice sheet retreated in a water-body corresponding to the elevation of the Nedre Glomsjø shorelines. The De Geer moraines also determine that the ice sheet in the region did not merely melt vertically down, but rather retreated actively southward, and we thus refute studies claiming that the purported shorelines formed along a closed ice-filled basin with stagnant ice. Based on the number of De Geer moraines, the ice-sheet margin is estimated to have retreated step-wise through our study area at a rate of 200-600 m yr-1. The study highlights the potential of mapping glacial lake remnants for assessing palaeoglaciology in an ambiguous sector of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet.},

The time‐slice maps of ice‐sheet extent are based on a new Geographical Information System (GIS) database, where we have collected published numerical dates constraining the timing of ice‐sheet advance and retreat, and additionally geomorphological and geological evidence contained within the existing literature. We integrate all uncertainty estimates into three ice‐margin lines for each time‐slice; a most‐credible line, derived from our assessment of all available evidence, with bounding maximum and minimum limits allowed by existing data. This approach was motivated by the demands of glaciological, isostatic and climate modelling and to clearly display limitations in knowledge. The timing of advance and retreat were both remarkably spatially variable across the ice‐sheet area. According to our compilation the westernmost limit along the British–Irish and Norwegian continental shelf was reached up to 7000 years earlier (at c. 27–26 ka) than the eastern limit on the Russian Plain (at c. 20–19 ka). The Eurasian ice sheet complex as a whole attained its maximum extent (5.5 Mkm2) and volume (\textasciitilde 24 m Sea Level Equivalent) at c. 21 ka. Our continental‐scale approach highlights instances of conflicting evidence and gaps in the ice‐sheet chronology where uncertainties remain large and should be a focus for future research. Largest uncertainties coincide with locations presently below sea level and where contradicting evidence exists.

Much of the present‐day land surface was buried below a thick cover of relatively young sediments in the early Miocene, 23\,Ma, when Scandinavia started to be uplifted. Big river systems eroded deeply into the rising landscape and transported sand and gravel from Norway and Sweden to Denmark where the detritus was deposited in a large delta. In Norway, the erosion formed an extensive plain near sea level that included the present‐day mountain plateau of Hardangervidda and extended across a thick pile of sediments that covered the present‐day coastal areas of Norway. Hardangervidda was uplifted to its present elevation of about 1200\,m after a second phase of uplift that began about 5\,Ma, in the early Pliocene. The hard bedrock of Hardangervidda has preserved this part of the plain as an elevated plateau, but the part of the plain that extended across the sediments has been eroded away, exposing the underlying basement rocks. That re‐exposed basement surface was shaped in the Jurassic when the climate was warm and humid. The basement rocks were weathered where rainwater seeped into fracture zones. Erosion of the weathered rocks has left a terrain of fracture valleys and hilly relief that contrasts with the sub‐horizontal plain of Hardangervidda. This weathered landscape is today exposed on the slope between the west coast and Hardangervidda. While the elevation of the mountains is young, today's landscape has a long history.},

Two years of temperature measurements in seven 1-m-deep profiles located in central-eastern Norway showed that mean annual ground temperatures were 1.3–2.0°C lower in block fields (felsenmeer) compared with till and bedrock. These data suggest that mountain permafrost can be present in block fields several hundred metres lower than in bedrock and till, providing other conditions remain the same. Better thermal coupling of the ground and the air in winter was responsible for the observed anomaly, probably caused by enhanced conduction through blocks protruding into and through the snow and thereby acting as efficient heat bridges. Convection in the blocky debris, which has been used previously as an explanation of the negative thermal anomaly, was less important than initially presumed.

The results were aggregated to generate a multi-method ensemble of plausible GMST and latitudinal-zone temperature reconstructions with a realistic range of uncertainties.

  abstract = {The dynamics and paleo‐glaciology of ice sheet interiors during the last deglaciation are poorly constrained, hindering ice sheet model reconstructions. We provide direct evidence of Fennoscandian Ice Sheet (FIS) interior behavior during deglaciation through surface exposure dating. Our results demonstrate early thinning of the FIS, prior to the Younger Dryas (YD, 12.8–11.7 ka). Interior thinning in central Norway was concurrent with retreat along the coastline, exposing ice‐free mountainous tracts, potentially as early as 20–15 ka. The FIS then formed moraines in these ice‐free tracts during the YD. This is contrary to current hypotheses advocating a landscape fully covered by cold, inactive ice during this period. Present empirical and model reconstructions fail to capture rapid interior downwastage, increasing uncertainties in ice sheet volume estimates and sea level contributions. Plain Language Summary The decay of past ice sheets provides an analogue for the retreat of present‐day ice sheets, due to rapidly changing climate conditions experienced then and now. One limitation with ice reconstructions is, however, that they rarely contain dated evidence for how the ice sheet interiors behaved during their termination. In a new reconstruction of the geometry of the southern part of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet (FIS), we overcome this limitation. We document that areas at the heart of the southern ice dome, previously thought to be consumed by thick ice, were in fact ice‐free 12,000 years ago suggesting that the FIS was considerably thinner than thought and that previous estimates of the ice sheet's volume need to be recalculated.},

We find similarities in the characteristics and spatial locations of landforms traditionally treated separately (i.e. meltwater channels, meltwater tracks and eskers) and propose that creating an integrated map of meltwater routes captures a more holistic picture of the large-scale drainage in this area. We propose the grouping of meltwater channels and meltwater tracks under the term meltwater corridor and suggest that these features in the order of 10s–100s\&thinsp;m wide, commonly surrounding eskers and transitioning along flow between different types, represent the interaction between a central conduit (the esker) and surrounding hydraulically connected distributed drainage system (the meltwater corridor). Our proposed model is based on contemporary observations and modelling which suggest that connections between conduits and the surrounding distributed drainage system within the ablation zone occur as a result of overpressurisation of the conduit. The widespread aerial coverage of meltwater corridors (5\&thinsp;\%–36\&thinsp;\% of the bed) provides constraints on the extent of basal uncoupling induced by basal water pressure fluctuations. Geomorphic work resulting from repeated connection to the surrounding hydraulically connected distributed drainage system suggests that basal sediment can be widely accessed and evacuated by meltwater.},

  abstract = {The incompleteness of the stratigraphical record is well documented, and the concept of “missing time” has attracted renewed attention in recent years. However, the importance of “missing section”, comprising rock sequences that were deposited and removed within time intervals for which no rock is now preserved, is not so widely appreciated. We focus here on studies showing that in diverse regions, many of which are regarded as free of tectonic influences over intervals of 10s to 100 s of millions of years, kilometre-scale thicknesses of rock have been deposited and subsequently removed, typically within a few tens of Myr, leaving little or no trace of their former presence in the preserved rock record. Much of the evidence for these episodes comes from low temperature thermochronology (LTT) studies of basement regions including passive continental margins, ancient orogens and cratons. Such studies have commonly been carried out within a framework of continuous slow cooling, on the assumption that denudation of these supposedly tectonically stable regions is mainly a response to changes in climate and isostatic response to erosion. In many regions, integration of LTT results with geological evidence, principally the presence of remnants of sedimentary cover and erosion surfaces, shows that histories involving long-term slow cooling/denudation are not appropriate. Instead, histories involving repeated episodes of burial and exhumation/ heating and cooling, appear to be common in these supposedly tectonically inactive regions. During these episodes, thicknesses of several kilometres may be deposited and subsequently removed, returning the underlying rock to the surface or close to it. These events affect areas of many 1000s of km2, and may affect neighbouring regions on a continental scale more or less synchronously. They may affect both basement regions and adjacent sedimentary basins. The resulting unconformities, including erosion surfaces in basement, are often very low angle in nature, reflecting the spatial scale of the affected regions, and are often mistakenly regarded as representing periods of stability. Apparent long-term preservation of elevated topography and preservation of exposed ancient landscapes have been regarded by many as enigmatic. However, both can be understood in terms of vertical motions similar to those revealed from LTT. A number of studies point to the conclusions that regions of supposedly long-lived elevated topography have been uplifted relatively recently and ancient surfaces have been preserved by burial and uncovered as a result of relatively recent exhumation. The concept of km-scale “missing section” has been regarded with scepticism by many geologists, on the basis that there is no evidence that a significant cover was ever present. But the evidence exists in the form of data from a variety of paleo-thermal and paleo-burial techniques. Some of the earliest geologists recognised the importance of former geological sequences that are no longer present. We suggest that serious consideration should be given to explaining this behaviour, rather than dismissing it as unrealistic. Intra-plate stresses from far-field plate boundary interactions and/or processes related to mantle circulation may explain the processes involved in producing episodic kilometre-scale burial and exhumation. We present a new 3D shear-wave velocity model and Moho map of Scandinavia, which is based on the inversion of the merged phase dispersion curves from ambient noise and earthquake-generated Rayleigh waves. A classic two step inversion scheme is used where first maps of phase velocities at different periods are derived, and then a 1D transdimensional Bayesian method is applied to determine the VSV-depth structure. We assess the question of what compensates for the unusual high Scandes mountains and aim to identify the different tectonic domains of the adjacent continental lithosphere (Baltic Shield). While the southern Scandes lacks a pronounced crustal root, we observe a crustal root below the northern Scandes that is decreasing towards the central Scandes. A ∼10 km thick high-density lower crustal layer is present below the northern Scandes and generally thickening to the east below the Baltic Shield. The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) below the Scandes is deepening as well from west to east with a sharp step and a strong VSV decrease with depth of 9\% in the north and of 5.5\% in the south. The LAB of the thinner lithosphere is at 150 km depth in the north and varies from 90 to 120 km depth in the south. Both LAB steps coincide with the mountain front. The central area shows rather smoothly varying structures (170 km LAB depth, −4\% VSV with depth) towards the east and no clear spatial match with the front. We infer therefore distinct uplift mechanisms along the Scandes. The southern Scandes might sustain their topography due to dynamic support from the mantle, while the northern Scandes experience both crustal and mantle lithosphere isostasy. In both cases, we suspect a dynamic support from small-scale edge-driven convection that developed at the sharp lithospheric steps. Beneath the Archean Karelia craton in northern Finland, we find low-velocity areas below 150 km depth while a 250 km deep lithospheric keel is imaged below the Paleoproterozic southern Finland. The Norrbotten craton in northern Sweden can be identified at mantle depths as a unit different from the Karelia craton, Scandes and Paleoproterozic central Sweden. Based on new geochronological (amino acids and Sr-isotopes) and lithological data combined with analyses of 3D seismic data, the Pliocene-Pleistocene development of the central northern North Sea has been investigated. At the start of the Plio-Pleistocene Transition the study area was dominated by a deltaic, shallow marine or tidal depositional environment with sediments mainly sourced from the west. These sand-rich sediments include green glauconitic grains that belong to the Utsira Sand with a local provenance. Directly above the base Quaternary (R2) a 60 m thick layer of mud-rich sediments of glacimarine origin were deposited at a rate of ∼12 cm/ka between ∼2–1.5 Ma and up to 80 cm/ka between 1.5 and 1.2 Ma possibly reflecting glacial ice advancing to the Norwegian coastline. The high rate of deposition in the Early Pleistocene occurred immediately before the initiation of the Norwegian Channel Ice Stream at ∼1.1 Ma. Following this, a large part of the sediment input from Fennoscandia seems to have been directed away from the study area to the shelf break. At the start of the Mid Pleistocene Transition (MPT), subaerial conditions allowed the formation of a {$>$}50 km long fluvial channel across the study area draining water from the east to the south west. The earliest evidence of grounded ice in the investigated area comes from mega scale glacial lineations formed during the MPT, at or just after ∼1.2 Ma. Following this, a regional unconformity (R4) was formed by one or more grounded ice advances across the study area possibly during or directly after the MPT and likely marks the boundary between the Early and Mid Pleistocene glacimarine sediments. The Mid to Late Pleistocene stratigraphy is dominated by glacimarine sediments and tills and is associated with multiple generations of tunnel valleys observed within the seismic data. A high shear strength till containing chalk clasts transported from the west and/or south of the study area was likely deposited during MIS6 and may have been more conducive to tunnel valley formation in comparison to lower shear strength tills deposited by later ice advances. A thick till unit overlain by a sand layer in the study area was deposited by grounded ice during the Last Glacial Maximum and subsequent drainage of an ice dammed lake in the southern North Sea during the last deglaciation (MIS2) of the study area. This study shows that much of the Quaternary age sediments within the northern North Sea were deposited relatively rapidly during short periods of time probably leaving significant hiatuses within the stratigraphic record. This finding has implications for previous studies that use a chronological framework assuming a relatively continuous sedimentation rate and record for the Early Pleistocene within the North Sea. Elevated plateaux and deeply incised valleys characterise the large-scale landscapes along the East Greenland margin as in many elevated, passive continental margins around the world. The absence of syn- or post-rift rocks in, for example, the mountains of Norway, hampers the assessment of the age of these landscapes and of the present-day elevation. The mountains of southern East Greenland (68–71°N), however, expose thick basalts that were extruded onto a largely horizontal lava plain near sea level during breakup of the NE Atlantic at the Paleocene–Eocene transition. We take advantage of these favourable geological conditions to investigate the uplift history after continental breakup. In particular, it is clear that present-day elevations of these basalts up to 3.7 km above sea level (a.s.l.) were reached after breakup. We have mapped regional erosion surfaces and integrated the information about the landscape with the stratigraphic record (i.e. stratigraphic landscape analysis). The analysis led to the following relative denudation chronology for southern East Greenland: At breakup, the margin subsided and underwent km-scale burial. Around the Eocene–Oligocene transition, the first phase of uplift, tilting and subsequent erosion led to the formation of an extensive, low-relief erosion surface (the Upper Planation Surface, UPS) that was graded towards the base level of the adjacent ocean before the eruption of Miocene lavas onto that surface. A second uplift that most likely occurred after the Miocene produced a new erosion surface (the Lower Planation Surface, LPS) by incision below the UPS. Finally, a third event in the late Cenozoic lifted the UPS and the LPS to their present elevations of up to 3 and 2 km a.s.l., respectively and shaped the present-day valleys and fjords by incision of rivers and glaciers below the LPS. The general picture of landscape development is highly similar to West Greenland and the common characteristics between the stepped landscapes in East Greenland and those on the conjugate margin in Scandinavia lead us to conclude that the mountains of Norway also formed after the North Atlantic breakup. We analyse travel times of shear waves, which were recorded at the MAGNUS network, to determine the 3D shear wave velocity (vS) structure underneath Southern Scandinavia. The travel time residuals are corrected for the known crustal structure of Southern Norway and weighted to account for data quality and pick uncertainties. The resulting residual pattern of subvertically incident waves is very uniform and simple. It shows delayed arrivals underneath Southern Norway compared to fast arrivals underneath the Oslo Graben and the Baltic Shield. The 3D upper mantle vS structure underneath the station network is determined by performing non-linear travel time tomography. As expected from the residual pattern the resulting tomographic model shows a simple and continuous vS perturbation pattern: a negative vS anomaly is visible underneath Southern Norway relative to the Baltic Shield in the east with a contrast of up to 4\% vS and a sharp W–E dipping transition zone. Reconstruction tests reveal besides vertical smearing a good lateral reconstruction of the dipping vS transition zone and suggest that a deep-seated anomaly at 330–410 km depth is real and not an inversion artefact. The upper part of the reduced vS anomaly underneath Southern Norway (down to 250 km depth) might be due to an increase in lithospheric thickness from the Caledonian Southern Scandes in the west towards the Proterozoic Baltic Shield in Sweden in the east. The deeper-seated negative vS anomaly (330–410 km depth) could be caused by a temperature anomaly possibly combined with effects due to fluids or hydrous minerals. The determined simple 3D vS structure underneath Southern Scandinavia indicates that mantle processes might influence and contribute to a Neogene uplift of Southern Norway. The major zone of continental–continental collision on Earth today is along the Alpine–Himalayan Chain, which is home to the Pyrenees, European Alps, Turkish-Iranian Plateau, the Himalaya, and the Tibetan Plateau. Continental–continental collision also occurs in the Southern Alps of New Zealand and has produced a number of ancient orogens, including the Appalachians, Urals, and Caledonides. The extensive, long-lived deformation, and particularly the crustal thickening, and therefore weakening, associated with continental collisions results in unique tectonic geomorphology. An important topic in understanding the tectonic geomorphology of continental–continental collision zones is whether or not flux, topographic, thermal, or exhumational steady state can be achieved and how each can be recognized. Another subject of study is the relative controls of tectonics and climate on range width and asymmetry. Tectonic geomorphology has also been used to identify the lateral transport of crust, either brittlely, along strike–slip faults, or ductilely, through lower crustal flow. Drainage reorganization is a particularly powerful tool for inferring uplift patterns. Geomorphologic studies also yield insights into lithospheric foundering. Finally, tectonic geomorphology can help explain the persistence of topography over long-innactive orogens. In this contribution these topics are explored on an orogen-by-orogen basis.},

  abstract = {Three equations derived from a close exponential glacier-climate relationship at the equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) of Norwegian glaciers have been utilized and implemented in a geographical information system (GIS). The first equation enables calculation of the minimum altitude of areas climatically suited for glacier formation at present, and is termed the altitude of instantaneous glacierization (AIG). Equation (2) is based on the ‘principle of terrain adaptation’, enabling quantification of the glacial buildup sensitivity (GBS) in an area. The third equation calculates the theoretical climatic (instrumental) temperature-precipitation ELA (CTP-ELA) in presently non-glaciated areas by combining GBS with terrain altitude. The presented approach is primarily intended for palaeoclimatic analyses of former glacial records, and is tested here based on a plot of 122 temperature stations and 197 precipitation stations during the climate normal period 1961-1990 which has been recalculated to sea level using empirical vertical climatic gradients. These data were interpolated in the GIS using an ‘inverse square interpolation’ routine. Subsequently, the interpolated climatic data were recalculated to the terrain surface using vertical climatic gradients and a digital elevation model (DEM) of southern Norway (resolution 5 X 5 degree minutes/c. 1 km2). The present glacier distribution in southern Norway is reproduced in great detail, and maps showing the modem GBS and CTP-ELA in non-glacierized areas of southern Norway are presented. Based on the GBS analysis, four scenarios with ELA depressions of 150 m (average ‘Little Ice Age’ conditions), 500 m (average coastal Younger Dryas conditions), 1000 m (suggested late Weichselian maximum coastal conditions) and 1500 m are shown.},

However, the evolution of permafrost over longer time periods, such as the Holocene, is unknown, but is considered to have significance for landscape development and geomorphological processes in high mountain areas of Scandinavia. In this study two mean annual air temperature series covering the Holocene have been compiled to drive a 1D heat flow model over a 10kyr period for several sites in Norway. At each site temperature-monitored boreholes exist, which were used to calibrate the model. In addition the spatial distribution of permafrost during selected time periods of the Holocene was addressed using a newly implemented version of an equilibrium permafrost model. The result of this study indicates an altitudinal zonation of relative permafrost age in Norway. We find that permafrost has existed continuously since the deglaciation at the highest altitudes, whereas in large areas where permafrost currently is present, it degraded during the Holocene thermal maximum (HTM). In all boreholes the coldest simulated permafrost occurred during the ‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA), and also the largest areal distribution of Holocene permafrost in Norway seems to be connected to the LIA.},

  abstract = {Landforms in Norway indicating present and former permafrost have been compiled in order to discuss Holocene landform development patterns. In total 307 permafrost landforms have been mapped, consisting of rock glaciers and ice-cored moraines. The landforms were classified as active/inactive (intact) or relict landforms, and by origin. In northern Norway, permafrost landforms exist down to sea level and the majority of the landforms are relict talus-derived rock glaciers. In southern Norway, permafrost landforms are restricted to high elevations and the majority of the landforms are connected to glacial activity and classified as active. In the present paper, this contrasting pattern is interpreted to reflect that different processes leading to a permafrost landform also represent different ages and climatic regimes during their formation. The inventoried landforms reproduce the modelled permafrost distribution for Norway satisfactorily.},

  date = {2019},
  abstract = {Abstract The investigation of periglacial and related landforms in South Norway is of high interest for exploring timings of deglaciation and to assess their geomorphological connectivity to palaeoclimatic changes during the Late Quaternary and the Holocene. The ice margins of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) are fairly well known, the palaeo-ice thickness, however, which can only be estimated by modelling, remains unclear over large parts of Norway owing to rare field based evidences. Due to the significant influence of the former horizontal and vertical ice-sheet extent on sea-level rise, atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns, erosive properties of glaciers and ice sheets, englacial thermal boundaries and deglaciation dynamics, it is crucial to better understand the topographic features of the LGM ice sheet. Despite recent advances, there is a lack of terrestrial evidences from numerical data in South Norway. In this thesis two high-mountain regions and their surroundings in west (Dalsnibba, 1476 m a.s.l.) and east (Blåhø, 1617 m a.s.l.) South Norway were used to reconstruct palaeoclimatic conditions and deglaciation patterns. Terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides (10Be) and Schmidt-hammer exposure-age dating (SHD) have been utilized to determine the surface exposure of glacially transported boulders as well as of boulderdominated glacial, periglacial and paraglacial landforms and bedrock outcrops. By developing calibration curves at both study sites for the first time, through young and old control points of known age, it was possible to obtain landform age estimates from Schmidt hammer R-(rebound) values. Beside age estimates, the formation and stabilization of those landforms and the involved processes have provided indications about the Late Quaternary and Holocene climate variability and its connectivity to landform development.},

A SHD calibration curve was constructed for the local banded gneiss using two control points: (1) fresh bedrock in a road cutting; and (2) glacially scoured bedrock surfaces deglaciated c. 9.7 ka. Two alternative hypotheses are suggested to explain SHD ages (± 95\% confidence intervals) of 10 340 ± 1280, 9920 ± 1385 and 8965 ± 1700 years obtained for the three rock glaciers located 1000 m below the present lower limit of mountain permafrost, at a site covered by glacier ice throughout the Late Weichselian. First, the rock glaciers may be paraglacial features, which formed rapidly during deglaciation when enhanced debris supply may have buried residual ice bodies. If this was the case, the SHD ages are a true reflection of rock glacier age. Second, the rock glaciers may have formed during several thousand years of permafrost conditions in the Mid-Weichselian (possibly during the Ålesund Interstadial, c. 34.5–38.2 ka) and then been preserved beneath a cold-based ice sheet until renewed exposure during Holocene deglaciation. If the second hypothesis is true, then the true age of the rock glaciers is much older than their SHD ages, the latter failing to record the interval of burial when rock weathering would have been zero. Although evidence is currently insufficient to distinguish between these two interpretations, the paper demonstrates both the potential and limitations of high-precision SHD in the context of rock glaciers.

Glacial erosion linked to long-term spatial gradients in the ELA created a tilted, planar zone of 373 cirques across the central part of the range; peaks and ridges now rise ≤600 m above this zone. Hypsometric analysis of the region shows that the proportion of land area above the cirques drops sharply, and mean slopes {$>$}30               °               indicate that the areas above the cirques may be at or near threshold steepness. The mean plus 1σ relief of individual cirque basins (570 m) corresponds to the ∼600-m envelope above which peaks rarely rise. The summit altitudes are set by a combination of higher rates of glacial and paraglacial erosion above the ELA and enhanced hillslope processes due to the creation of steep topography. On the high-precipitation western flank of the Cascades, the dominance of glacial and hillslope erosion at altitudes at and above the ELA may explain the lack of a correspondence between stream-power erosion models and measured exhumation rates from apatite (U-Th/He) thermochronometry.},

  abstract = {The temporal evolution of seasonal snow cover and its spatial variability in environments such as mountains, prairies or polar regions is strongly influenced by the interactions between the atmospheric boundary layer and the snow cover. Wind-driven coupling processes affect both mass and energy fluxes at the snow surface with consequences on snow hydrology, avalanche hazard, and ecosystem development. This paper proposes a review on these processes and combines the more recent findings obtained from observations and modeling. The spatial variability of snow accumulation across multiple scales can be associated to wind-driven processes ranging from orographic precipitation at large scale to preferential-deposition of snowfall and wind-induced transport of snow on the ground at smaller scales. An overview of models of varying complexity developed to simulate these processes is proposed in this paper. Snow ablation is also affected by wind-driven processes. Over continuous snow covers, turbulent fluxes of latent and sensible heat, as well as blowing snow sublimation, modify the mass, and energy balance of the snowpack and their representation in numerical models is associated with many uncertainties. As soon as the snow cover becomes patchy in spring local heat advection induces the development of stable internal boundary layers changing heat exchange toward the snow. Overall, wind-driven processes play a key role in all the different stages of the evolution of seasonal snow. Improvements in process understanding particularly at the mountain-ridge and the slope scale, and processes representations in models at scales up to the mountain range scale, will be the basis for improved short-term forecast and climate projections in snow-covered regions.},

To answer this, with an emphasis on lowland periglacial areas, the present study distinguishes between characteristic and polygenetic periglacial landscapes, and considers how complete is the footprint of periglaciation? Using a conceptual framework of landscape sensitivity and change, the study applies four geological criteria (periglacial persistence, extraglacial regions, ice-rich substrates, and aggradation of sediment and permafrost) through the last 3.5 million years of the late Cenozoic to identify permafrost regions in the Northern Hemisphere. In limited areas of unglaciated permafrost regions are characteristic periglacial landscapes whose morphology has been adjusted essentially to present (i.e., Holocene interglacial) process conditions, namely thermokarst landscapes, and mixed periglacial–alluvial and periglacial–deltaic landscapes. More widespread in past and present permafrost regions are polygenetic periglacial landscapes, which inherit ancient landsurfaces on which periglacial landforms are superimposed to varying degrees, presently or previously. Such landscapes comprise relict accumulation plains and aprons, frost-susceptible and nonfrost-susceptible terrains, cryopediments, and glacial–periglacial landscapes. Periglaciation can produce topographic fingerprints at mesospatial scales (103–105 m): (1) relict accumulation plains and aprons form where long-term sedimentation buried landsurfaces; and (2) plateaux with convexo–concave hillslopes and inset with valleys, formed by bedrock brecciation, mass wasting, and stream incision in frost-susceptible terrain.},

  abstract = {Tectonics and erosion are the driving forces in the evolution of mountain belts, but the identification of their relative contributions remains a fundamental scientific problem in relation to the understanding of both geodynamic processes and surface processes. The issue is further complicated through the roles of climate and climatic change. For more than a century it has been thought that the present high topography of western Scandinavia was created by some form of active tectonic uplift during the Cenozoic. This has been based mainly on the occurrence of surface remnants and accordant summits at high elevation believed to have been graded to sea level, the inference of increasing erosion rates toward the present-day based on the age of offshore erosion products and the erosion histories inferred from apatite fission track data, and on over-burial and seaward tilting of coast-proximal sediments. In contrast to this received wisdom, we demonstrate here that the evidence can be substantially explained by a model of protracted exhumation of topography since the Caledonide Orogeny. Exhumation occurred by gravitational collapse, continental rifting and erosion. Initially, tectonic exhumation dominated, although erosion rates were high. The subsequent demise of onshore tectonic activity allowed slow erosion to become the dominating exhumation agent. The elevation limiting and landscape shaping activities of wet-based alpine glaciers, cirques and periglacial processes gained importance with the greenhouse–icehouse climatic deterioration at the Eocene–Oligocene boundary and erosion rates increased. The flattish surfaces that these processes can produce suggest an alternative to the traditional tectonic interpretation of these landscape elements in western Scandinavia. The longevity of western Scandinavian topography is due to the failure of rifting processes in destroying the topography entirely, and to the buoyant upward feeding of replacement crustal material commensurate with exhumation unloading. We emphasize the importance of differentiating the morphological, sedimentological and structural signatures of recent active tectonics from the effects of long-term exhumation and isostatic rebound in understanding the evolution of similar elevated regions.},

Our hypothesis, in contrast, honours well-documented physical laws and the present wealth of actual data constraints (as opposed to dogma-biased inferences). After careful consideration of the points raised by Chalmers et al. (2010) we maintain our simple explanation for the evolution of Scandinavian topography, as it honours well-documented actual data constraints, such as crustal structure (including its spatio-temporal variability), thermal history in the eastern North Sea, global and regional climatic change (including eustacy) and sedimentation in the adjacent basins. The inevitable conclusion is that, although more data constraints are desirable, the current best fit hypothesis, is that the Scandinavian topography is of Caledonide origin, and has been shaped by fluvial and glacial buzzsaw and periglacial processes, and most recently (last few Myr) been re-invigorated by extensive glacial erosion in the fjords and on the shelf.},

To address this shortcoming, correlations between the ELAs of 513 modern cirque glaciers and present-day climatic and topographic variables across Scandinavia, as well as regional trends in ELA and climate, are analysed. ELAs are calculated using the Area-Altitude-Balance-Ratio method, with a ratio of 1.5\,±\,0.4. Results indicate that glacier ELAs are strongly correlated with distance from the coast. This reflects the present-day precipitation pattern of the region (characterised by high precipitation near the sea) and demonstrates a climate dominated by a maritime-continental transition. Temperature explains differences in glacier ELA regional trends as well as ELA changes with latitude. Following standard meteorological convention, Scandinavia is divided into two macro-climate regions and analyses are run within the macro-regions as well as the complete dataset. The strength of correlations between ELA and precipitation increases when the study is divided into northern and southern macro-regions. These results test long held assumptions about relationships between climate and cirque glacier ELA, which is of particular relevance to palaeoclimatic studies based on the reconstruction of former cirque glaciers.},

  abstract = {Cirques are glacially eroded, bowl-shaped depressions, characterised by steep headwalls and flat or overdeepened floors. Given their association with past glaciers, cirques are sometimes used as proxies for palaeoclimate. However, cirques are shaped over multiple glacial cycles, and their usefulness as palaeoclimate indicators therefore remains open to question. In this paper, we map 3984 glacier-free cirques across the Scandinavian Peninsula and analyse variations in cirque floor altitude (CFA). We explore the relationships between CFAs and cirque aspect, latitude, longitude, and distance to the coast. We test the validity of using CFAs as indicators of palaeoclimate through comparison with the equilibrium-line altitudes (ELAs) of 513 modern cirque glaciers. Results indicate that both CFAs and modern cirque-glacier ELAs decrease with latitude and vary with aspect, being generally lowest on east-facing slopes. However, the clearest and strongest trend in both CFAs and modern cirque glacier ELAs is an increase in elevation with distance from the modern coast (i.e., distance ‘inland’). This likely indicates that similar climatic gradients, particularly an inland reduction in precipitation, acted to regulate former sites of glacier initiation (reflected by CFAs) and modern glacier ELAs. This would imply that CFAs are a useful proxy for palaeoclimate. However, we note that both CFAs and modern ELAs reflect the general topography of this region (with increasing elevations moving inland), and the glacial history of the area (indirectly linked to palaeoclimate) may have played a role in regulating where cirques have formed. For these reasons, we suggest that palaeoclimatic interpretations derived from CFAs should be treated with caution.},

These neotectonic features are likely to be mostly related to gravitational effects of excess mass along the Mohns Ridge, within the Iceland Plateau and the southern Scandinavian mountains, to Pliocene/Pleistocene sedimentary loading/unloading, and to postglacial rebound. A major seismic pulse most likely accompanied each of the deglaciations following the multiple glaciation cycles in mainland Fennoscandia during the last 600,000 years. Seismic pumping associated with these glaciation cycles may have facilitated fluid and gas leakage from organic-rich sediments and reservoirs through gas chimneys, ultimately forming pockmarks on the sea floor. This mechanism could also have contributed to the concentration and pumping of hydrocarbons from their source rocks to reservoir formations. Pressure decrease associated with removal of sedimentary overburden on the Norwegian shelf has caused expansion of gas and resulted in expulsion of oil from the traps. Where uplift and tilting resulted in local extension, seal breaching and spillage have also occurred. Future rock avalanches and landslides, triggered by earthquakes, could generate tsunamis in fjords and lakes and constitute the greatest seismic hazard to society in Norway. Our understanding of neotectonic activity is consequently important for the evaluation of hazard and risk related to rockslope instability.},

They were behind their present-day limits in the Arctic archipelagos, and most likely absent from the British Isles and from many European and Mediterranean mountains, such as Scandinavia, Iceland, the Urals, the Carpathians, the Pyrenees, and the Iberian, Italian and Moroccan mountains. They had a very reduced extension in the Caucasus, the Alps and the Balkans. Consequently, Middle Holocene glacial landforms are rarely observed. The landforms in the interior of the mountain cirques were erased by the glacier advances in the Late Holocene. The evolution of European glaciers is similar to the rest of the mountains of the Northern Hemisphere. The time of the glacier minimum extent is variable throughout the Middle Holocene in each region, in relation to local factors. The behaviour of glaciers in the Southern Hemisphere is also very similar to those in Europe, reaching their minimum extent in some cases in the Early Holocene and in others in the Middle Holocene, although with great variability depending on the precipitation regime in each region. In most regions of both hemispheres, glaciers began to advance from the mid to late Middle Holocene. The difference in the chronology of the Holocene Thermal Maximum depends on the harmonisation between different climatic proxies and local conditions in each region, mainly related to precipitation.},

The Holocene thermal maximum was characterized by strong summer solar heating that substantially increased the summertime temperature relative to preindustrial climate. However, the summer warming was compensated by weaker winter insolation, and the annual mean temperature of the Holocene thermal maximum remains ambiguous. Using multimodel mid-Holocene simulations, we show that the annual mean Northern Hemisphere temperature is strongly correlated with the degree of Arctic amplification and sea ice loss. Additional model experiments show that the summer Arctic sea ice loss persists into winter and increases the mid- and high-latitude temperatures. These results are evaluated against four proxy datasets to verify that the annual mean northern high-latitude temperature during the mid-Holocene was warmer than the preindustrial climate, because of the seasonally rectified temperature increase driven by the Arctic amplification. This study offers a resolution to the “Holocene temperature conundrum”, a well-known discrepancy between paleo-proxies and climate model simulations of Holocene thermal maximum.},

Despite its global significance, a comprehensive account of its evolution from independent nucleation centres to its maximum extent is conspicuously lacking. Here, a first-order, thermomechanical model, robustly constrained by empirical evidence, is used to investigate the dynamics of the EISC throughout its build-up to its maximum configuration. The ice flow model is coupled to a reference climate and applied at 10~km spatial resolution across a domain that includes the three main spreading centres of the Celtic, Fennoscandian and Barents Sea ice sheets. The model is forced with the NGRIP palaeo-isotope curve from 37 ka BP onwards and model skill is assessed against collated flowsets, marginal moraines, exposure ages and relative sea-level history. The evolution of the EISC to its LGM configuration was complex and asynchronous; the western, maritime margins of the Fennoscandian and Celtic ice sheets responded rapidly and advanced across their continental shelves by 29 ka BP, yet the maximum aerial extent (5.48~×~106~km2) and volume (7.18~×~106~km3) of the ice complex was attained some 6 ka later at c. 22.7 ka BP. This maximum stand was short-lived as the North Sea and Atlantic margins were already in retreat whilst eastern margins were still advancing up until c. 20 ka BP. High rates of basal erosion are modelled beneath ice streams and outlet glaciers draining the Celtic and Fennoscandian ice sheets with extensive preservation elsewhere due to frozen subglacial conditions, including much of the Barents and Kara seas. Here, and elsewhere across the Norwegian shelf and North Sea, high pressure subglacial conditions would have promoted localised gas hydrate formation.},

  abstract = {The Eurasian ice sheet complex (EISC) was the third largest ice mass during the Last Glacial Maximum with a span of over 4500 km and responsible for around 20 m of eustatic sea-level lowering. Whilst recent terrestrial and marine empirical insights have improved understanding of the chronology, pattern and rates of retreat of this vast ice sheet, a concerted attempt to model the deglaciation of the EISC honouring these new constraints is conspicuously lacking. Here, we apply a first-order, thermomechanical ice sheet model, validated against a diverse suite of empirical data, to investigate the retreat of the EISC after 23 ka BP, directly extending the work of Patton et al. (2016) who modelled the build-up to its maximum extent. Retreat of the ice sheet complex was highly asynchronous, reflecting contrasting regional sensitivities to climate forcing, oceanic influence, and internal dynamics. Most rapid retreat was experienced across the Barents Sea sector after 17.8 ka BP when this marine-based ice sheet disintegrated at a rate of \textasciitilde 670 gigatonnes per year (Gt aÀ1) through enhanced calving and interior dynamic thinning, driven by oceanic/atmospheric warming and exacerbated by eustatic sea-level rise. From 14.9 to 12.9 ka BP the EISC lost on average 750 Gt aÀ1, peaking at rates {$>$}3000 Gt aÀ1, roughly equally partitioned between surface melt and dynamic losses, and potentially contributing up to 2.5 m to global sea-level rise during Meltwater Pulse 1A. Independent glacio-isostatic modelling constrained by an extensive inventory of relative sea-level change corroborates our ice sheet loading history of the Barents Sea sector. Subglacial conditions were predominately temperate during deglaciation, with over 6000 subglacial lakes predicted along with an extensive subglacial drainage network. Moreover, the maximum EISC and its isostatic footprint had a profound impact on the proglacial hydrological network, forming the Fleuve Manche mega-catchment which had an area of \textasciitilde 2.5 Â 106 km2 and drained the present day Vistula, Elbe, Rhine and Thames rivers through the Seine Estuary. During the Bølling/Allerød oscillation after c. 14.6 ka BP, two major proglacial lakes formed in the Baltic and White seas, buffering meltwater pulses from eastern Fennoscandia through to the Younger Dryas when these massive proglacial freshwater lakes flooded into the North Atlantic Ocean. Deglaciation temporarily abated during the Younger Dryas stadial at 12.9 ka BP, when remnant ice across Svalbard, Franz Josef Land, Novaya Zemlya, Fennoscandia and Scotland experienced a short-lived but dynamic re-advance. The final stage of deglaciation converged on present day ice cover around the Scandes mountains and the Barents Sea by 8.7 ka BP, although the phase-lagged isostatic recovery still continues today.},

Most surface area in glaciated mountain ranges is concentrated below the modern snowline as predicted by the glacial buzzsaw hypothesis. Above the modern snowline the analysed mountain regions all exhibit an exponential decay of surface area with height. On the basis of this decay, the analysed mountain regions fall within three distinct groups primarily reflecting variations in average values of rock column uplift rates. Mountain ranges affected by rapid rock column uplift display high above-snowline relief and large decay lengths, whereas inactive orogens have little relief above the modern snowline. We find a surprisingly simple relation between hypsometry above the local snowline and regional tectonic activity.},

Priority was given to completeness of coverage, but a limited, uniform set of attributes is attached to each of the \textasciitilde 198 000 glaciers in its latest version, 3.2. Satellite imagery from 1999–2010 provided most of the outlines. Their total extent is estimated as 726 800 ± 34 000 km2. The uncertainty, about ±5\%, is derived from careful single-glacier and basin-scale uncertainty estimates and comparisons with inventories that were not sources for the RGI. The main contributors to uncertainty are probably misinterpretation of seasonal snow cover and debris cover. These errors appear not to be normally distributed, and quantifying them reliably is an unsolved problem. Combined with digital elevation models, the RGI glacier outlines yield hypsometries that can be combined with atmospheric data or model outputs for analysis of the impacts of climatic change on glaciers.

  abstract = {Because the glacier snowline is easy to identify on optical satellite images and because in certain conditions it can be used as an indicator of the equilibrium line, it may be a relevant parameter for the study of the relationships between climate and glaciers. Although several studies have shown that the snowline altitude (SLA) at the end of the hydrological year is a good indicator of the equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) for mid-latitude glaciers, such a relationship remains conjectural for tropical glaciers. Indeed, unlike in mid-latitudes, tropical climate conditions result in a distinct seasonality of accumulation/ablation processes. We examine this relationship using direct field ELA and mass-balance measurements made on Glaciar Zongo, Bolivia (\textasciitilde 16° S), vand Glaciar Artesonraju, Peru (\textasciitilde 9° S), and the SLA retrieved from satellite images acquired in the past two decades. We show that on glaciers in the outer tropics: (1) ablation is reduced during the dry season in austral winter (May-August), the SLA does not change much, and satellite images acquired between May and August could be used to compute the SLA; and (2) the highest SLA detected on a number of satellite images acquired during the dry season provides a good estimate of the annual ELA. However, as snowfall events can occur during the dry season, the SLA detected on satellite images tends to underestimate the ELA. Thus, we recommend validating the SLA computed from satellite images with field data collected on a benchmark glacier before measuring the SLA on other glaciers in the same mountain range for which no field data are available. This study is a major step towards extending the measurement of glacier parameters (ELA and mass balance) at the scale of a whole mountain range in the outer tropics to better document the relationships between climate and glaciers.},

  abstract = {The separation of fresh snow, exposed glacier ice and debris covered ice on glacier surfaces is needed for hydrologic applications and for understanding the response of glaciers to climate variability. The end-of-season snowline altitude (SLA) is an indicator of the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of a glacier and is often used to infer the mass balance of a glacier. Regional snowline estimates are generally missing from glacier inventories for remote, high-altitude glacierized areas such as High Mountain Asia. In this study, we present an automated, decision-based image classification algorithm implemented in Python to separate snow, ice and debris surfaces on glaciers and to extract glacier snowlines at monthly and annual time steps and regional scales. The method was applied in the Hunza basin in the Karakoram and the Trishuli basin in eastern Himalaya. We automatically partitioned the various types of surfaces on glaciers at each time step using image band ratios combined with topographic criteria based on two versions of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission elevation dataset. SLAs were extracted on a pixel-by-pixel basis using a “buffer” method adapted for each elevation dataset. Over the period studied (2000–2016), end-of-the-ablation season annual ELAs fluctuated from 4,917 to 5,336 m a.s.l. for the Hunza, with a 16-year average of 5,177 ± 108 m a.s.l., and 5,395–5,565 m a.s.l. for the Trishuli, with an average of 5,444 ± 63 m a.s.l. Snowlines were sensitive to the manual corrections of the partition, the topographic slope, the elevation dataset and the band ratio thresholds particularly during the spring and winter months, and were not sensitive to the size of the buffer used to extract the snowlines. With further refinement and calibration with field measurements, this method can be easily applied to higher resolution Sentinel-2 data (5 days temporal resolution) as well as daily PlanetScope to derive sub-monthly snowlines.},

  abstract = {Several numerical landscape evolution models (LEMs) have been developed to date, and many are available as open source codes. Most are written in efficient programming languages such as Fortran or C, but often require additional code efforts to plug in to more user-friendly data analysis and/or visualization tools to ease interpretation and scientific insight. In this paper, we present an effort to port a common core of accepted physical principles governing landscape evolution directly into a high-level language and data analysis environment such as Matlab. SIGNUM (acronym for Simple Integrated Geomorphological Numerical Model) is an independent and self-contained Matlab, TIN-based landscape evolution model, built to simulate topography development at various space and time scales. SIGNUM is presently capable of simulating hillslope processes such as linear and nonlinear diffusion, fluvial incision into bedrock, spatially varying surface uplift which can be used to simulate changes in base level, thrust and faulting, as well as effects of climate changes. Although based on accepted and well-known processes and algorithms in its present version, it is built with a modular structure, which allows to easily modify and upgrade the simulated physical processes to suite virtually any user needs. The code is conceived as an open-source project, and is thus an ideal tool for both research and didactic purposes, thanks to the high-level nature of the Matlab environment and its popularity among the scientific community. In this paper the simulation code is presented together with some simple examples of surface evolution, and guidelines for development of new modules and algorithms are proposed.},

  abstract = {We present geomorphological evidence of large, previously undocumented, early Holocene ice-dammed lakes in the Scandinavian Mountains of northwestern Sweden. The lakes extents indicate that the last remnants of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet were located east of the mountain range. Some early pioneering works have presented similar reconstructions, whereas more recently published reconstructions place the last ice remnants in the high mountains of Sarek. Using high-resolution airborne LiDAR data we have mapped a large number of hitherto undocumented shorelines in some of the main valleys within the northern Scandinavian mountain range. Our results indicate that a larger system of ice-dammed lakes existed in this region than previously thought. The lakes were dammed between the main water divide to the west and the retreating ice sheet margin to the east. The shorelines dip towards the northwest with gradients ranging from 0.5 to 0.4\,m/km, from the oldest to the youngest. Further, we have compiled Lateglacial and Holocene shoreline data along the Norwegian coast and from within the Baltic Sea basin and reconstructed the isostatic uplift along a 1400\,km long northwest-southeast transect from the Norwegian Sea to Lake Ladoga. By comparing the measured ice-dammed lake shoreline gradients to the dated marine shorelines, we infer that the lakes may have existed for several centuries following 10.2\,cal ka BP. We also describe large deposits and extensive erosive features, which demonstrate that a catastrophic glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) took place eastward along the Pite River Valley. Based on cross-cutting relations to raised shorelines developed in the early Holocene Ancylus Lake (Baltic Sea basin) we conclude that the flood and thus the final phase of deglaciation took place within the time interval 10.3–9.9\,cal ka BP.},

  abstract = {Understanding past responses of ice sheets to climate change provides an important long‐term context for observations of present day, and projected future, ice‐sheet change. In this work, we reconstruct the deglaciation of the marine‐terminating western margin of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet in the outer Hardangerfjorden area of southwestern Norway, following the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) until the start of the Holocene. We base our interpretations on a combination of geomorphological mapping using high‐resolution (LiDAR) terrain models, 68 new cosmogenic nuclide 10Be exposure ages and radiocarbon‐dated lake sediment cores, supported by the stratigraphic position of the 12.1\,ka Vedde Ash. We show that even the highest mountain summits in the area (\textasciitilde 1200–1400\,m a.s.l.) were ice‐covered during the LGM, thus settling debates concerning the Scandinavian Ice Sheet thickness in this region. These summits emerged as nunataqs through the ice sheet about 22–18\,ka, potentially owing to upstream ice thinning caused by the break‐up and retreat of the Norwegian Channel Ice Stream. Following the break‐up of the Norwegian Channel Ice Stream, the ice margin seemingly stabilized at the outermost coast for 3500–5500\,years before the mouth of Hardangerfjorden became ice free at c. 14.5\,ka. Subsequently, during the Bølling and Allerød periods, the ice sheet retreated rapidly into the inner parts of Hardangerfjorden before a major ice sheet re‐advance during the Younger Dryas. We identify and reconstruct a sizeable, independent ice cap on the Ulvanosa mountain massif during the Younger Dryas (YD), a massif that earlier was mapped as covered by the Scandinavian Ice Sheet during the YD. We also document ice‐free areas that are more extensive than previously thought between Hardangerfjorden and Matersfjorden during the YD.},

  abstract = {Based on records from the northern North Sea and southern Norway, Quaternary Fennoscandian glaciations are described and discussed. Maximum glaciation, defined as the presence of shelf edge glaciation, an ice stream flowing out of the Norwegian Channel and most likely an ice divide over the central part of Fennoscandia (Sweden, Gulf of Bothnia), occurred for the first time in the late Cenozoic at ca. 1.1myr (the Fedje Glaciation). This glaciation was followed by a ca. 600kyr period with at least two glaciations with ice extension somewhat larger than the Younger Dryas event in the region. The first maximum glaciation of the Bruhnes Chron was during isotope stage 12 and was followed by repeated maximum glaciations within each of the light isotopic stages until stage 2. During the Weichselian, the southwestern part of the Fennoscandian ice sheet reached maximum position three times (sometime between 22 and 28, 37 and 50, and 60 and 80ka). Limited glaciations probably occurred during stadials between the early and middle Weichselian interstadials, between 500ka and 1.1Myr, and most likely also prior to 1.1Myr. Deep Norwegian Sea Ice Rafted Detritus (IRD) records, reflecting contributions from several different ice sheets (Fennoscandian, Barents Sea, Iceland and Greenland), each with large variations in history of ice extent to their respective margins, yet to some degree they reflect the glaciation of the northern North Sea region with an increasing IRD input around 1.1Myr and a relatively low input of North Sea components, during some cycles around the B/M boundary. Maximum glaciations occurred during insolation minima in the earlier part of the Middle Pleistocene, however, not all such minima are reflected by maximum glaciation in southern parts of Fennoscandia. The relatively poor chronological control and non-continuous character of the data on Weichselian interstadials/stadials precludes a clear relationship to atmospheric changes recorded in Greenland ice cores, as well as to precession and/or obliquity cycles in insolation.},

  abstract = {The Norwegian Channel between Skagerrak, in the southeast, and the continental margin of the northern North Sea, in the northwest, is the result of processes related to repeated ice stream activity through the last 1.1 m yr. In such periods the Skagerrak Trough (700 m deep) has acted as a confluence area for glacial ice from southeastern Norway, southern Sweden and parts of the Baltic. Possibly related to the threshold in the Norwegian Channel off Jæren (250 m deep), the ice stream, on a number of occasions over the last 400 ka, inundated the coastal lowlands and left an imprint of NW‐oriented ice directional features (drumlins, stone orientations in tills and striations). Marine interstadial sediments found up to 200 m a.s.l. on Jæren have been suggested to reflect glacial isostasy related to the Norwegian Channel Ice Stream (NCIS). In the channel itself, the ice stream activity is evidenced by mega‐scale glacial lineations on till surfaces. As a result of subsidence, the most complete sedimentary records of early phases of the NCIS are preserved close to the continental margin in the North Sea Fan region. The strongest evidence for ice stream erosion during the last glacial phase is found in the Skagerrak. On the continental slope the ice stream activity is evidenced by the large North Sea Fan, which is mainly a result of deposition of glacial‐fed debris flows. Northwards of the North Sea Fan, rapid deposition of meltwater plume deposits, possibly related to the NCIS, is detected as far north as the Vøring Plateau. The NCIS system offers a unique possibility to study ice stream related processes and the impact the ice stream development had on open ocean sedimentation and circulation.},

Combined with ice sheet modelling and palaeoceanographic data, our reconstruction shows that the deglaciation, from a peak volume of 20\,m of sea-level rise equivalent, was mainly driven by temperature forced surface mass balance in the south, and by Nordic Seas oceanic conditions in the north. Our results highlight the nonlinearity in the response of an ice sheet to forcing and the significance of ocean-ice-atmosphere dynamics in assessing the fate of contemporary ice sheets.},

  abstract = {The geomorphological disposition of (para/peri) glacial landforms, elemental geochemistry, and optical chronology of the relict lake sediment in the Southern Zanskar ranges, northwest Himalaya are used to understand the relationship between glacial dynamics and the lake sedimentation during the mid-Holocene climate variability. Following the Last Glacial Maxima (LGM), pulsating deposition of outwash gravels until the early Holocene overwhelmed the Zanskar valley. The obstruction of Tsarap Chu (chu~=~river) by alluvial fans during the mid-Holocene led to the development of Padum Lake. In the present study, cirque glacier moraines representing three minor glacial advances were mapped along with sedimentological details and dated using Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating technique. The oldest cirque glacier advance - Padum Cirque moraine-3 (PDCm-3) is dated to 11.4~±~0.9~ka. The succeeding advance (PDCm-2) is dated to 5.3~±~0.6 and 4.8~±~0.8~ka whereas, the younger cirque glacier advance (PDCm-1) remains undated. The mid to late Holocene climate variability inferred using major and trace element geochemistry of the relict Padum lake sediments supported by optical chronology indicates six centennial to millennial-scale climatic phases. The prominent warmer phases are represented by decreased mineralogical fine grain flux (low K/Ti, Fe/Si, and Al/Si) with a corresponding increased coarse grain flux (higher Ti/Al and Sr/Al ratios). These phases are dated between 5.9 and 5.5~ka (phase-I), 3.8 and 3.4~ka (phase-IV), and 2.8 and 2.5~ka (phase-VI). The increased mineralogical finer fraction (higher K/Ti, Fe/Si, and Al/Si) between 5.5 and 5.1~ka (phase-II) and 3.4 and 2.8~ka (phase-V) indicate reduced meltwater flux during cooler phases. The intervening phase-III (5.1–3.8~ka) is characterized by increased mineralogical coarse grain flux (decreasing K/Ti, Fe/Si, Al/Si) suggesting gradual warming. The oscillatory climate at millennial scale was further used to understand glacier dynamics. The PDCm-2 advance in the lake record corresponds to the first major cooling (5.5 and 5.1~ka; phase-II) and continued until ∼3.8~ka. Using geochemical data of lake record, a major recession is inferred after 3.8~ka that persisted until around 3.4~ka (phase-IV). Similarly, the undated younger cirque glacier advance (PDCm-1) is assigned to the second cooling event (3.4 and 2.8~ka; phase-V). Thereafter, the cirque glaciers receded, most likely under increasing dryness and fluctuating climate (2.8–2.5~ka, phase-VI). After ∼2.6~ka, the development of ice-wedge pseudomorphs indicates the onset of permafrost conditions that degraded after ∼2.5~ka implying an increase in air temperature. The lake sedimentation terminates with the deposition of multiple younger alluvial fan facies. The climate variability shows a close correspondence with regional climate records suggesting that marginal glacier advancements were triggered by enhanced moisture via atmospheric rivers and cooler winter temperatures. The study highlights the potential of relict lake sediment in association with para- and peri-glacial landforms to reconstruct the pattern of minor glacier responses to climate variability during the Holocene.},

Here we measure abundances of cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al in bedrock and transported boulders to unveil the glaciation and erosion history of Dove Bugt, northeast Greenland. In agreement with studies of west Greenland, we find that apparent exposure ages increase with elevation from 9 ka to 13 ka in low-lying valleys to 21 ka to 204 ka on high-elevation, blockfield-covered plateaus. We employ a Markov chain Monte Carlo inversion framework to constrain the probability of various erosion histories, and we quantify the residence time of samples within the upper 2 m of the bedrock subsurface—a measure defined as the cosmogenic nuclide memory. This cosmogenic nuclide memory exceeds 600 ka on the highest plateaus but is limited to less than 500 ka in most other high-elevation samples and to less than 100 ka at low-elevations. Our results define maximum limits for the fraction of ice cover during the past 1 Ma to ∼70\% on the Store Koldewey peaks and ∼90\% farther inland at Pusterdal, respectively. Minimum limits to ice cover, however, cannot be reliably constrained by the data. Finally, we propose that limited erosion on the highest plateaus of Store Koldewey since 0.6–1.0 Ma indicates a minimum age for fjord-plateau formation within this area of northeast Greenland.},

The results reveal a diverse pattern that is caused by spatially greatly varying glacier sensitivity, in particular to precipitation availability and changes. We introduce a spatially resolved zonation where ICESat samples are grouped into units of similar glacier behaviour, glacier type and topographic settings. In several regions, our new zonation reveals local differences and anomalies that have not been described previously. Glaciers in the Eastern Pamirs, Kunlun Shan and central TP were thickening by 0.1–0.7\&thinsp;m\&thinsp;a\textsuperscript{−1}, and the thickening anomaly has a crisp boundary in the Eastern Pamirs that continues just north of the central Karakoram. Glaciers in the south and east of the TP were thinning, with increasing rates towards southeast. We attribute the glacier thickening signal to a stepwise increase in precipitation around ∼1997–2000 on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The precipitation change is reflected by growth of endorheic lakes in particular in the northern and eastern TP. We estimate lake volume changes through a combination of repeat lake extents from Landsat data and shoreline elevations from ICESat and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) for over 1300 lakes. The rise in water volume contained in the lakes corresponds to 4–25\&thinsp;mm\&thinsp;a\textsuperscript{−1}, when distributed over entire catchments, for the areas where we see glacier thickening. The precipitation increase is also visible in sparse in situ measurements and MERRA-2 climate reanalysis data but less visible in ERA-Interim reanalysis data. Taking into account evaporation loss, the difference between average annual precipitation during the 1990s and 2000s suggested by these datasets is 34–100\&thinsp;mm\&thinsp;a\textsuperscript{−1}, depending on region, which can fully explain both lake growth and glacier thickening (Kunlun Shan) or glacier geometry changes such as thinning tongues while upper glacier areas were thickening or stable (eastern TP). The precipitation increase reflected in these glacier changes possibly extended to the northern slopes of the Tarim Basin, where glaciers were nearly in balance in 2003–2008. Along the entire Himalaya, glaciers on the first orographic ridge, which are exposed to abundant precipitation, were thinning less than glaciers in the dryer climate of the inner ranges. Thinning rates in the Tien Shan vary spatially but are rather stronger than in other parts of HMA.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Efforts to date the oldest modern human fossils in eastern Africa, from Omo-Kibish1–3 and Herto4,5 in Ethiopia, have drawn on a variety of chronometric evidence, including 40Ar/39Ar ages of stratigraphically associated tuffs. The ages that are generally reported for these fossils are around 197\,thousand years (kyr) for the Kibish Omo I3,6,7, and around 160–155\,kyr for the Herto hominins5,8. However, the stratigraphic relationships and tephra correlations that underpin these estimates have been challenged6,8. Here we report geochemical analyses that link the Kamoya’s Hominid Site (KHS) Tuff9, which conclusively overlies the member of the Omo-Kibish Formation that contains Omo I, with a major explosive eruption of Shala volcano in the Main Ethiopian Rift. By dating the proximal deposits of this eruption, we obtain a new minimum age for the Omo fossils of 233\,±\,22\,kyr. Contrary to previous arguments6,8, we also show that the KHS Tuff does not correlate with another widespread tephra layer, the Waidedo Vitric Tuff, and therefore cannot anchor a minimum age for the Herto fossils. Shifting the age of the oldest known Homo sapiens fossils in eastern Africa to before around 200\,thousand years ago is consistent with independent evidence for greater antiquity of the modern human lineage10.},

Here we present an estimate of past CH               4               flux during deglaciation from bubbling from thermokarst (thaw) lakes. Based on high rates of CH               4               bubbling from contemporary arctic thermokarst lakes, high CH               4               production potentials of organic matter from Pleistocene-aged frozen sediments, and estimates of the changing extent of these deposits as thermokarst lakes developed during deglaciation, we find that CH               4               bubbling from newly forming thermokarst lakes comprised 33 to 87\% of the high-latitude increase in atmospheric methane concentration and, in turn, contributed to the climate warming at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition.},

  abstract = {The last 6000years are of particular interest to the understanding of the Earth System because the boundary conditions of the climate system did not change dramatically (in comparison to larger glacial–interglacial changes), and because abundant, detailed regional palaeoclimatic proxy records cover this period. We use selected proxy-based reconstructions of different climate variables, together with state-of-the-art time series of natural forcings (orbital variations, solar activity variations, large tropical volcanic eruptions, land cover and greenhouse gases), underpinned by results from General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMICs), to establish a comprehensive explanatory framework for climate changes from the Mid-Holocene (MH) to pre-industrial time. The redistribution of solar energy, due to orbital forcing on a millennial timescale, was the cause of a progressive southward shift of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). This was accompanied by a pronounced weakening of the monsoon systems in Africa and Asia and increasing dryness and desertification on both continents. The associated summertime cooling of the NH, combined with changing temperature gradients in the world oceans, likely led to an increasing amplitude of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and, possibly, increasingly negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) indices up to the beginning of the last millennium. On decadal to multi-century timescales, a worldwide coincidence between solar irradiance minima, tropical volcanic eruptions and decadal to multi-century scale cooling events was not found. However, reconstructions show that widespread decadal to multi-century scale cooling events, accompanied by advances of mountain glaciers, occurred in the NH (e.g., in Scandinavia and the European Alps). This occurred namely during the Little Ice Age (LIA) between AD ∼1350 and 1850, when the lower summer insolation in the NH, due to orbital forcing, coincided with solar activity minima and several strong tropical volcanic eruptions. The role of orbital forcing in the NH cooling, the southward ITCZ shift and the desertification of the Sahara are supported by numerous model simulations. Other simulations have suggested that the fingerprint of solar activity variations should be strongest in the tropics, but there is also evidence that changes in the ocean heat transport took place during the LIA at high northern latitudes, with possible additional implications for climates of the Southern Hemisphere (SH).},

  abstract = {Thermal modeling is a powerful tool to infer the temperature regime of the ground in permafrost areas. We present a transient permafrost model, CryoGrid 2, that calculates ground temperatures according to conductive heat transfer in the soil and in the snowpack. CryoGrid 2 is forced by operational air temperature and snow-depth products for potential permafrost areas in Southern Norway for the period 1958 to 2009 at 1 km2 spatial resolution. In total, an area of about 80 000 km2 is covered. The model results are validated against borehole temperatures, permafrost probability maps from “bottom temperature of snow” measurements and inventories of landforms indicative of permafrost occurrence. The validation demonstrates that CryoGrid 2 can reproduce the observed lower permafrost limit to within 100 m at all validation sites, while the agreement between simulated and measured borehole temperatures is within 1 K for most sites. The number of grid cells with simulated permafrost does not change significantly between the 1960s and 1990s. In the 2000s, a significant reduction of about 40 \% of the area with average 2 m ground temperatures below 0 ◦C is found, which mostly corresponds to degrading permafrost with still negative temperatures in deeper ground layers. The thermal conductivity of the snow is the largest source of uncertainty in CryoGrid 2, strongly affecting the simulated permafrost area. Finally, the prospects of employing CryoGrid 2 as an operational soil-temperature product for Norway are discussed.},

  abstract = {Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is a popular geophysical subsurfaceimaging technique and widely applied to mineral prospecting, hydrological exploration, environmental investigation and civil engineering, as well as archaeological mapping. This chapter offers an overall review of technical aspects of ERT, which includes the fundamental theory of direct-current (DC) resistivity exploration, electrode arrays for data acquisition, numerical modelling methods and tomographic inversion algorithms. The section of fundamental theory shows basic formulae and principle of DC resistivity exploration. The section of electrode arrays summarises the previous study on all traditional-electrode arrays and recommends 4 electrode arrays for data acquisition of surface ERT and 3 electrode arrays for cross-hole ERT. The section of numerical modelling demonstrates an advanced version of finite-element method, called Gaussian quadrature grid approach, which is advantageous to a numerical simulation of ERT for complex geological models. The section of tomographic inversion presents the generalised standard conjugate gradient algorithms for both the l1- and l2-normed inversions. After that, some synthetic and real imaging examples are given to show the near-surface imaging capabilities of ERT.},
