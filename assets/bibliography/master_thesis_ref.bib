  abstract={The weak equivalence principle (WEP) in the quantum regime has been the subject of many studies with a broad range of approaches to the problem. Here, we tackle the problem anew through the time of arrival (TOA) operator approach. This is done by constructing the TOA operator for a nonrelativistic and structureless particle that is projected upward in a uniform gravitational field with an intended arrival point below the classical turning point. The TOA operator is constructed under the constraint that the inertial and gravitational masses are equivalent and that Galilean invariance is preserved. These constraints are implemented by Weyl quantization of the corresponding classical TOA function for the projectile. The expectation value of the TOA operator is explicitly shown to be equal to the classical time of arrival plus mass-dependent quantum correction terms, implying incompatibility of the WEP with quantum mechanics. The full extent of the violation of the WEP is shown through the mass dependence of TOA distribution for the projectile.},
