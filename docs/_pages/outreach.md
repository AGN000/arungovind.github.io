I am passionate about creating and regularly participating in outreach and mentorship programs that encourage and inspire young scientists, particularly historically underrepresented minorities, to follow their scientific
curiosities.

I am a scholar of Duke’s IMSD program, [BioCoRE](https://medschool.duke.edu/about-us/diversity-and-inclusion/biocore-program){:target="_blank"}, a community that is focused on and committed to supporting diversity and inclusion in the biomedical sciences.

As a PhD student, I founded a new student group, [MicroMoles: Learning STEMs from Curiosity](https://sites.duke.edu/micromoles/){:target="_blank"}, focused on writing short, illustrated children’s stories based on recent graduate student publications. The ultimate goal of MicroMoles is to expose children to recent science in a fun and engaging way. Introducing these advanced subjects at a younger age will increase science literacy as well as
spark interest for future careers in a STEM field.

In the summer of 2018, I was a graduate assistant for the Summer Scholars Program in Genome Sciences and Medicine, a summer research opportunity for freshmen and sophomore underrepresented minority undergraduates. Through that program I mentored nine students while they worked on their research, abstracts, and posters. I also designed and led workshops on communicating with advisors and applying to graduate schools.

In 2018-2019, I participated in the [Morehead Planetarium and Science Center](https://moreheadplanetarium.org/){:target="_blank"}'s [IMPACTS Scholar program](https://www.ncsciencefestival.org/impacts){:target="_blank"}. With the help of a professional informal
educator, I have developed short activities engaging the general public at expos, such as the [Art of Cool](http://aocfestival.com/){:target="_blank"}, as well as longer activities relating to my specific research for
classroom and field trip visits. The program also offered workshops on effective scientific communication at public engagement activities. 

I have also volunteered at the [North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences](https://naturalsciences.org/){:target="_blank"} where I assisted visitors in self-exploration of the specimen collection on display and the museum’s makerspace.

Additionally, I have been an active member of my graduate department’s outreach committee through which I have visited schools for science nights with interactive genetics-related activities and taught a short class on DNA for the [Females Excelling More in Math and Science](https://sites.duke.edu/femmes/){:target="_blank"} (FEMMES) capstone event on Duke’s campus.
