Welcome! Here's where I wrote thoughts on various open source Large Language
Model adjacent projectsand random things I'm doing.  I'm a former Staff
Software Engineer from Google Translate and I'm now spending some time
exploring the world of smaller teams and companies.  I sometimes take on
contractor work related to LLMs.  During winter, I spend a lot of time skiing
in Hakuba Japan (if you find yourself there, say hello and I can show you
around).
