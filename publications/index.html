While theories may be the most valuable outputs of research to those wishing to apply them, for researchers themselves there are other kinds of contribution important to progress in the field. This is what relates it to the immediate subject of this special journal issue on theory in CER. We adopt as our criterion for value ?contribution to knowledge?. This paper?s main contributions are: ? A set of 12 categories of contribution which together indicate the extent of this terrain of contributions to research. ? Leading into that is a collection of ideas and misconceptions which are drawn on in defining and motivating ?ground rules?, which are hints and guidance on the need for various often neglected categories. These are also helpful in justifying some additional categories which make the set as a whole more useful in combination. These are followed by some suggested uses for the categories, and a discussion assessing how the success of the paper might be judged.

Consequently, it is important that computing science and software engineering graduates are able to produce effective cyber security policy. However, written assessments, such as cyber security policy, for some students may be challenging due to lack of familiarity with such assessments. The lack of familiarity or poor assessment literacy not only has the potential to produce poor results, but can led to disappointment and frustration. In this poster, the practice of integrating peer-review as part of a cyber security policy assessment task to support assessment literacy is presented.

Similarly, while a growing collection of literature exists on educational theory and practice in computing education, much of this focuses on the same concepts and concerns. An aspiration is that both these problems can be simultaneously addressed by computing educators adopting a cycle of embracing existing literature when devising teaching practice and then feeding their experience and findings back to the community in a rigorous fashion. Consequently, this panel supports computing educators by acting as advisers on a one-on-one basis to support audience members in discovering or devising their own cycle of teaching practice and computing education research.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2020</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten216700" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Keeping Software Engineering Students in Touch With Not Only What They Are to Learn, But With Why</div> <div class="author"> Syed Waqar Nabi, <em>Joseph Maguire</em>, Steve Draper, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

This entails deciding the order of topics, and explaining that to students. Sequence in the course is only one kind of relationship between topics in the module; relevance to work is another. Such explaining is a neglected educational issue. This paper addresses how to convey these relationships to learners. Because of the WBL context, it is inevitable that questions about how pieces of academic learning relate to the work context (which these students are already experiencing) arise immediately and vividly for them. This is important because it affects learner motivation, sometimes greatly, and also whether they are likely to learn in a surface or a deep mode. A given learner’s grasp of these relationships is both individual and changes over time. Because of this, the general pedagogical approach discussed here is ?little and often?: raising it a number of times, with an emphasis not on one exhaustive and rigid view but on how different students often see it differently, and encouraging each to gradually develop their own view. The concept map diagram in this paper illustrates only one example of how the web of connections might be represented and conveyed during the course.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten224248" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Supporting the Computing Science Education Research Community with Rolling Reviews</div> <div class="author"> <em>Joseph Maguire</em>, and Quintin Cutts</div> <div class="periodical"> Sep 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The recent experience of delivering the United Kingdom and Ireland Computing Education Research (UKICER) conference has provided insight into the strength and vibrancy of the computing education research community within the region.

We examine peer review from three viewpoints, those of community, process, and expectations: The community of reviewers How are reviewers recruited and selected? How are they trained? What feedback do they get? What roles are there in the review process? What titles correspond to these roles? Process: from review to decision How are reviewers matched to papers? How are the reviews used in making accept/reject decisions? What are the possible decisions? Are there multi- ple rounds of reviewing? What information is shared among reviewers, program chairs, and authors? Expectations What is a reviewer expected to do when review- ing a paper? What are the reviews intended to accomplish, and who is the intended audience? What are the ethical rules associated with reviewing? How is a reviewer supposed to deal with issues of broken anonymity (if applicable)? This examination is based on multiple data sources: published standards and descriptions from computing education conferences and journals; interviews with people who have served in various edito- rial and reviewing roles; papers and stated review principles from other disciplines.

This report does not attempt to set standards for reviewing; rather, as a first step toward meeting the need for well qualified reviewers, it presents an overview of the ways peer review is used in various venues, both inside computing education and, for comparison, in closely-related areas outside our field. It considers four key components of peer review in some depth: criteria, the review process, roles and responsibilities, and ethics and etiquette.

An ability to react, collaborate and adapt in changing environments and to evolving timelines are valuable skills required for any professional software engineering role. However, communicating the value of such skills as well as providing opportunities for students to refine skills is challenging.

In a global survey, 2,300 security managers reported that 59% of their security positions were unfilled, although 82% anticipated cyberattacks to their systems. At the same time, the cybersecurity field is broadening, not only in technical concepts but also in human factors, business processes, and international law. The field has not become culturally diversified, however. Professionals hired in 2018 included only 24.9% women, 12.3% African Americans, and 6.8% Latinos. These realities create an opportunity for higher education: diversify the profession while increasing the numbers of skilled computer scientists. New and integrated methods of attracting student populations in the field of cybersecurity are needed. This working group report analyzes the outcomes and approaches used in higher education to diversify the cybersecurity field through a review of the literature, identification of gaps, and recommendations for cybersecurity education researchers and practitioners.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Snow_2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Towards a Taxonomy of Video for HCI Education</div> <div class="author"> Stephen Snow,  Joseph Maguire, Chris Evans, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 5 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '5 more authors' ?

The reality is that while advanced economies require many more skilled software engineers, universities are not delivering them. This is at least true in the context of the United Kingdom, where there are high numbers of software engineering vacancies and unemployed software engineering graduates. A possible explanation could be that curriculum content of software engineering programmes in universities needs to be reconsidered to meet the needs of industry. However, reconsidering curriculum content alone is unlikely to be transformative as there is little to be gained from changing to an emerging methodology, language or framework. Instead, an alternative direction could be to reconsider curriculum delivery and the identity of software engineering within computing science itself. In this paper, we contextualise the challenge by considering the history of software engineering education and some of its key developments. We then consider some of the alternative delivery approaches, before arguing cooperative programmes provide a opportunity for institutions to reconsider software engineering education.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten194253" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Mentoring Mentors in Cooperative Software Engineering Education Programmes</div> <div class="author"> <em>Joseph Maguire</em>, Nathalie Sheridan, Steve Draper, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

Mentors in the workplace are crucial in such cooperative programmes as they scaffold appropriate development activities for students. A workplace mentor in this situation is important not only for the development of detailed technical knowledge, but also in the development of software engineering skills that are almost never in fact taught in higher education, e.g. navigating large, neglected code bases. Consequently, workplace mentors are a key component of any high-quality education programme delivered in partnership with industry. However, higher education institutions and enterprises not only need to appreciate the importance of mentors in such schemes, but also ensure such staff are supported to use their experience to increase their skill as a mentor. Mentors need the space and support to reflect on their own practice, develop skills and attain new knowledge. In this sense, the challenge is not dissimilar to that faced by computing science school teachers that need to continually consider their own practice as well as have the time to consider emerging programming languages and frameworks. Many of the structures and existing research on how to support computing science school teachers could be adapted to support these workplace mentors, e.g. support groups. In this poster, we present initial research and models for mentoring mentors in cooperative software engineering programmes. The aim is to share initial work, receive feedback and to connect with potential collaborators.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten190281" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Devising Work-based Learning Curricula With Apprentice Research Software Engineers</div> <div class="author"> <em>Joseph Maguire</em>, Quintin Cutts, Jack Parkinson, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

The tension between security and convenience, when creating passwords, is well established. It is a tension that often leads users to create poor passwords. For security designers, three mitigation strategies exist: issuing passwords, mandating minimum strength levels or encouraging better passwords. The first strategy prompts recording, the second reuse, but the third merits further investigation. It seemed promising to explore whether users could be subtly nudged towards stronger passwords. Aim. The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of visual nudges on self-chosen password length and/or strength. Method. A university application, enabling students to check course dates and review grades, was used to support two consecutive empirical studies over the course of two academic years. In total, 497 and 776 participants, respectively, were randomly assigned either to a control or an experimental group. Whereas the control group received no intervention, the experimental groups were presented with different visual nudges on the registration page of the web application whenever passwords were created. The experimental groups? password strengths and lengths were then compared that of the control group. Results. No impact of the visual nudges could be detected, neither in terms of password strength nor length. The ordinal score metric used to calculate password strength led to a decrease in variance and test power, so that the inability to detect an effect size does not definitively indicate that such an effect does not exist. Conclusion. We cannot conclude that the nudges had no effect on password strength. It might well be that an actual effect was not detected due to the experimental design choices.

The tension between security and convenience, when creating passwords, is well established. It is a tension that often leads users to create poor passwords. For security designers, three mitigation strategies exist: issuing passwords, mandating minimum strength levels or encouraging better passwords. The first strategy prompts recording, the second reuse, but the third merits further investigation. It seemed promising to explore whether users could be subtly nudged towards stronger passwords. Aim. The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of visual nudges on self-chosen password length and/or strength. Method. A university application, enabling students to check course dates and review grades, was used to support two consecutive empirical studies over the course of two academic years. In total, 497 and 776 participants, respectively, were randomly assigned either to a control or an experimental group. Whereas the control group received no intervention, the experimental groups were presented with different visual nudges on the registration page of the web application whenever passwords were created. The experimental groups? password strengths and lengths were then compared that of the control group. Results. No impact of the visual nudges could be detected, neither in terms of password strength nor length. The ordinal score metric used to calculate password strength led to a decrease in variance and test power, so that the inability to detect an effect size does not definitively indicate that such an effect does not exist. Conclusion. We cannot conclude that the nudges had no effect on password strength. It might well be that an actual effect was not detected due to the experimental design choices. Another possible explanation for our result is that password choice is influenced by the user?s task, cognitive budget, goals and pre-existing routines. A simple visual nudge might not have the power to overcome these forces. Our lessons learned therefore recommend the use of a richer password strength quantification measure, and the acknowledgement of the user?s context, in future studies.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten169642" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Preserving Privacy and Reconceptualising Sharing in Active Learning Spaces</div> <div class="author"> <em>Joseph Maguire</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Higher Education Academy Annual Conference 2017</em>, Jul 2017 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Active Learning Spaces present opportunities and challenges for learning in higher education.

TEAL spaces support students in projecting presentations (e.g. from smart-phones) and sharing notes (e.g. from smart-watches) with peers. Importantly, this sharing is partly amongst their co-present small group but sometimes to the whole class. However, plugging personal things into smart spaces whose first requirement is to accept as many devices as possible is not without consequence. A projected notification of a political conversation, for example, has the potential to harm the individual both within the space and beyond, opening them to unwanted judgment, criticism and assessment. The traditional argument from the usable security community is that of intervention prior to any use whatever: users need to be trained, taught and/or nudged to avoid such problems. We conducted an informal focus group with students in a pilot TEAL space, exploring issues around the privacy and security of using personal devices in such spaces. The reality is that it is hard to perceive the privacy and security challenges prior to using the space. We argue that such prior interventions are not only a significant barrier to student adoption of smart spaces, but ineffective in ensuring the safety of individuals in the long-term. We argue that in designing smart spaces, both on-campus and off, designers need to adopt an approach of individually evolved privacy requirements to ensure an on-going safe, creative space for students. Two important features are: (a) as a small group develops bonds, its privacy level needs to be reduced over time and (b) the best privacy level depends on the whether the screen is currently shared with the small group or the large class.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2016</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten116159" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">ZETA - Zero-Trust Authentication: Relying on Innate Human Ability, not Technology</div> <div class="author"> Andreas Gutmann, Karen Renaud, <em>Joseph Maguire</em>, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 4 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '4 more authors' ?

Given the unceasing efforts of attackers worldwide such trustworthiness is increasingly not a given. A variety of technical solutions, such as utilising multiple devices/channels and verification protocols, has the potential to mitigate the threat of untrusted communications to a certain extent. Yet such technical solutions make two assumptions: (1) users have access to multiple devices and (2) attackers will not resort to hacking the human, using social engineering techniques. In this paper, we propose and explore the potential of using human-based computation instead of solely technical solutions to mitigate the threat of untrusted devices and channels. ZeTA (Zero Trust Authentication on untrusted channels) has the potential to allow people to authenticate despite compromised channels or communications and easily observed usage. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We propose the ZeTA protocol with a formal definition and security analysis that utilises semantics and human-based computation to ameliorate the problem of untrusted devices and channels. (2) We outline a security analysis to assess the envisaged performance of the proposed authentication protocol. (3) We report on a usability study that explores the viability of relying on human computation in this context.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="year">2015</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten171886" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">State of Alternative Authentication Research in Scotland</div> <div class="author"> <em>Joseph Maguire</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Centre for Advanced Security Research at Technische Universität Darmstadt Seminar</em>, Feb 2015 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Research into graphical authentication has yet to be meaningfully transferred into industry. This is the case globally, but is concerning in Scotland as considerable research into the area has been published and presented by academics in SICSA universities (e.g. University of Glasgow, Glasgow Caledonian University, Napier University). The lack of knowledge transfer is particularly perplexing given the interest of industry in improving digital security. There are several explanations for the lack of progress, but a prominent issue is the inconsistency in reporting scientific data pertaining to graphical authentication. There is no framework for the reporting of field investigations into graphical authentication solutions. This situation not only hinders knowledge transfer into industry but the progress of research into alternative authentication solutions. Industry and researchers require metrics and strong qualitative data to utilise and progress research in the area. Consequently, the Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance (SICSA) has provided financial support for a research exchange for me to visit and work with Prof. Melanie Volkamer. The primary aim of the proposed exchange is to develop a field evaluation framework for graphical authentication solutions to ensure consistent reporting of scientific data. The Center for Advanced Security Research at Technische Universität Darmstadt has an established track record of transferring knowledge into industry. Notably, Prof. Melanie Volkamer from the Technische Universität Darmstadt, along with Dr Karen Renaud and myself at the University of Glasgow have collaborated and made progress in transferring knowledge of graphical authentication research into industry.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten115190" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Alternative Authentication in the Wild</div> <div class="author"> <em>Joseph Maguire</em>, and Karen Renaud</div> <div class="periodical"> Jul 2015 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Alphanumeric authentication routinely fails to regulate access to resources with the required stringency, primarily due to usability issues. Initial deployment did not reveal the problems of passwords, deep and profound flaws only emerged once passwords were deployed in the wild. The need for a replacement is widely acknowledged yet despite over a decade of research into knowledge-based alternatives, few, if any, have been adopted by industry. Alternatives are unconvincing for three primary reasons. The first is that alternatives are rarely investigated beyond the initial proposal, with only the results from a constrained lab test provided to convince adopters of their viability. The second is that alternatives are seldom tested realistically where the authenticator mediates access to something of value. The third is that the testing rarely varies the device or context beyond that initially targeted. In the modern world different devices are used across a variety of contexts. What works well in one context may easily fail in another. Consequently, the contribution of this paper is an "in the wild" evaluation of an alternative authentication mechanism that had demonstrated promise in its lab evaluation. In the field test the mechanism was deployed to actual users to regulate access to an application in a context beyond that initially proposed. The performance of the mechanism is reported and discussed. We conclude by reflecting on the value of field evaluations of alternative authentication mechanisms.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten102715" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Regulating Access to Adult Content (with Privacy Preservation)</div> <div class="author"> Karen Renaud, and <em>Joseph Maguire</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> Jul 2015 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>In the physical world we have well-established mechanisms for keeping children out of adult-only areas.

This paper presents a mechanism that exploits the adult’s more extensive exposure to public media, relying on the likelihood that they will be able to recall details if cued by a carefully chosen picture. We conducted an online study to gauge the viability of this scheme. With our prototype we were able to predict that the user was a child 99% of the time.

Some users will stay on the beaten track; others will diverge and take risky shortcuts. If user-preferred and developer-created paths diverge too much, it is time for the developer to consider a new path. A case in point is the humble password. They fill an important developer need: a cheap and easy mechanism to control access and enforce accountability. Unfortunately, users find the constant requests for authentication a nuisance. They respond by walking down risky paths that compromise the mechanism but allow them to satisfy goals more quickly. The answer, for some researchers, has been to come up with password alternatives. This focus is misguided, since the alternatives do nothing to reduce the authentication footprint. The reality is that developers overuse authentication. The problem is not the authentication step, but rather its position in the path. Authentication is sometimes used even when there is no real need for it. This creates confusion in the user?s mind about the consequences of authentication: sometimes it authorises significant side effects and other times it is difficult to identify its raison d?etre. Here we suggest some developer patterns which minimise authentication requests, emphasising necessity rather than gratuitousness.

Whereas users could probably put up with this if it happens relatively infrequently, this tends not to be the case. An authentication prompt is presented a number of times during the day. Sometimes it has serious consequences, such as when it is required to authorise the purchase of a digital item, and the permits consequent credit card charge. Other times it merely identifies the user to allow the system to customise the interface. The range of consequences and the multiplicity of systems mandating shared secrets collide with human limitations and the current password bloat and general end-user exasperation. Is it at all possible to improve authentication? As researchers, we have primarily addressed this problem in one of three ways: (1) by trying to find a password replacement, (2) by formulating rules and regulations to coerce users into choosing stronger passwords, or (3) fostering a security culture within the organisation, hoping that the social pressure will induce people to behave more securely. These endeavours have met with limited success. Alternatives have not been embraced by the developer community, rules and regulations are often ignored, subverted or deliberately flouted. Fostering a security culture has had more success, in relative terms, but still has not really addressed the ?authentication problem?. The one thing these approaches have in common is their focus on the human agent: the end user. Consider a related problem in the physical world: locks on doors. These have not changed in centuries and the doors themselves are probably weaker than they were a hundred years ago. Yet do locks really prevent intrusion? A determined intruder finds the average lock an minor deterrent, and the door itself is sometimes even made of glass, allowing the thief to subvert the lock entirely. Yet one never hears about a desperate search for a door or lock replacement. One doesn?t hear the refrain, ?How do you solve a problem like the door lock? This even though they, too, are lost, copied and shared. Why, when it comes to virtual locks, is there such a drive to come up with the perfect locking mechanism? The password and the average door lock function similarly: neither is perfect but both provide an acceptable measure of security. Here we will argue that it might be time to suspend our unrealistic expectations that we can find a perfect lock in the virtual world when we live quite happily with imperfect security in the physical world.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten102862" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Are Graphical Authentication Mechanisms as Strong as Passwords?</div> <div class="author"> Karen Renaud, Peter Mayer, Melanie Volkamer, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

The first is the most popular, in the form of the password. This is often referred to as ?knowledge-based? authentication. Yet, given the guidelines for password restrictions commonly given to end-users we will argue that this is a misnomer. A strong password is actually a lengthy string of gibberish or nonsense.

Some users will stay on the beaten track; others will diverge and take risky shortcuts. If user-preferred and developer-created paths diverge too much, it is time for the developer to consider a new path. A case in point is the humble password. They fill an important developer need: a cheap and easy mechanism to control access and enforce accountability. Unfortunately, users find the constant requests for authentication a nuisance. They respond by walking down risky paths that compromise the mechanism but allow them to satisfy goals more quickly. The answer, for some researchers, has been to come up with password alternatives. This focus is misguided, since the alternatives do nothing to reduce the authentication footprint. The reality is that developers overuse authentication. The problem is not the authentication step, but rather its position in the path. Authentication is sometimes used even when there is no real need for it. This creates confusion in the user?s mind about the consequences of authentication: sometimes it authorises significant side effects and other times it is difficult to identify its raison d?etre. Here we suggest some developer patterns which minimise authentication requests, emphasising necessity rather than gratuitousness. We believe this will help to ease the current situation by moving towards genuine risk mitigation rather than harming authentication by excessive use thereof.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2012</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="enlighten71011" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">You Only Live Twice or The Years We Wasted Caring about Shoulder-Surfing</div> <div class="author"> K.
